abstract = {Labor market information is an important input to labor, workforce, education, and macroeconomic policy. However, granular and real-time data on labor market trends are lacking; publicly available data from survey samples are released with significant lags and miss critical information such as skills and benefits. We use generative Artificial Intelligence to automatically extract structured labor market information from unstructured online job postings for the entire U.S. labor market. To demonstrate our methodology, we construct a sample of 6,800 job postings stratified by 68 major occupational groups, extract structured information on educational requirements, remote-work flexibility, full-time availability, and benefits, and show how these job characteristics vary across occupations. As a validation, we compare frequencies of educational requirements by occupation from our sample to survey data and find no statistically significant difference. Finally, we discuss the scalability to collections of millions of job postings. Our results establish the feasibility of measuring labor market trends at scale from online job postings thanks to advances in generative AI techniques. Improved access to such insights at scale and in real-time could transform the ability of policy leaders, including federal and state agencies and education providers, to make data-informed decisions that better support the American workforce.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools utilize machine learning models to create new content in response to human-provided prompts, which can automate the creation of large amounts of content in a short time. This study analyzed students' information behavior in small group discussions where the students were encouraged to use generative AI tools. Descriptive and lag sequential analysis methods were employed to examine the characteristics and patterns of students' information behavior according to Ellis' model of information seeking. The results indicated that although students frequently used generative AI tools as primary information sources, they also sought additional resources to satisfy their informational needs. Additionally, students sometimes copied and pasted useful information from generative AI tools into group documents to share with their group members. Lag sequential analysis revealed that students typically began their information seeking process with generative AI tools, followed by exploring additional information sources.},

abstract = {For decades, scholars have emphasized that tasks should be the central focus in Information Retrieval (IR). This point of view holds even more significance with the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, which can, among other capabilities, understand natural language, engage in dialog with users, generate bespoke user interfaces, and power agents to help complete tasks. GenAI presents an unprecedented opportunity to finally realize the potential of tasks in IR, enhance task-focused retrieval and interaction, and create ''magical'' task completion moments for users. In this paper, we explore the rationale and methodology behind this argument. Traditional IR systems support mostly simple tasks. The emergence of GenAI creates an opportunity for IR systems to help users achieve complex tasks and for the IR community to rekindle its interest and demonstrate leadership in this sizable and significant problem space. We underscore the pivotal role of tasks in IR and introduce new evidence supporting the notion that task-centric approaches, abstracted from specific modalities, represent the future of IR. Building on this foundation, we envision the development, utilization, and evaluation of next-generation IR systems. We propose a promising future where IR agents prioritize users, their tasks, and their situations. However, despite their potential to address task-focused and modality-independent IR, agents alone are insufficient. We propose a robust ecosystem around these agents that transcends traditional queries, questions, prompts, and modalities to address users' fundamental needs, tasks, and goals.},

Our empirical study shows: (i) 35.8\% of the 98 Kubernetes manifests generated include at least one instance of smell; (ii) two types of objects Kubernetes namely, Deployment and Service are impacted by identified smells; and (iii) the most frequently occurring smell is unset CPU and memory requirements. Based on our findings, we recommend practitioners to apply quality assurance activities for ChatGPT-generated Kubernetes manifests prior to using these manifests for container orchestration.},

To exceed the limitations of traditional teaching scaffolds that lacked customization, they developed a dynamic scaffold framework based on metacognitive theory and generative artificial intelligence technology. Its structure is mainly composed of behavioral examination research, creative dialogue exchanges, and responses to self-awareness. On the Coze platform, users can build an intelligent agent, select a "three-person voting setup" and a "four-person quiz setup" scenario, and then conduct educational exercises. The results showed that this structure enabled learners to perform superior in goal setting, strategy application, and reflective standard, which shows that self-awareness assistance using general artificial intelligence is indeed very promising in helping people to gain deeper understanding.},

abstract = {The introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022 kickstarted the release of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) applications to the public domain. Such chat interfaces are based on large language models (LLMs) and possess a vast array of abilities spanning conversation, the writing and debugging of code, the writing of papers, and the creation of images, music, and songs. With students now having access to a myriad of GAI tools, academia has been permanently altered.Our proposed system, named Code Analysis and Education Tutor (CAET), integrates GAI into early Computer Science education by providing students with an ethical alternative to existing GAI tools. CAET is designed to assist students with programming tasks in a manner tailored to their individual needs without jeopardizing the integrity of their learning. A point of uniqueness from existing works is CAET's ability to display or hide generated code based on its pertinence to the problem at hand. After subjecting multiple GAI models to common programming errors and queries, we settled on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model due to its comprehensive capabilities and cost-effectiveness. Overall, CAET underscored the model's conversational dynamics and provided insights for creating a more personalized learning experience for students in an introductory computer science course.},

abstract = {CG (Computer Graphics) is a popular field of CS (Computer Science), but many students find this topic difficult due to it requiring a large number of skills, such as mathematics, programming, geometric reasoning, and creativity. Over the past few years, researchers have investigated ways to harness the power of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) to improve teaching. In CS, much of the research has focused on introductory computing. A recent study evaluating the performance of an LLM (Large Language Model), GPT-4 (text-only), on CG questions, indicated poor performance and reliance on detailed descriptions of image content, which often required considerable insight from the user to return reasonable results. So far, no studies have investigated the abilities of LMMs (Large Multimodal Models), or multimodal LLMs, to solve CG questions and how these abilities can be used to improve teaching.In this study, we construct two datasets of CG questions requiring varying degrees of visual perception skills and geometric reasoning skills, and evaluate the current state-of-the-art LMM, GPT-4o, on the two datasets. We find that although GPT-4o exhibits great potential in solving questions with visual information independently, major limitations still exist to the accuracy and quality of the generated results. We propose several novel approaches for CG educators to incorporate GenAI into CG teaching despite these limitations. We hope that our guidelines further encourage learning and engagement in CG classrooms.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (gen-AI) has become ubiquitous in daily life, including classroom environments where students are using it to assist them on their coursework. Given the widespread use of this tool and the lack of knowledge over how it can support learning, there is a need for educators to have a framework for using it in the classroom and teaching their students usage strategies that are beneficial for learning. One pathway forward is through creativity, a process crucial for learning and also connected to the act of using gen-AI. This poster demonstrates the results of a study designed to provide an in-depth view on how creativity intersects with gen-AI usage in a computational physics course. In the course, students learn about computing tools during group-based, open-ended computational physics activities. Students are often tasked with using gen-AI to explore and help make decisions. The findings demonstrate a connection between using gen-AI and engaging in creative processes, and the implications point to strategies for supporting student usage of gen-AI.},

This paper utilizes a SWOT analysis framework to analyze and consolidate existing literature, with a specific focus on Computer Science education. Through the analysis of this literature, we have created a set of use cases and guidelines to aid in the future development of strategies and tools within this field.

Indeed, to achieve trustworthy AI solutions, it is essential to promote AI education as a fundamental step. Educating people to use AI responsibly not only improves their understanding of the technology, but also equips them to address issues of bias and discrimination. Indeed, informed users are more likely to recognize when AI is producing biased or discriminatory results and to demand appropriate solutions. This awareness of the ethical implications of AI decisions is crucial for the responsible and socially conscious adoption of AI.

This short paper investigates GenAI tools, help-seeking preferences and the importance of peer support among first-year software engineering students (n=94). Our responses show that 50\% of the students use GenAI tools as the primary source of help-seeking, and 43\% report that using ChatGPT reduces their need to interact with peers. However, students generally recognize the importance of social interaction and peer support for their learning. We use these duality findings to extend previous recommendations for integrating generative AI in education by providing new recommendations on how educators can support help-seeking and peer support in the age of GenAI.},

abstract = {As personalized recommendation techniques continue to evolve and be applied, recommendation systems face a plethora of malicious attacks. In order to defend against potential malicious attacks, enhance the robustness of recommendation systems, and strengthen their ability to withstand attacks, it is necessary to propose a method based on Variational Graph Auto-encoders (VGAE) for generating shilling attacks. This method improves the VGAE model, models user profiles, and generates reconstructed user profiles that conform to the original rating patterns. By utilizing spectral clustering, users are selected from the original dataset as templates in a dispersed manner according to a certain attack scale. These templates are then matched with the most similar fake users in the reconstructed user profiles. Within these fake user profiles, ratings for the most popular items in each category and target item ratings are inserted. Finally, fake user profiles are generated and injected into the recommendation system to broadly promote target items to users of the system. Experimental results on the MovieLens 100k and 1M datasets demonstrate that this new method exhibits more stable attack performance and stronger detection evasion capabilities compared to traditional attack strategies, thereby better exposing existing issues within recommendation systems.},

Our work builds on this scholarship by investigating how neurodivergent individuals use Large Language Model-based chatbots in real-life settings. We conducted interviews with 15 neurodivergent participants to understand their expansive use of these chatbots, which we present as use case categories. We then designed diary studies to capture prompting strategies participants employ within these use cases while conversing with the Large Language Model-based chatbot Gemini.

abstract = {Lights out! With the escalating climate crisis, eco-feedback has gained prominence over the last decade. However, traditional approaches could be underperforming as they often use data-driven strategies and assume that people only need additional information about their consumption to change behavior. A proposed path to overcome this issue is to design eco-feedback to foster emotional connections with users. However, not much is known about the effectiveness of such designs. In this paper, we propose a novel care-based eco-feedback system. Central to the system is a Tamagotchi-inspired digital character named Infi who gets its life force from the user’s energy savings. Additionally, we harness the latest advancements in generative artificial intelligence to enhance emotional attachment through conversational interactions that users can have with Infi. The results of a randomized controlled experiment (N=420) convey the fact that this design increases emotional attachment, which in turn increases energy-saving behavior.},

Moreover, developments in generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in education, are gaining prominence, yet we do not understand its value or how best to implement it in post-primary educational settings. Despite a growing international body of research in this area, my scoping review highlights that many aspects of these topics have yet to be explored, particularly in the context of post-primary students in Ireland. My study will begin to bridge this gap by exploring how a purposeful sample of LCCS post-primary students in Ireland engage with GAI tools, such as ChatGPT, during their initial experiences learning Python programming. These findings, when approached through the lens of Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence (HCAI), can help enhance pedagogical strategies and lead to improved learning experiences for students.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a widely popular technology that will have a profound impact on society and individuals. Less than a decade ago, it was thought that creative work would be among the last to be automated&nbsp;– yet today, we see AI encroaching on many creative domains. In this paper, we present the findings of a survey study on people’s perceptions of text-to-image generation. We touch on participants’ technical understanding of the emerging technology, their fears and concerns, and thoughts about risks and dangers of text-to-image generation to the individual and society. We find that while participants were aware of the risks and dangers associated with the technology, only few participants considered the technology to be a personal risk. The risks for others were more easy to recognize for participants. Artists were particularly seen at risk. Interestingly, participants who had tried the technology rated its future importance lower than those who had not tried it. This result shows that many people are still oblivious of the potential personal risks of generative artificial intelligence and the impending societal changes associated with this technology.},

However, while broader societal perspectives have been analyzed, specific examinations of how practitioners utilize GenAI tools to enhance their current workflows remain limited. To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study involving 16 professional designers from the automotive industry. We aimed to identify their challenges with existing GenAI image generation tools in daily design practices. Thematic analysis revealed four key themes: (1) the need for visual input-centric multi-modal interfaces that extend beyond textual prompts, (2) the lack of support for the iterative nature of design processes in GenAI tools, (3) difficulties in controlling prompts to achieve desired outputs, and (4) the significance of incorporating human experiences and emotions into design. Based on our findings, we propose and discuss potential design considerations for enhancing future GenAI image generation tool interfaces.},

Generative technologies are developing rapidly and many designers are using them. Yet, there remains little published work on the use of GenAI in design. Our goal is to not only showcase the potential of GenAI for design, but to engage in discussions of its shortcomings and opportunities as they have been already articulated by scholars. By synthesizing both published and unpublished works, we will develop best practices, ethical considerations, and future research directions for the use of GenAI in design. We will explore a range of topics and themes, including leveraging the characteristics of GenAI for design, mapping the diverse applications of GenAI in design, envisioning a framework for design, and guiding future work on GenAI in design research. Ultimately, we hope to provide a roadmap for the integration of GenAI into the design research process and to encourage designers and researchers to explore the potential of GenAI in a thoughtful and deliberate way.},

Instructors must determine how students may use AI for course activities and what AI systems they will support and encourage students to use. This task is challenging with the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and related AI systems. The contribution of this work is an experimental evaluation of the performance of multiple open-source and commercial LLMs utilizing retrieval-augmented generation in answering questions for computer science courses and a cost-benefit analysis for instructors when determining what systems to use. A key factor is the time an instructor has to maintain their supported AI systems and the most effective activities for improving their performance.

However, with the complexity of terms in the electric power field, the generic word-based encoding approach of natural language understanding model fails to identify those domain phrases even if they appear in the training samples. To improve the semantic accuracy of special content labeling, this paper proposes a words-phrase fusion encoding NLU model with the help of domain corpus. We pre-train a phrase-level Bert model in the electric power field which is involved during the model encoding step to accurately capture the semantics of domain terms and perceive the boundary of phrases. Additionally, continuous consistency loss of sequences is added to the model to reduce the to reduce the misclassification of individual words in the phrases. Experiment with real dataset in power QA system demonstrates that our model helps improve semantic parsing accuracy on both training and untrained items, alleviates the complete dependency of the phrase encoding model on word segmentation results.},

In a pilot study with 37 fifth-graders, we explored how children (ages 9–10) envision genAI and the roles they believe it should play in their daily life. Our findings reveal three key ways children envision genAI: as a companion providing guidance, a collaborator working alongside them, and a task automator that offloads responsibilities. However, alongside these hopeful views, children expressed fears about overreliance, particularly in academic settings, linking it to fears of diminished learning, disciplinary consequences, and long-term failure. This study highlights the need for child-centric AI design that balances these tensions, empowering children with the skills to critically engage with and navigate their evolving relationships with digital technologies.},

Based on current advanced multilingual model architectures and cross-modal content generation technologies, an automatic generation system for teaching resources supporting 12 languages is constructed.  Experimental data showed that the system led to a 41.2\% increase in learning efficiency in a Tamil course at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) (p&lt;0.01, n=320), while a test of teaching Chinese as a second language at the Beijing Language and Culture University (BLCU) showed that AIGC-generated personalized exercises reduced the learner error rate by 33.7\%.  The study further revealed that (i) the cost of generating instructional materials for low-resource languages (e.g., Kiswahili) decreased to 18.5\% of the traditional approach;  and (ii) through an authoritative equity assessment framework, it was confirmed that the technological solution could narrow the digital education divide between developing and developed countries by up to 27.3 percentage points.  This provides actionable technological support for the equity goals of the UN's Education 2030 Agenda.},

The Curve-25519 algorithm, protected by the security features of elliptical curve algorithms and constant-time operations, presents a challenge for low-cost, non-invasive SCA methods due to its robustness. This work focuses on the leakage of conditional judgment operations that occur before each point addition and point doubling operation. By identifying these information leakage points through SCA, electromagnetic radiation and power consumption information are collected and labeled. We conduct a dataset and transformed 1-dimensional signals into a 2D image for training. The trained model is subsequently used for testing. Experiments demonstrate that this method can effectively analyze leakage points in the Curve-25519 algorithm and help to improve the robustness of the algorithm.},

Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. Following successful workshops in 2022 and 2023, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

abstract = {The first typical generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) model ChatGpt 1 was introduced in 2018, but has not drawn much attention until the release of ChatGpt 3 in 2022. Since then, researchers and educators have been experimenting with Gen AI tools to explore their possibilities in various fields. In education, the use of Gen AI in assessment is a research focus. To reveal the research patterns in this field, the study employed Vosviewer and CiteSpace to analyze 816 papers in the Web of Science (WOS) database published between 2019 and 2024. The annual publications surged during the period of 2023-2024 due to the release of higher versions of Gen AI tools such as ChatGpt 3. Researchers in the United States, United Kingdom and China engage most actively in the field. American and Hong Kong universities are particularly productive. However, the collaboration between institutions and authors still needs to be enhanced. Highly influential journals such as Nature and famous medical journals such as JMIR Medical Education and Cureus Journal of Medical sciences are most frequently cited. The analysis of co-occurrence keywords and keyword clusters identified two research areas: responding to the academic integrity issue with the use of Gen AI in assessment and exploring the valuable use of Gen AI in assessments in higher education especially medical education. Future research could explore the design of innovative or alternative assessments and the use of Gen AI tools in interactive and game-based assessment creation, marking and feedback giving.},

abstract = {Multimodal generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers new affordances for inclusive education, particularly for children with vision impairments (CVIs), by enabling alternate representations that align with non-visual mental models. While GenAI tools are rapidly reshaping mainstream educational practices worldwide, their design and deployment often presume a digitally literate, sighted teaching workforce and well-resourced institutional contexts. In this paper, we address a critical gap in HCI and accessibility research: the near-total absence of empirical studies on teachers with vision impairments (TVIs), who play a central pedagogical role in schools for the blind across the Global South. Through in-depth interviews with 15 TVIs in Karnataka and a nationwide survey of 105 TVIs across 15 Indian states, we surface the everyday teaching practices, technological aspirations, and systemic constraints that shape their engagement with digital technologies, including GenAI. Our findings reveal a disjuncture between the potential of GenAI and the readiness of the institutional and infrastructural ecosystem in which TVIs operate. We document pervasive challenges, including limited access to devices and connectivity, insufficient training, resistance from school management, and entrenched barriers to STEM education, while also highlighting sites of resilience, innovation, and professional commitment. This study advances the HCI discourse by centering disabled educators as key agents in the design of accessible educational futures. We argue that realizing GenAI’s inclusive potential requires moving beyond assistive technology retrofits toward co-designed, contextually grounded systems that respond to the lived realities of TVIs in the Global South.},

This research paper explores the impacts and challenges of integrating Generative AI in content creation within Higher Education. We utilise a literature review and case study approach to gain insights into the potential benefits and complexities of implementing Generative AI in educational settings. Specific research questions are formulated to investigate the influence of Generative AI on content creation efficiency, productivity, quality, and adaptability. The paper also highlights ethical considerations and the evolving role of educators in the AI-driven educational landscape. Furthermore, the research paper examines the practical applications of Generative AI tools such as OpenAI GPT, GPT-Neo, Hugging Face's Transformers Library, Cognii, MosaChat-AI, TeacherMatic, and OpenAI Codex in Higher Education content creation. This comprehensive analysis aims to provide educators, instructional designers, and policymakers with valuable insights and concrete examples of how Generative AI can be leveraged to create personalised learning materials, improve assessment strategies, and enhance the overall educational experience for students pursuing advanced technical subjects. The culmination of this research presents a vision for a future where Generative AI, thoughtfully implemented and ethically managed, empowers educational institutions to meet the diverse and evolving needs of learners in the digital era.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated significant potential in clinical reasoning skills such as history-taking and differential diagnosis generation—critical aspects of medical education. This work explores how LLMs can augment medical curricula through interactive learning. We conducted a participatory design process with medical students, residents and medical education experts to co-create an AI-powered tutor prototype for clinical reasoning. As part of the co-design process, we conducted a qualitative user study, investigating learning needs and practices via interviews, and conducting concept evaluations through interactions with the prototype. Findings highlight the challenges learners face in transitioning from theoretical knowledge to practical application, and how an AI tutor can provide personalized practice and feedback. We conclude with design considerations, emphasizing the importance of context-specific knowledge and emulating positive preceptor traits, to guide the development of AI tools for medical education.},

abstract = {This paper joins the growing body of HCI work on critical AI studies and focuses on the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools in Bangladesh. While the West has started to examine the limitations and risks associated with these tools, their impacts on the Global South have remained understudied. Based on our interviews, focus group discussions (FGD), and social media-based qualitative study, this paper reports how popular text-to-image GAI tools (ex., DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Firefly) are affecting various image-related local creative fields. We report how these tools limit the creative explorations of marginal artists, struggle to understand linguistic nuances, fail to generate local forms of art and architecture, and misrepresent the diversity among citizens in the image production process. Drawing from a rich body of work on critical image theory, postcolonial computing, and design politics, we explain how our findings are pertinent to HCI’s broader interest in social justice, decolonization, and global development.},

abstract = {The adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) in society and business is growing rapidly. While these systems often generate convincing and coherent responses, they risk producing incorrect or non-factual information, known as confabulations or hallucinations. Consequently, users must critically assess the reliability of these outputs when interacting with LLM-based agents. Although advancements such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have improved the technical performance of these systems, there is a lack of empirical models that explain how humans detect confabulations. Building on the explainable AI (XAI) literature, we examine the role of reasoning-based explanations in helping users identify confabulations in LLM systems. An online experiment (n = 97) reveals that analogical and factual explanations improve detection accuracy but require more time and cognitive effort than the no explanation baseline.},

For example, medical staff repeatedly process the contextual data in each stage of the prenatal examinations, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. If a dispute happens, the data will become the evidence to support whether the prenatal examinations were handled appropriately. Therefore, if the prenatal examination data is not accurately recorded and properly preserved, it will become a source of pressure for medical staff to face disputes in the future. This research takes the prenatal examinations of pregnant as a use case. We apply robotic process automation technology to assist in the automation of prenatal examinations and blockchain technology to establish trustworthy prenatal examinations. Besides, we also use generative artificial intelligence technology to provide intelligent user-assisted consultation in open-domain question answering. The contribution of this work is to build an automated reliable prenatal examination information service to provide good care for pregnant.},

Recently, I have been inundated with questions, concerns, and critiques about the rise of augmentation technologies in writing and design processes, particularly generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools that support chat-based text generation and text-to-image production. I'm sure many UX researchers and designers face similar issues in their work. It remains unclear how generative AI should fit into existing workflow or design processes. Common questions include these:• How does AI work? What can it do? Is it free?• Is it cheating if I use AI to produce content?• Who is responsible for the quality of AI-generated content?• To what extent can I outsource my routine work to AI? In other words, what's an acceptable threshold for using AI before it is considered too much?Specific to UX is the value (cost and labor versus gains and effects) of generative AI in the research and design of user-centered products. Students in my UX courses are increasingly worried about the presence of AI and, consequently, the relevance of their developing skill sets in UX. Educators are growing wary about the presence of AI in the context of teaching and learning; many form partially informed decisions on academic policies for AI usage.},

abstract = {The traditional evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems is generally very costly as it requires manual relevance annotation from human experts. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence -specifically large language models (LLMs)- can generate relevance annotations at an enormous scale with relatively small computational costs. Potentially, this could alleviate the costs traditionally associated with IR evaluation and make it applicable to numerous low-resource applications. However, generated relevance annotations are not immune to (systematic) errors, and as a result, directly using them for evaluation produces unreliable results.In this work, we propose two methods based on prediction-powered inference and conformal risk control that utilize computer-generated relevance annotations to place reliable confidence intervals (CIs) around IR evaluation metrics. Our proposed methods require a small number of reliable annotations from which the methods can statistically analyze the errors in the generated annotations. Using this information, we can place CIs around evaluation metrics with strong theoretical guarantees. Unlike existing approaches, our conformal risk control method is specifically designed for ranking metrics and can vary its CIs per query and document. Our experimental results show that our CIs accurately capture both the variance and bias in evaluation based on LLM annotations, better than the typical empirical bootstrapping estimates. We hope our contributions bring reliable evaluation to the many IR applications where this was traditionally infeasible.},

This study examines early user reactions to GenAI, consisting of 725 Reddit threads between 06/2022 and 05/2023. Through natural language processing (NLP) and content analysis, we observe an increasingly negative sentiment in the discussion and identify six main categories of student and faculty experiences of GenAI in education. These experiences reflect concerns about academic integrity and AI’s negative impact on the values of traditional education. Our analysis also highlights the tension and burden imposed by new technologies.

abstract = {Video streaming stands as the cornerstone of telecommunication networks, constituting over 60\% of mobile data traffic as of June 2023. The paramount challenge faced by video streaming service providers is ensuring high Quality of Experience (QoE) for users. In HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS), including DASH and HLS, video content is encoded at multiple quality versions, with an Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithm dynamically selecting versions based on network conditions. Concurrently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the industry, particularly in content recommendation and personalization. Leveraging user data and advanced algorithms, AI enhances user engagement, satisfaction, and video quality through super-resolution and denoising techniques.However, challenges persist, such as real-time processing on resource-constrained devices, the need for diverse training datasets, privacy concerns, and model interpretability. Despite these hurdles, the promise of Generative Artificial Intelligence emerges as a transformative force. Generative AI, capable of synthesizing new data based on learned patterns, holds vast potential in the video streaming landscape. In the context of video streaming, it can create realistic and immersive content, adapt in real time to individual preferences, and optimize video compression for seamless streaming in low-bandwidth conditions.This research proposal outlines a comprehensive exploration at the intersection of advanced AI algorithms and digital entertainment, focusing on the potential of generative AI to elevate video quality, user interactivity, and the overall streaming experience. The objective is to integrate generative models into video streaming pipelines, unraveling novel avenues that promise a future of dynamic, personalized, and visually captivating streaming experiences for viewers.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the main concerns of knowledge workers due to its ability to mimic realistic human reasoning and creativity. However, this integration raises critical concerns about trust and ethics, which are crucial in shaping both the acceptance and effective utilisation of these technologies. There are many reports, articles and papers currently exploring the opportunities and challenges of LLMs in higher education from the perspective of students and educators. However, these papers often focus on specific contexts like in the UK, US or a particular institutions. In this paper, we examine the problems of generative AI in higher education from educator and student perspectives using scientometrics and text analysis to provide an overview of the research landscape, followed by a narrative review and thematic analysis of selected literature. Some findings of this work are: (1) Students and educators found different ways to use generative AI. Students focus more on using it as an assistant (revising and preparing for lectures, helping with homework) and educators as a content production assistant (writing lecture notes, personalising content). Commonalities are that both students and educators use generative AI as an accessibility aid, e.g., to rephrase sentences or explain concepts. (2) The main concerns of higher education regarding generative AI are equity in access, clarity of rules regarding usage, and job displacement.},

Through 12 post-class group interviews, we identified how GenAI co-design behaviors present both benefits—such as enhanced creativity and faster design iterations—and risks, including shallow learning and reflection. Benefits were most evident during the execution phases, while the discovery and reflection phases showed limited gains. A taxonomy of usage patterns revealed that students’ outcomes depended more on how they used GenAI than the specific tasks performed. These findings highlight the need for HCI education to adapt to GenAI’s role and offer recommendations for curricula to better prepare future designers for effective creative co-design.},

abstract = {Prompt and sufficient feedback is essential for students' academic learning since it enables them to review their learning techniques and improve their areas of weakness. Nevertheless, delivering personalised feedback to every student continues to be difficult&nbsp;for teachers due to its demanding and time-intensive nature. While automated feedback systems are available, their primary focus is providing feedback on a single subject, and most of them utilise statistical analysis or traditional machine learning techniques to provide feedback. Moreover, no feedback model utilises the same criteria to generate text-based feedback for more than one subject. Generative artificial intelligence (GEN AI) has recently made incredible progress, and large language models (LLMs) can retain the context from the vast amount of text. Hence, this research presents a framework that employs an innovative technique to offer text-based feedback to students in different fields of study. This framework employs two LLMs, one for generating the feedback and another for categorising it into separate subjects using suitable headings for structural organising. Consequently, the output produced by this technology corresponds to the original tone of the teacher.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) has revolutionized software engineering (SE) by automating tasks across design, coding, and testing [1] [2]. Tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot streamline code generation, architectural modeling, debugging, and test-case creation [3] [4]. Despite their rapid adoption in industry, the pedagogical implications of these tools in computing education have not been systematically examined. This study solves the existing gap by conducting a comprehensive benchmarking study of Gen-AI tools across four core SE phases— design documentation, feature implementation, debugging support, and testing — to address two research questions:RQ1: What strengths and limitations do Gen-AI tools exhibit in each phase?RQ2: How can insights from benchmarking inform effective integration of Gen-AI into SE curricula?To answer these questions, a diverse set of Gen-AI tools is evaluated, ranging from design-focused assistants such as Lucidchart, Mermaid.js and UIzard; implementation-oriented systems including GitHub Copilot, TabNine, Codeium and Supermaven; debugging supports like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet; and testing frameworks such as Testim, Mabl and Applitools—while also surveying emerging platforms (as of summer 2024) like Replit, Postman, Visily, Gemini, Eraser.io and others. For each tool and development phase, we applied phase-specific metrics: in design documentation, we assessed diagram accuracy, completeness, user effort, and IDE integration; in feature implementation, we measured pattern-based code generation quality, code-completion effectiveness, refactoring robustness, and UI/UX scaffolding; in debugging, we evaluated error-detection accuracy, hallucination rates, and clarity of explanatory feedback; and in testing, we examined test-case relevance and defect-detection coverage. Across all phases, we tracked prompt engineering complexity as a key mediating factor influencing tool performance.Our evaluation reveals speed-fidelity trade-offs: Code-completion assistants accelerate boilerplate generation but demand manual oversight to ensure cross-file consistency and manage higher-order abstractions; diagramming tools can produce precise UML models with minimal effort— but at the cost of iterative prompt refinement for complex cases; LLM debuggers deliver context-sensitive fixes yet suffer from nontrivial hallucination rates; testing generators exhibit wide variance in edge-case coverage. On average, tools needed 2.4 prompt iterations for usable diagrams and 1.5 prompts for bug fixes, underscoring the human effort in guiding AI.We recommend a scaffolded framework for integrating Gen-AI into SE education by: embedding AI tools into hands-on assignments, to explore tasks in a controlled context; by structuring small team projects in which one subgroup uses AI assistants while the other completes the same tasks manually (covering design, implementation, debugging and testing) to surface contrasts in workflow, tool strengths, and human reasoning; by requiring students to maintain a reflective journal documenting their AI usage and prompt-engineering strategies, fostering metacognitive insight into how tool inputs shape outputs; and by equipping learners with decision making criteria, teaching them to evaluate AI assistants according to task fit- preparing them to leverage AI responsibly across SE phases in its evolving landscape.},

abstract = {Many English as a Second Language (ESL) students have begun to use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to improve their writing artifacts. In this process, however, ESL students are also facing scrutiny due to the social expectation of independent language acquisition. Therefore, we propose a study design consisting of diary studies and interviews to investigate the ways ESL students perceive and navigate the nuanced social dynamics around using generative AI in their writing. Through this study, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the social-technical implication of AI usage in second language acquisition, and to offer suggestions to ESL learners and educators on ways to incorporate AI into their educational journey.},
