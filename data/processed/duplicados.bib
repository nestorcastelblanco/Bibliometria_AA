abstract = {Propelled by their remarkable capabilities to generate novel and engaging content, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies are disrupting traditional workflows in many industries. While prior research has examined GenAI from a techno-centric perspective, there is still a lack of understanding about how users perceive and utilize GenAI in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with (N = 18) GenAI users in creative industries, investigating the human-GenAI co-creation process within a holistic LUA (Learning, Using and Assessing) framework. Our study uncovered an intriguingly complex landscape: Prospects – GenAI greatly fosters the co-creation between human expertise and GenAI capabilities, profoundly transforming creative workflows; Challenges – Meanwhile, users face substantial uncertainties and complexities arising from resource availability, tool usability, and regulatory compliance; Strategies – In response, users actively devise various strategies to overcome many of such challenges. Our study reveals key implications for the design of future GenAI tools.},

abstract = {This study explores the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), in particular, ChatGPT, on the public sector workforce in the United States, focusing on task replacement, assistance potential, and the evolving landscape of skills. Utilizing GPT-4 to evaluate 1,022 core tasks across 51 public sector occupations, we provide an exploratory analysis of the roles susceptible to ChatGPT automation and those in which ChatGPT can augment human efforts. Our findings reveal that while 63\% of tasks are resistant to ChatGPT replacement, primarily due to their requirement for physical presence, emotional intelligence, and complex decision-making, tasks that are routine, rule-based, and involving basic content generation show a high potential for automation. The study also identifies key skills that will remain vital, those likely to become obsolete, and new skills that will emerge as essential, highlighting the need for a strategic approach to workforce development in the face of AI advancements. In particular, our findings underscore the growing importance of skills in applying AI technologies and the ability to validate and interpret AI-generated content for humans to remain competitive. We offer insights into public-sector-specific impacts and propose a methodological framework for future research, emphasizing the importance of adapting educational curricula and policies to prepare for an AI-integrated future.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has significantly increased the sophistication and ease of image tampering techniques, posing challenges for digital forensics in identifying manipulated images. A lack of dataset standardisation hinders the ability to effectively benchmark and compare GenAI inpainting localisation techniques, reducing their reliability in digital forensic applications. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring the need for standardised criteria for datasets in digital forensics for benchmarking detection techniques through preliminary experiments.To address the limited diversity in existing datasets, a small-scale dataset was developed, consisting of 240 tampered images, 20 masks and 20 authentic images. This dataset includes four subject image classes (animals, objects, persons, scenery) and three inpainting tools (GLIDE, GalaxyAI, Photoshop). The dataset was evaluated against 13 localisation algorithms from the Image Forensics MATLAB Toolbox to determine key components that should be considered in the standardisation of testing environments.The results show that the images in the animals and persons categories achieved the highest F1-Scores and accuracy over the other classes. Among tools, GLIDE inpainted images were consistently shown to be the most challenging to detect, underscoring the importance of further investigating these images. These findings provide foundational insights for identifying a set of criteria to establish robust testing environments, enabling the development of reliable and accurate GenAI inpainting localisation techniques.},

From our experience in CS50, Harvard University's introductory course, we've seen firsthand the impactful role that generative artificial intelligence can play in education. Recognizing its potential and stakes, we integrated OpenAI's GPT into our own teaching methodology. The goal was to emulate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio, incorporating "pedagogical guardrails" to maintain instructional integrity. The result was a personalized, AI-powered bot in the form of a friendly rubber duck aimed at delivering instructional responses and troubleshooting without giving outright solutions. We plan to share our journey and offer insights into responsibly harnessing AI in educational settings. Participants will gain hands-on experience working with GPT through OpenAI's APIs, understanding and crafting prompts, answering questions using embedding-based search, and finally, building their own AI chatbot. Ultimately, we'll not only share lessons learned from our own approach but also equip educators hands-on with the knowledge and tools with which they, too, can implement these technologies in their unique teaching environments.},

Despite their similarities, the most effective representation methods for these steps differ, leading to inefficiencies, limited representativeness, and reduced interpretability. In this paper, we introduce KGGLM, a decoder-only Transformer model designed for generalizable knowledge representation learning to support recommendation. The model is trained on generic paths sampled from the knowledge graph to capture foundational patterns, and then fine-tuned on paths specific of the downstream step (knowledge completion and path reasoning in our case). Experiments on ML1M and LFM1M show that KGGLM beats twenty-two baselines in effectiveness under both knowledge completion and recommendation.

abstract = {Engineering process management aims to formally specify processes which are executable, measurable, and controllable. Common representations include text-based domain-specific languages (DSLs) or graphical notations such as the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN). The specification itself can be seen as a Software Product Line (SPL), building upon concepts such as tasks, UI forms, fields and actions. Domain experts provide requirements for processes but often lack the technical programming skills to formalize them in a process specification language. We present an interactive SPL application prototype that allows domain experts to model simple processes in natural language. Our framework for the reliable generation of formal specifications with Large Language Models (LLMs) supports the machine-translation from natural language to a JSON-based process DSL. In this case study, five domain experts were asked to model any process of their choice through natural-language interactions. As a result, the user interface corresponding to the process DSL was shown as immediate feedback. We documented their perceived translation quality and interviewed them on their impressions of this methodology. An average user-assessed performance rating of 68\% was achieved. Even though the modelling strategies differed greatly between individuals, the tool was able to adequately capture the majority of instructions, leaving an overall positive impression on the participants. More context awareness and additional conventional interaction elements were the main aspects found to be improved for a productive implementation.},

abstract = {Addressing the volatility of renewable energies like solar and wind is crucial for the energy system’s stability and optimal utilization of renewable energies. Accurate energy forecasts are important to improve scheduling. Electrical demand and renewable energies are weather-dependent and Numerical Weather Predictions have proven to be beneficial for energy forecasts due to their fine-grained spatial resolution. State-of-the-art Deep Learning approaches for energy forecasting are black-box models. However, decisions in energy systems depend on energy forecasts, and, thus, it is important that models are explainable and trustworthy. Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques exist that add explainability to energy forecasting models, but all existing methods are only post-hoc or do not use weather data on large spatial areas. This paper introduces a novel approach to forecast energy that scales and adds intrinsic explainability by design. Therefore, we use trainable spatial weights to make accurate forecasts on large spatial areas. The trained weights can be interpreted spatially to enhance explainability and increase trust. Furthermore, the spatial weights enable a wide range of future work, including postprocessing, subregion forecasting, hierarchical learning, and spatial-temporal weights.},

We argue that metacognition—the psychological ability to monitor and control one’s thoughts and behavior—offers a valuable lens to understand and design for these usability challenges. Drawing on research in psychology and cognitive science, and recent GenAI user studies, we illustrate how GenAI systems impose metacognitive demands on users, requiring a high degree of metacognitive monitoring and control. We propose these demands could be addressed by integrating metacognitive support strategies into GenAI systems, and by designing GenAI systems to reduce their metacognitive demand by targeting explainability and customizability. Metacognition offers a coherent framework for understanding the usability challenges posed by GenAI, and provides novel research and design directions to advance human-AI interaction.},

The research results indicate that research in the field of artificial intelligence ethics has begun to take shape, but  the density of networks  is relatively low, and the connections between different research topics are not close enough. Current research mainly focuses on ethical considerations at the algorithmic and technical levels, as well as their potential impact on the moral framework of human society. The research results lack innovation and tend to be repetitive. The ethical research on artificial intelligence has formed four relatively stable subgroups, reflecting the diverse paths of ethical governance in artificial intelligence and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration.

abstract = {Distributed Collaborative Machine Learning (DCML) has emerged in artificial intelligence-empowered edge computing environments, such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), to process tremendous data generated by smart devices. However, parallel DCML frameworks require resource-constrained devices to update the entire Deep Neural Network (DNN) models and are vulnerable to reconstruction attacks. Concurrently, the serial DCML frameworks suffer from training efficiency problems due to their serial training nature. In this paper, we propose a Model Pruning-enabled Federated Split Learning framework (MP-FSL) to reduce resource consumption with a secure and efficient training scheme. Specifically, MP-FSL compresses DNN models by adaptive channel pruning and splits each compressed model into two parts that are assigned to the client and the server. Meanwhile, MP-FSL adopts a novel aggregation algorithm to aggregate the pruned heterogeneous models. We implement MP-FSL with a real FL platform to evaluate its performance. The experimental results show that MP-FSL outperforms the state-of-the-art frameworks in model accuracy by up to 1.35\%, while concurrently reducing storage and computational resource consumption by up to 32.2\% and 26.73\%, respectively. These results demonstrate that MP-FSL is a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by DCML, with superior performance in both reduced resource consumption and enhanced model performance.},

Thus, to fill this gap, we performed a systematic literature review of these methods. In this review, we apply a methodology proposed in the literature that locates existing studies, selects and evaluates contributions, analyses, and synthesizes data. We used Google Scholar and databases such as Elsevier's Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. A set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to select documents. The results showed that when AI methods are used in VR applications, the main advantages are high efficiency and precision of algorithms. Moreover, we observe that machine learning is the most applied AI scientific technique in VR applications. In conclusion, this paper showed that the combination of AI and VR contributes to new trends, opportunities, and applications for human-machine interactive devices, education, agriculture, transport, 3D image reconstruction, and health. We also concluded that the usage of AI in VR provides potential benefits in other fields of the real world such as teleconferencing, emotion interaction, tourist services, and image data extraction.},

The information age requires that primary school English teaching should strengthen the use of multimedia resources and gradually realize the diversification of teaching content. Expanded reality innovation is a sort of mixture picture handling innovation, which is one of the significant innovations that would influence the improvement of fundamental schooling in the following five years. It can seamlessly output virtual objects to the real environment, which is convenient for this paper to obtain and absorb information. It can also help students to participate in exploration and cultivate their creativity and imagination. It can strengthen the cooperation between students and teachers and create various learning environments. It has an immeasurable prospect of development in the field of education. The primary school English teaching resources based on augmented reality create a realistic learning situation from two-dimensional plane to three-dimensional three-dimensional display, and enrich the presentation of primary school English teaching content. It can stimulate students’ interest in learning English and promote the transformation of English teaching methods. It is a useful attempt in the field of education. This paper made statistics on the test results of the experimental class and the control class. Most of the scores of the experimental group were between 71 and 100, a total of 27, accounting for 67.5\%. The score distribution of the control class was relatively balanced, with the highest number between 61-70, and the number was 10, accounting for 25\%.

abstract = {This paper presents a visionary perspective on developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in the field of human mobility research. Human mobility profoundly influences our daily lives, impacting transportation systems, urban planning, logistics, and healthcare. While AI methods have made significant advancements in addressing human mobility challenges, they often struggle with the complexity and dynamic nature of this domain. The limitations arise from the narrow focus of existing AI systems, lacking the ability to generalize and adapt to new situations. To overcome these limitations, there is a growing interest in developing AGI systems. This paper explores the potential of AGI to revolutionize human mobility research by enabling systems to understand, learn, reason, and adapt across diverse domains and tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose the Mobility Foundation Model (MFM) and the concept of an intermediate modality is further introduced as a means to bridge the gap between different mobility modalities and scales. The unified representation allows the MFM to effectively learn and integrate information from various modalities. We also present a novel MFM as Administrator paradigm for leveraging MFM in complex mobility tasks. We hope that this paper will provide novel insights and open new directions in human mobility research.},

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) may reshape how participatory design is conducted. To explore the emerging implications of supporting stakeholders with AI, we conducted a systematic review (n = 14) of empirical studies. The literature suggests that AI can improve the accessibility and quality of participatory design by lowering the participatory threshold, and facilitating process execution, collaboration, and creation. Stakeholders’ use of AI also poses risks of relying on biased models, causing cognitive overload, and leading stakeholders to uncritically fixate on AI input, potentially diminishing the quality of design outcomes. Based on these findings, we explore the evolving role of AI in participatory design—and call for future research on its fallibility, participatory nature, and potential for exacerbating stakeholder vulnerabilities. Herewith, this review contributes to our understanding of how AI can support stakeholders in participatory design.},

abstract = {Generative AI technologies are increasingly being incorporated into creativity support tools. However, most generative AI tools rely on text-based prompting, requiring users to translate visual ideas into linguistic descriptions. This approach is misaligned with the sketch-driven workflows of creative professionals. To address this gap, we introduce SketchAI, a novel sketch-first interface for diffusion models that allows practitioners to use real-time sketching on a tablet computer to guide model outputs. Through a qualitative study with 29 fashion design apprentices, we explored the interface’s potential impacts on creative workflows. While some participants identified use cases where SketchAI streamlined routine tasks, others expressed concerns about its potential to undermine creative agency and exploration. These findings unearthed hidden complexity: while generative AI can support some aspects of creativity, its core capabilities may challenge the central identity of creative practitioners. While SketchAI does not resolve this problem, it does take a meaningful step towards reconciliation.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the practical application and effect verification of intelligent technology in the digital transformation of university teaching. With the rapid development of information technology, traditional university courses have gradually shown certain shortcomings in content presentation and teaching interaction. Existing studies use more algorithms such as machine learning to improve classroom efficiency and students' learning experience. To this end, we proposed a set of digital transformation strategies for university courses and verified them through empirical research. The study selected two university courses, “Advanced Mathematics” and “Crawler Technology”, and adopted the integration model of “technology-assisted + traditional teaching” to carry out teaching reform. The purpose is to explore the specific situation of new tools in enriching course content, expanding knowledge coverage, improving learning outcomes, improving student satisfaction, and stimulating online learning activity. We also introduced relevant technologies such as natural language processing and data mining to construct a quantitative evaluation index system. By setting up an experimental group and a control group, a comparative analysis was conducted through data such as students' academic performance, platform usage records, and course feedback. The results show that the course content has become more layered after integrating new technologies, and students' learning performance has improved significantly, with satisfaction increasing from 70\% to 91\%, academic performance improving by an average of about 15\%, and online learning participation increasing by 20\%. These data verify the positive role of intelligent means in course optimization from multiple dimensions.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence(AI) technology applications, new development opportunities have been brought to many very important fields, such as medical services, finance, education and teaching, transportation, energy development, etc., and it also brings new development opportunities to human society and brings more convenience. At the same time, in recent years, with the continuous improvement of living standards, more and more people choose to travel by air transportation with fast speed and good service. In addition, the number of airlines continues to increase and the high-speed railway network is also constantly developing. How airlines should reflect their advantages in the fierce market competition requires continuous improvement of the quality and level of aviation services. This article mainly adopts experimental analysis method and questionnaire survey method to explore the application of AI technology in aviation intelligent service. This paper investigates and analyzes the application function verification of intelligent service robots and the services that passengers of different ages hope to improve civil aviation. According to the experimental survey results, the accuracy of functions such as voice recognition, human body recognition, and business window guidance of intelligent service robots is high in the verification environment, and most passengers hope to solve the problem of walking distance.},

This article examines the socio-technical and legal perspectives of transparency in relation to algorithmic decision-making in public administration. We show how transparency in AI can be understood in light of the various technologies and the challenges one may encounter. Despite some first steps in that direction, there exists so far no mature standard for documenting AI models. From a legal perspective, this article examined the applicable freedom of information (FOI) regimes across different jurisdictions, with a particular focus on Denmark and other Scandinavian countries. Despite notable differences, our findings show that the FOI regimes generally only grant access to existing documents, and that access can be denied on the basis of the wide proprietary interests and internal documents exemptions. This is why we ultimately conclude that the European data-protection framework and the proposed EU AI Act — with their far-reaching duties to document the functioning of AI systems — provide promising new avenues for research and insights into transparency in AI.},

abstract = {We introduce ToonCrafter, a novel approach that transcends traditional correspondence-based cartoon video interpolation, paving the way for generative interpolation. Traditional methods, that implicitly assume linear motion and the absence of complicated phenomena like dis-occlusion, often struggle with the exaggerated non-linear and large motions with occlusion commonly found in cartoons, resulting in implausible or even failed interpolation results. To overcome these limitations, we explore the potential of adapting live-action video priors to better suit cartoon interpolation within a generative framework. ToonCrafter effectively addresses the challenges faced when applying live-action video motion priors to generative cartoon interpolation. First, we design a toon rectification learning strategy that seamlessly adapts live-action video priors to the cartoon domain, resolving the domain gap and content leakage issues. Next, we introduce a dual-reference-based 3D decoder to compensate for lost details due to the highly compressed latent prior spaces, ensuring the preservation of fine details in interpolation results. Finally, we design a flexible sketch encoder that empowers users with interactive control over the interpolation results. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method not only produces visually convincing and more natural dynamics, but also effectively handles dis-occlusion. The comparative evaluation demonstrates the notable superiority of our approach over existing competitors. Code and model weights are available at https://doubiiu.github.io/projects/ToonCrafter},

Specifically, it investigates the impact of human capital improvement, general artificial intelligence, and average IQ scores on total reserves. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between various independent variables and the dependent variable, total reserve. The data was analyzed using a multiple regression model in Stata. The results indicated that poverty and GARI were not significant predictors of total reserve. However, there was a significant negative relationship between HCI and total reserve, as well as a significant negative relationship between GAI and total reserve. Additionally, there was a marginally significant positive relationship between IQ and total reserve, and a marginally significant negative relationship between GII and total reserve. The coefficient for GDP per capita was also negative, but not statistically significant. These findings suggest that at least some of the independent variables have a significant relationship with total reserve, supporting the alternative hypothesis. Further research is needed to explore the direction and magnitude of these relationships. The analysis uses a linear robust regression model to account for potential outliers and influential observations. The results show that only HCI and GAI are statistically significant predictors of total reserves, while the relationship between IQ and total reserves is weaker. The findings suggest that policymakers should focus on improving human capital and harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence to promote socioeconomic development.},

This paper presents a study of teenagers’ everyday understanding of AI/ML technologies. Using a thematic analysis of the teenagers’ own explanations during a series of workshops, we present a conceptual map of the teenagers’ understandings of these technologies. We go on to propose five general recommendations for the teaching of AI/ML to teenagers through the lens of Computational Empowerment. Taken together, these recommendations serve as a teenage-centered starting point for teaching young people about intelligent technologies, an approach that can be implemented in future research interventions with similar objectives.},

abstract = {Generative AI is revolutionizing content creation and has the potential to enable real-time, personalized educational experiences. We investigated the effectiveness of converting textbook chapters into AI-generated podcasts and explored the impact of personalizing these podcasts for individual learner profiles. We conducted a 3x3 user study with 180 college students in the United States, comparing traditional textbook reading with both generalized and personalized AI-generated podcasts across three textbook subjects. The personalized podcasts were tailored to students’ majors, interests, and self-described instructional preferences. Our findings show that students found the AI-generated podcast format to be more enjoyable than textbooks and that personalized podcasts led to significantly improved learning outcomes, although this was subject-specific. These results highlight that AI-generated podcasts can offer an engaging and effective modality transformation of textbook material, with personalization enhancing content relevance. We conclude with design recommendations for leveraging AI in education, informed by student feedback.},

abstract = {Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) is an emerging simulation paradigm that combines the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models with traditional Agent-Based Modeling to replicate complex social behaviors, including interactions on social media. While prior work has focused on localized phenomena such as opinion formation and information spread, its potential to capture global network dynamics remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing GABM-based social media simulations through the lens of the Friendship Paradox (FP), a counterintuitive phenomenon where individuals, on average, have fewer friends than their friends. We propose a GABM framework for social media simulations, featuring generative agents that emulate real users with distinct personalities and interests. Using Twitter datasets on the US 2020 Election and the QAnon conspiracy, we show that the FP emerges naturally in GABM simulations. Consistent with real-world observations, the simulations unveil a hierarchical structure, where agents preferentially connect with others displaying higher activity or influence. Additionally, we find that infrequent connections primarily drive the FP, reflecting patterns in real networks. These findings validate GABM as a robust tool for modeling global social media phenomena and highlight its potential for advancing social science by enabling nuanced analysis of user behavior.},

Despite the advantages of this trend, it is believed that AI-powered tools should be utilized to enhance the literature review process rather than completely automating it. For this reason, this paper examines the emerging concept of "Literature Review as a Service" (LRaaS) based on the human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) perspective. Drawing on the theoretical background and service science, the paper explores a new approach to exploit the potential of AI-powered tools while putting people at the center of the research process.

abstract = {In recent years, with the development of the Internet, APT malware detection remains an important issue for society. The lengthy nature of API sequence text leads to polysemy issues with distant repeated words. Traditional deep learning models must improve extracting the long-term dependencies of entire API sequences. During an APT attack, attackers combine benign and malicious sequences to conceal their malicious intent, resulting in localized malignancy. In response to these issues, the paper proposes A BERT-Transformer-TextCNN model for attack detection. BERT encodes API sequences, addressing the polysemy issue of distant repeated words. The Transformer-encoder extracts long-term dependencies, resolving the global feature issues of long sequences, and TextCNN is applied to capture local sequence information to solve the problem of localized malignancy. Based on actual APT malware samples, BERT encoding achieves higher precision than traditional encoders. Employing a Transformer-Encoder to extract long-term dependencies yields higher precision than using BiLSTM to extract long-term relationships. When adding features related to local feature correlation, the precision increased by 3.39\%.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of science and technology, system security is facing an increasing number of threats, among which system vulnerabilities have brought serious challenges to information security. In such an environment, system logs, as key data that record the operating status of computer systems, user operations and various events, play an extremely important role in monitoring system health and quickly locating and resolving system failures. However, the current accuracy of log parsing is not high enough to meet the actual demand; the parsing process is inefficient and difficult to adapt to the processing requirements of large data log files. Aiming at the problems of insufficient accuracy of log parsing and low efficiency of parsing process, a log parsing method AT-parser (Log parser based on word attributes and parse trees) is proposed. Through the log preprocessing, the log content used in the subsequent construction of log templates can be separated, the log content combined with word attribute filtering, retaining the key words, constructing a string set through the key words, and then performing similarity clustering based on the string set to classify the log strings into different log groups. Finally, the final template sequence is generated by constructing a parse tree, which improves the accuracy and speeds up the parsing efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness of AT-Parser is verified by experiments on public datasets.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of 5G and mobile internet, various application fields continue to generate diverse dynamic streaming graphs with large scales and complex structures. Analyzing, querying and mining such a streaming graph face great challenges. To address the challenge of low query efficiency and avoid data loss, this paper proposes a two-stage coarsening method that preserves key features of a streaming graph while improves query efficiency. In the initial stage, the size of the streaming graph is not that large yet. To preserve its structure and attributes as much as possible, a linear mapping method is used for graph coarsening. As the size of the streaming graph increases, a graph neural network model based on cluster pooling is constructed in the second stage. Using a large number of graph coarsening results obtained in the initial stage to train and optimize this model. Then, we use this optimized model to obtain the subsequent summaries, which achieves online efficient graph coarsening. Finally, extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm significantly improves the quality of streaming graph coarsening compared to traditional algorithms. Even compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm Auxo, our algorithm shows a better performance on preserving key features.},

At the same time, AI is increasingly incorporated into government functions and the public sector. We propose that governments and the public sector can set an example for the responsible use of AI technologies by following the principles of algorithmic governance traditionally recommended to the private sector. Algorithmic governance has traditionally been defined in the literature as governance by algorithms, or how artificial intelligence is used to make governance decisions and affect social ordering. However, we take an alternative approach; instead, we conceptualize algorithmic governance as the governance of algorithms. We begin by summarizing the risks of generative AI use in government, then outline algorithmic governance principles, a step-by-step approach to implementing algorithmic governance into government or public sector projects, opportunities for inter-sector collaboration, and final conclusions.},

Given the widespread use of this tool and the lack of knowledge over how it can support learning, there is a need for educators to have a framework for using it in the classroom and teaching their students usage strategies that are beneficial for learning. One pathway forward is through creativity, a process crucial for learning and also connected to the act of using gen-AI. This poster demonstrates the results of a study designed to provide an in-depth view on how creativity intersects with gen-AI usage in a computational physics course. In the course, students learn about computing tools during group-based, open-ended computational physics activities. Students are often tasked with using gen-AI to explore and help make decisions. The findings demonstrate a connection between using gen-AI and engaging in creative processes, and the implications point to strategies for supporting student usage of gen-AI.},
