abstract = {A method of using AI for news production was studied in response to the usage of Chat GPT in the AIGC model: applying Chat GPT technology to the AIGC model. The article first elaborates on some basic knowledge and explains its role in news reporting. Secondly, the introduction of artificial intelligence technology into the digital news production process was discussed preliminarily. The "New 4C Rule" is a fundamental principle in the context of artificial intelligence, which takes appropriate contexts as the starting point, specific communities as the guidance, high-quality content as the core, and links around characters, content, and brands. In this situation, cultivating a positive sense of responsibility among media platforms and improving the media quality of audiences have important practical significance for building a new intelligent news production pattern.},

abstract = {As DDoS attack patterns become increasingly varied and challenging to detect with the advancement of the field, this paper aims to explore the possibilities of applying machine learning algorithms for the defense and detection of DDoS attacks. We selected papers published since 2000 concerning the aforementioned applications, investigated the algorithms described therein, and compared their data performance in the testing sections to explore the advantages and disadvantages. Our findings reveal that SVM exhibits excellent performance in detecting attack traffic, whereas decision trees and their enhanced versions are less prominent. Additionally, genetic algorithms are not suitable for attack traffic detection but excel in filtering irrelevant traffic features. These insights hold significant implications for both real-world applications in enhancing cybersecurity measures and theoretical contributions by laying groundwork for future research in the rapidly evolving domain of DDoS attack mitigation. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive overview of the landscape of machine learning in DDoS defense, providing valuable insights and directions for future investigations.},

abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) supports early detection of learning difficulties by predicting student performance. However, machine learning models often operate as black boxes. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) helps to explain why black-box models produce specific predictions. This paper systematically reviews the past five years of research on XAI applications for interpreting student performance prediction in Computer Science and STEM education. We found that behavioral and academic performance data were the most commonly used features, with the main prediction goals focused on course failure risk or grades. This study also examined the application areas of XAI, revealing that the most common uses were global feature importance analysis, individual prediction explanations, and supporting interventions and decision-making. Moreover, we found that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were the most frequently utilized XAI technique, predominantly applied at the global level, with limited use at the individual level. Furthermore, a research gap was identified in utilizing XAI to support course improvements, customize visualizations, and generate personalized recommendations. Addressing this gap could enable educators to provide personalized, data-driven guidance to better support individual students.},

A questionnaire survey was conducted on 300 individuals in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and other cities, and quantitative technology was used to conduct data statistics and inspections on the access to artificial intelligence of various social classes. High-income groups clearly occupy an advantageous position in the access and application of artificial intelligence technology. Their access frequency, application depth and technology dependence are far greater than those of low-income groups. Data analysis shows that there are significant differences in the adoption and application of artificial intelligence technology among social classes. Groups with weak economic foundations face the difficulties of lack of education and resources, and face a large technical threshold for technology access. They are at a disadvantage in the application of technology.},

abstract = {The increasing complexity of AI systems has led to the growth of the field of Explainable AI (XAI), which aims to provide explanations and justifications for the outputs of AI algorithms. While there is considerable demand for XAI, there remains a scarcity of studies aimed at comprehensively understanding the practical distinctions among different methods and effectively aligning each method with users’ individual needs, and ideally, offer a mapping function which can map each user with its specific needs to a method of explainability. This study endeavors to bridge this gap by conducting a review of the relevant works in XAI, with a specific focus on Explainable Machine Learning (XML), and a keen eye on user needs to provide an observational study. Our main objective is to offer a classification of XAI methods within the realm of XML, categorizing current works into three distinct domains: philosophy, theory, and practice. Moreover, our study seeks to facilitate the connection between XAI users and the most suitable methods for them and tailor explanations to meet their specific needs by proposing a mapping function that take to account users and their desired properties and suggest an XAI method to them. This entails an examination of prevalent XAI approaches and an evaluation of their properties. The primary outcome of this study is the formulation of a clear and concise strategy for selecting the optimal XAI method to achieve a given goal, all while delivering personalized explanations tailored to individual users.},

abstract = {Integrating AI into blockchain consensus, such as Proof-of-Learning and Proof of Useful Work, necessitates AI enablers. However, current consensus protocols cannot ensure AI enabler quality, crucial for AI-powered distributed blockchain and federated learning. Traditional consensus middleware between network and application layers proves inadequate for AI-focused blockchain and federated learning. Thus, an AI-driven application-level consensus with quality-assured enablers is imperative.We propose Proof-of-INtelligence (PIN), an application-level consensus for AI-based blockchain and federated learning, ensuring AI enabler quality. To the best of our knowledge, PIN pioneers the first AI-centric application-level consensus for distributed environments. Employing enablers like accuracy and training quality, PIN is showcased in the federated learning setup “PIN in BlOckchAin-based fedeRateD learning (PIN-BOARD),” the first AI-specific consensus application in blockchain-based federated learning. Both PIN and PIN-BOARD are the highlights of our contributions to the presented work and emphasize the novelty. PIN is the first AI-centric application-level consensus for blockchain and pioneers decentralized AI assurance; PIN addresses the limitations of existing consensus protocols and advances blockchain-based federated learning through the novel framework called PIN-BOARD. Experimental evaluation involves PIN’s accuracy, confirmation time, and a new AI-assurance factor metric. PIN-BOARD’s assessment includes testing accuracy and reward accuracy. A thorough security analysis ensures the strength of PIN and PIN-BOARD. The comparative evaluation highlights PIN’s 20\% throughput enhancement and efficient artificial index. PIN-BOARD reduces epochs by 28.5\% for peak federated learning accuracy as compared to existing federated models. Thus, PIN emerges as an efficient AI-driven application-level consensus with AI assurance.},

Value-sensitive design (VSD) is a human-centered and theory-grounded approach to technology design that explicitly elicits and accounts for human values. However, there is scant concrete guidance on how to involve students in co-designing LA technologies from a VSD perspective, in an efficient manner. This paper presents a novel method, called VALA/AID, to elicit student values, challenges and motivations, in the early stages of an LA design process. We briefly illustrate the application of the method and the kind of evidence and design insights that can be distilled from it, for a relatively under-explored context in LA research: doctoral education.},

By comparing machine-generated scores with human scores and implementing a designed screening strategy, we ultimately identified samples that require re-evaluation by expert graders for final scoring. This method only requires a small amount of human scoring to train the model. Experiments on real data demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively identifies responses that need re-evaluation, thereby improving the overall grading quality.},

However, practical obstacles remain, such as time constraints and students’ passive participation and the low quality of peer feedback. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been explored for its potential to automate grading and provide timely feedback, making it a valuable tool in formative assessment. Nevertheless, there is still limited research on how AI can be used effectively in the context of formative peer assessment. In this study, we conducted an AI-driven formative peer assessment with 108 secondary school students. During the peer assessment process, students not only evaluated peers’ responses and received peer-generated feedback, but also evaluated AI-generated responses and received AI-generated feedback. This research focused on analyzing the differences in preference between AI-generated and peer-generated feedback using trace data and dispositional data. In scenarios where student participation was low or the quality of peer feedback was insufficient, students showed a higher preference for AI-generated feedback, demonstrating its potential utility. However, students with high Math Confidence and AI Interest preferred peer-generated feedback. Based on these findings, we will propose practical strategies for implementing AI-driven formative peer assessment.},

abstract = {With the advancement of technology iteration, the trend of industrial automation is becoming more and more prominent, and the era of Industry 4.0, which is dominated by intelligent manufacturing, is coming. The industrial internet is booming. However, due to the increasing complexity of the network environment and various types of cyber attacks, there are huge challenges for the industrial internet. Traditional network security devices adopt isolated protection measures and cannot achieve information sharing, which can only reflect the security of the network from one side. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the current security status of the industrial internet and a prediction of its safety development trend over a certain period are the important directions for the development of industrial internet security. In response to the above issues, this paper proposes to improve the traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and combine it with Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) to carry out security situation risk assessment. To provide network managers with more valuable network security situation information.},

Current trends in digital play research focus on the effect of learning tools (i.e. video games and intelligence robots) on children's development and/or learning skills. This paper reports on the work in progress of exploring children's interaction with artificially intelligence toys and robots and their potential contribution to children´s learning journey. Furthermore, this study examines how these technologies facilitate the interactive learning process in educational settings. In the first stage, the project aims to build a conceptual framework for children's digital play and digital games-based learning experiences with these devices. In the second stage, the study of the AI features of toys and robots that potentially improve learning experiences is conducted through a content analysis – a specific instrument is developed to examine AI features. The final stage will involve performing a field study on child-robot interaction in a natural setting – a technique of gesture and movement analysis is employed for the recorded video of child-robot interaction.},

abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) simplify complex learner data into accessible visualisations, providing actionable insights for educators and students. However, their educational effectiveness has not always matched the sophistication of the technology behind them. Explanatory and interactive LADs, enhanced by generative AI (GenAI) chatbots, hold promise by enabling dynamic, dialogue-based interactions with data visualisations and offering personalised feedback through text. Yet, the effectiveness of these tools may be limited by learners’ varying levels of GenAI literacy, a factor that remains underexplored in current research. This study investigates the role of GenAI literacy in learner interactions with conventional (reactive) versus scaffolding (proactive) chatbot-assisted LADs. Through a comparative analysis of 81 participants, we examine how GenAI literacy is associated with learners’ ability to interpret complex visualisations and their cognitive processes during interactions with chatbot-assisted LADs. Results show that while both chatbots significantly improved learner comprehension, those with higher GenAI literacy benefited the most, particularly with conventional chatbots, demonstrating diverse prompting strategies. Findings highlight the importance of considering learners’ GenAI literacy when integrating GenAI chatbots in LADs and educational technologies. Incorporating scaffolding techniques within GenAI chatbots can be an effective strategy, offering a more guided experience that reduces reliance on learners’ GenAI literacy.},

In order to reduce China's dependence on traditional mineral energy, some achievements have been made in increasing research and development efforts in new energy. With the continuous increase in the scale of new energy grid connection, the proportion of new energy grid connection is constantly increasing, and problems such as grid stability and power quality degradation are becoming increasingly prominent, which directly affects the widespread application of new energy generation technology. This article explored the research on a remote control system for new energy grid connected power generation based on artificial intelligence. Taking the island detection of photovoltaic grid connected inverters based on Adaboost algorithm as an example, the feasibility of the technology was verified through experiments. The experimental data showed that the accuracy, recall, and F0.5 of island effect prediction based on Adaboost algorithm were 0.98, 0.9523, and 0.7811, respectively, which were higher than other algorithms.},

abstract = {The deep learning model LSTM (Long Short - Term Memory) can be used to deal with the problem of sequences, and is currently the most commonly used model to deal with music training. The process of LSTM training is sequence-to-sequence, which allows the back-and-forth relationship of notes in an instrument to be learnt by the model; however, when dealing with multiple instruments, there are multiple sequences that need to be processed at the same time, which is a limitation of the LSTM model architecture, which makes most of the current automated composition systems for single instrument training and output. However, when dealing with multiple instruments, there are multiple sequences that need to be processed at the same time, which is a limitation of the LSTM model architecture, and this makes most of the current automated composers train and output for a single instrument. Currently it is visible to deal with LSTM multiple sequences problem. Whereas this study needs to achieve multiple sound event sequence inputs corresponding to multiple sequence outputs, and the sequences are connected to each other, a problem for which there is no effective solution at present. This study attempts to choose to use Deep Improvisation (Tatsuya, 2017) for improvement by training a single track and optimizing and modifying the system to be able to have two tracks of input and two tracks of output to achieve a more resilient system, which in turn creates more realistic music. Due to the above background, the motivation to improve the deep learning automatic songwriting system arises with the expectation that the research in this paper will improve the system to be able to produce multi-tracked and more realistic music, so that more researchers will be able to apply the system to be able to produce songs and apply them to a variety of contexts at a small cost.},

abstract = {In the field of data privacy protection, data access is restricted by setting access privileges and authentication mechanisms. However, when data usage scenarios or access requirements change, the privilege settings need to be adjusted frequently, resulting in complex and inefficient management. Especially when dealing with large-scale distributed data, traditional methods are difficult to efficiently screen and eliminate malicious behavior clients, which further aggravates the risk of privacy leakage. Therefore, we study the optimization of data privacy protection algorithm based on distributed artificial intelligence technology. The key feature information is extracted to reflect the essential attributes of the data, in order to simplify the form of data representation. The federal learning algorithm in distributed artificial intelligence technology is used for data protection to efficiently screen and eliminate potential malicious clients. On this basis, we add appropriate amount of noise to the query process to protect the data from being leaked, and at the same time, dynamically adjust the data privacy protection algorithm and update the protection scheme in real time to cope with the changing nature of the data and its intrinsic relevance. The experimental results show that the optimization method of data privacy protection algorithm based on distributed artificial intelligence technology is significantly better than other comparative methods in reducing the possibility of privacy leakage, improving privacy protection efficiency, and reducing data loss rate. Moreover, the security and reliability of privacy data is as high as 90\%, fully verifying the superiority of the proposed method. The results indicate that this method provides an efficient, stable, and secure technical means for data privacy protection.},

While many learning systems already address this issue, they typically lack automation and scalability in teaching novices and, thus, hinder the learning processes within organizations.

This work explores the potential of using (X)AI-based learning systems for providing learning examples and explanations to novices. In an exploratory study, we evaluate novices’ learning performance in a learning setting taking into account their cognitive abilities.

These results offer practical and theoretical support for teaching according to students' aptitude and effectively promote the deep integration and reform of artificial intelligence with design teaching.

abstract = {Trustworthy artificial intelligence (Trusted AI) is of utmost importance when learning-enabled components (LECs) are used in autonomous, safety-critical systems. When reliant on deep learning, these systems need to address the reliability, robustness, and interpretability of learning models. In addition to developing strategies to address these concerns, appropriate software architectures are needed to coordinate LECs and ensure they deliver acceptable behavior even under uncertain conditions. This work describes Anunnaki, a model-driven framework comprising loosely-coupled modular services designed to monitor and manage LECs with respect to Trusted AI assurance concerns when faced with different sources of uncertainty. More specifically, the Anunnaki framework supports the composition of independent, modular services to assess and improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems. The design of Annunaki was guided by several key software engineering principles (e.g., modularity, composability, and reusability) in order to facilitate its use and maintenance to support different aggregate monitoring and assurance analysis tools for LESs and their respective data sets. We demonstrate Anunnaki on two autonomous platforms, a terrestrial rover, and an unmanned aerial vehicle. Our studies show how Anunnaki can be used to manage the operations of different autonomous learning-enabled systems with vision-based LECs while exposed to uncertain environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Deep forgery usually refers to the technique of multimedia forgery using deep learning. This technique if applied in illegal ways will threaten the security of individuals and society, in order to ensure the sustainable development of artificial intelligence technology and reduce its negative impact aspects, this study proposes an innovative detection model that aims to improve the accuracy of deep forgery content detection by combining the advantages of convolutional networks and capsule networks-BIGRU. The research methodology consists of first extracting spatial features of the image using a convolutional neural network (CNN), followed by capturing the positional information of the object using a capsule network, and capturing temporal features between video frames using a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The combined application of these techniques is extensively tested on multiple sample datasets. The experimental results show that the present model outperforms existing mainstream approaches in detecting deeply forged content, which not only proves the effectiveness of the model, but also demonstrates its potential in improving the security performance of AI. Ultimately, this study concludes that the accuracy of deep forgery detection can be significantly improved by comprehensively utilizing CNNs, capsule networks, and GRUs, which provides strong technical support for the healthy development of AI technology.},

abstract = {From the innovation, Artificial Intelligence (AI) materialized as one of the noticeable research areas in various technologies and has almost expanded into every aspect of modern human life. However, nowadays, the development of AI is unpredictable with the stated values of those developing them; hence, the risk of misbehaving AI increases continuously. Therefore, there are uncertainties about endorsing that the development and deploying of AI are favorable and not unfavorable to humankind. In addition, AI holds a black-box pattern, which results in a lack of understanding of how systems can work based on the raised concerns. From the above discussion, trustworthy AI is vital for the extensive adoption of AI in many applications, with strong attention to humankind and the need to focus on AI systems developing into the system outline at the time of system design. In this survey, we discuss compound materials on trustworthy AI and the present state-of-the-art of trustworthy AI technologies, revealing new perspectives, bridging knowledge gaps, and paving the way for potential advances of robustness, and explainability rules which play a proactive role in designing AI systems. Systems that are reliable and secure and mimic human behavior significantly impact the technological AI ecosystem. We provide various contemporary technologies to build explainability and robustness for AI-based solutions, so AI works in a safer and more trustworthy manner. Finally, we conclude our survey article with high-end opportunities, challenges, and future research directions for trustworthy AI to investigate in the future.},

abstract = {Against the backdrop of the rapid development of digital economy and artificial intelligence technology, performance appraisal and business-finance integration (BFI) have become key issues in improving enterprise management efficiency and scientific decision-making. Traditional performance appraisal methods often have problems such as single data dimension and subjective setting of appraisal indicators, making it difficult to effectively evaluate the synergy between finance and business. To this end, this paper proposes an intelligent performance evaluation method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) to improve the intelligence level of the appraisal system. The study uses conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to construct a performance evaluation framework, establishes a high-dimensional performance scoring model through the collaborative input of business data and financial data, and optimizes the rationality and accuracy of the scoring results under the adversarial training mechanism. Experiments show that compared with traditional linear regression models and decision tree models, the performance appraisal scoring error generated by GAN is reduced by 18.4\%, and the performance prediction accuracy is increased by 21.7\%. This method can effectively improve the scientific nature of enterprise performance appraisal, promote the in-depth development of business-finance integration, and provide theoretical support and practical guidance for enterprise intelligent management.},

We first describe how generative AI can be used to customize code through prompts and instructions, and further demonstrate its potential in building end-user tools for configuring code. We showcase how to transform an undocumented, technical, low-level TikZ into a user-friendly, configurable, Web-based customization tool written in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and itself configurable. We discuss how generative AI can support this transformation process and traditional variability engineering tasks, such as identification and implementation of features, synthesis of a template code generator, and development of end-user configurators. We believe it is a first step towards democratizing variability programming, opening a path for end-users to adapt code to their needs.},

abstract = {With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a powerful tool in the field of graphic design. However, balancing the trade-off between style diversity and sample quality remains a significant challenge. This study proposes a novel framework for generating and evaluating graphic design style diversity using conditional GANs (cGANs). By incorporating regularization strategies and style embedding mechanisms, the framework allows precise control over both the style and the diversity of generated samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively generates high-quality samples in both Retro and Minimalist styles. The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) scores of 22.5 for Retro and 28.7 for Minimalist, significantly lower than the baseline model's FID score of 34.2, indicate that the generated samples are visually closer to real data. Additionally, the Perceptual Path Length (PPL) score of 120.4 (compared to 178.7 for the baseline model) reflects smoother and more diverse distributions in the latent space. t-SNE visualizations further validate the broad coverage and clear separation of generated samples across different styles. This work provides a new paradigm for applying AI in the creative industry, with significant implications for the automation and diversification of graphic design.},

We analysed the current research on energy consumption of AI algorithms and its improvements, which gave us a starting literature corpus of 2,688 papers that we identified as Green AI with a software perspective. We structure this corpus into Green IN AI and Green BY AI, which led us to discover that only 36 of them could be considered Green IN AI. After some quick insights about Green BY AI, we then introduce our main contribution: a systematic mapping of Green IN AI. We provide an in-depth analysis of the AI models that we observed during the mapping, and what solutions have been proposed for improving their energy efficiency. We also analyse the energy evaluation methodologies employed in Green IN AI, discovering that most papers opt for a software-based energy estimation approach and 27\% of all papers do not document their methodology.

By simulating emotional states in response to external stimuli, the model aims to achieve emotional balance and stability, crucial for the mental well-being of athletes.

Since a USAR canine often works out of sight of the handler, the handler lacks awareness of the canine’s location and situation, known as the “sensemaking gap.” In this paper, we propose KHAIT, a novel approach to close the sensemaking gap and enhance USAR effectiveness by integrating object detection-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR). Equipped with AI-powered cameras, edge computing, and AR headsets, KHAIT enables precise and rapid object detection from a canine’s perspective, improving survivor localization. We evaluate this approach in a real-world USAR environment, demonstrating an average survival allocation time decrease of 22\%, enhancing the speed and accuracy of operations.},
