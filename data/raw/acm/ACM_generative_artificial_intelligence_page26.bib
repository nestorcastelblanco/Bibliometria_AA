abstract = {Lightweight block cipher TWINE, as a security protection for RFID, smart devices, etc. in artificial intelligence environments, its own security is very important. Analyzed the fault propagation law of lightweight block cipher TWINE and used differential fault analysis method to analyze TWINE. This method is based on the principle of half byte and half random fault attack, and deeply analyzes the degree of differential fault attack on TWINE through multiple rounds of fault propagation. The experimental results show that injecting a total of 4 faults in the 32nd round can fully recover the 80bit seed key, which is the best attack result so far against the differential fault attack of the TWINE algorithm.},

abstract = {Under the dual challenges of intelligent transformation and insufficient profitability of automobile manufacturing industry, the traditional financial control model is difficult to adapt to the dynamic market environment due to the problems of data silo and decision-making lag. Based on the framework of dynamic capability theory and the exploratory case of XX Automobile, this study adopts big data technology, machine learning algorithms, and combines blockchain, Internet of Things, database and other information technologies to systematically reveal the intrinsic mechanism of financial control innovation driven by the integration of industry finance and tax. The study found that: (1) Dynamic capabilities empower financial control innovation through the three phases of "sensing-capturing-reconstructing": Relying on big data technology to accurately identify the core drivers of ROE downturn, using machine learning models (decision tree, K-means clustering) to optimize the forecast of capital demand and supplier screening, and reorganizing the financial control innovation with the help of blockchain and distributed database (MongoDB), the study found that: (2) The dynamic ability of the financial management system is a key factor in financial management innovation. With the help of blockchain and distributed database (MongoDB), the company reconstructs the whole value chain process of procurement, cost and sales, and realizes the in-depth synergy of industry finance and tax data. (2) At the practical level, green bond financing reduces capital costs by 30\%, intelligent production line siting model significantly improves work efficiency and reduces carbon emissions by 117,300 tons, and RFM analysis and regression analysis accurately locate high-value customers and Belt and Road potential markets to promote export revenue growth. The conclusion of the study shows that dynamic capability theory provides an innovative path of "technology empowerment-decision optimization-strategic leap" for the integration of industry finance and tax, which not only verifies its theoretical applicability in the field of finance, but also provides a replicable practical paradigm for digital transformation of the automobile manufacturing industry, and at the same time contributes to the strategic insights of green finance and ESG governance.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the bias effect in the application of artificial intelligence in China and its impact on the employment structure of the labor force. Using statistical analysis and modeling methods, the study analyzes the relevant data of China's labor market from 2013 to 2023.The study first defines the elasticity of substitution, the technology bias index and the labor allocation bias index and, on this basis, builds a model to calculate the three indices.The calculation results show that from 2013 to 2023, the factor allocation bias effect in China's labor market favors low-end labor; the technology bias effect between low-end and mid-end labor favors mid-end labor; and the bias effect between low-end and mid-end labor inhibits the employment of low-end labor. The initial phenomenon of polarization began to appear in China's labor market.Next, the study conducted a correlation analysis and found that the size of AI applications is negatively correlated with the employment of the low-end and mid-end labor force and positively correlated with the employment of the high-end labor force. This implies that the expansion of AI applications in China has helped to promote the employment of the high-end labor force, but has been detrimental to the employment of the mid- and low-end labor force, especially the mid-end labor force.Finally, based on the findings of the study, the following countermeasures are proposed: deepen the degree of human-machine synergy, realize two-way empowerment of human-machine; improve the quality of higher education, strengthen the training of employment skills, improve the mechanism of employment security, and improve the social security system.},

abstract = {The proliferation of language models has marked a significant advancement in technology and industry in recent years. The training of these models largely involves human feedback, a procedure that faces challenges including intensive resource demands and subjective human preferences. In this work, we incorporate feedback provided by artificial intelligence (AI) models instead of relying entirely on human feedback. We propose a simulation optimization framework to train the language model. The objective function for training is approximated using feedback from both human and AI models. We employ the method of control variate to reduce the variance of the approximated objective function. Additionally, we provide a procedure for deciding the sample size to acquire preferences from both human and AI models. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed procedure enhances the performance of the language model.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have the potential to accelerate economic growth and promote sustainable development in developing countries. Particularly in Africa, the technology is expected to solve societal challenges, leapfrog, and promote sustainable communities. The literature presents examples of AI use cases in Africa to exemplify the opportunities, benefits, challenges, and risks of AI. Also, available reports highlight similar narratives with recommendations to improve the status quo. While such recommendations are essential, assessing what actions have already been implemented toward AI adoption is equally important. Still, more research is needed to showcase a holistic view of efforts taken by African countries to prepare for planning and implementing AI responsibly. This paper bridges the gap by examining the readiness of AI adoption in African countries from the literature using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. Findings reveal the need for further initiatives to realize the positive outcomes of AI technologies. The paper concludes by proposing the research areas that require further exploration from the context of African countries.},

Although Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning offers a novel approach to managing energy among multiple prosumers, challenges such as environmental volatility, the safeguarding of prosumer privacy, and computational demands persist. This research aims to explore a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that employs parameter sharing and deep deterministic policy gradients to enhance learning efficiency and mitigate training complexities through shared strategies and experiences among agents. Additionally, by leveraging a reputable third party for disseminating comprehensive community market data to prosumers, this approach not only promises to secure prosumer privacy effectively but also to minimize environmental uncertainty and augment the algorithm's scalability.},

An intelligent architecture inspired by cyber twins is proposed to explore the unique visual, behavioral, and physiological experiences of individuals with anxiety disorders while working in smart office environments. Temporal data mining is utilized for framing data granules, and quantum probability techniques are employed for anomaly detection within the framework. Additionally, a novel multilayer Convolutional Neural Network is introduced to predict a quantifiable Health Vulnerability Index. A smart alert system is included, capable of notifying caregivers of any identified health concerns, enabling timely assistance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, it was tested on real-world data comprising 82,235 cases. The results demonstrate that the method excels in several key performance metrics: time efficiency (24.6 seconds), classification efficiency (Precision (92.77\%), Specificity (92.43\%), and Sensitivity (92.82\%)), decision-making efficiency ( (r^{2}=79\%) ), error rate (AAE 0.31\%), and stability (75\%), surpassing current state-of-the-art methodologies.},

abstract = {The appearance of inflammatory language on social media by college or university students is quite prevalent, inspiring platforms to engage in community safety mechanisms. Escalating hate speech entails creating sophisticated artificial intelligence-based, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to detect offensive internet content. With a few noteworthy exceptions, the majority of the studies on automatic hate speech recognition have emphasized high-resource languages, mainly English. We bridge this gap by addressing hate speech detection in Punjabi (Gurmukhi), a low-resource Indo-Aryan language articulated in Indian educational institutions. This research identifies cross-lingual hate speech in the code-switched English-Punjabi language used on social media. It proposes an approach combining the best hate speech detection techniques to cover existing state-of-the-art system gaps and limitations. In this method, the Roman Punjabi is transliterated, and then Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) based models are employed for hate detection. The proposed model has achieved 0.86 precision and 0.83 recall, and various higher educational institutions could employ it to discover the issues/domains where hate prevails the most.},

abstract = {Typeface design plays a vital role in graphic and communication design. Different typefaces are suitable for different contexts and can convey different emotions and messages. Typeface design still relies on skilled designers to create unique styles for specific needs. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been applied to typeface generation, but these methods face challenges due to the high annotation requirements of typeface generation datasets, which are difficult to obtain. Furthermore, machine-generated typefaces often fail to meet designers’ specific requirements, as dataset annotations limit the diversity of the generated typefaces. In response to these limitations in current typeface generation models, we propose an alternative approach to the task. Instead of relying on dataset-provided annotations to define the typeface style vector, we introduce a transformer-based language model to learn the mapping between a typeface style description and the corresponding style vector. We evaluated the proposed model using both existing and newly created style descriptions. Results indicate that the model can generate high-quality, patent-free typefaces based on the input style descriptions provided by designers.

However, AI's impact is not equally present for the different stages of an innovation process, showing more prominence in the idea generation stage. Through an integrative review, we can explore how AI has contributed to different steps of innovation processes implemented through IMS. AI-driven approaches, so far, have been opening possibilities to manage creative processes, such as automating specific tasks, analyzing large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends, and providing real-time feedback to enhance ideation and decision-making.

abstract = {This research aims at the problem of measurement data distortion in contact profilometers caused by factors such as probe contamination and scanning position deviation. An automatic annotation method based on signal processing and geometric correction is proposed. Signal denoising is achieved through Fourier transform. The derivative operation is combined to extract contour characteristic parameters, and the rotation matrix is used to correct the tilt error of the workpiece.Experiments show that, on the premise of retaining the original contour features,the annotation error of the notch width is less than 0.05 mm, and the calculation accuracy of the arc radius reaches 99.2\%. This significantly improves the automatic annotation efficiency of the contours of complex workpieces. The research results provide reliable technical support for high-precision measurement in the field of industrial inspection.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of the digital economy, the efficiency, security and transparency of the platform have become increasingly important. Traditional platforms often encounter some problems when processing large amounts of user data, such as data insecurity, information asymmetry, and slow service response. To solve these problems, we proposed a new service model optimization method that combines cluster analysis with blockchain technology to improve the platform's operating efficiency and service quality. In the study, we used several common clustering algorithms, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering, to analyze user behavior data on digital platforms and find different user behavior patterns. At the same time, we also introduced blockchain technology to ensure that data can be stored and managed securely. Through its decentralized mechanism and smart contracts, we automated some processes and reduced manual operations. In the experimental phase, we collected 3,000 user behavior data from China's JD platform. Through cluster analysis, we divided users into several different groups based on their behavioral characteristics, and then combined blockchain technology to optimize the service processes of these user groups. The effect of this combination strategy is very obvious. The experimental results show that cluster analysis can effectively identify the differentiated needs of different user groups, and blockchain technology has brought significant improvements in data security, transparency and overall service efficiency. However, it should be said that the system will become a bit complicated after the introduction of blockchain.},

Our findings indicate that while a substantial number of teenagers still have limited or contradictory understanding of the topic, even short-term workshops can be effective in demystifying core AI/ML concepts when the activities are tailored to their interests. Furthermore, we find that cultural background and language may factor into how teenagers perceive AI.

By applying advanced intelligent algorithms of artificial intelligence, verb recognition can be better processed and the quality and accuracy of MT can be improved. Based on Neural machine translation (NMT), basic attention mechanisms, historical attention information, dynamically obtain information related to the generated words, and constraint mechanisms were introduced to embed semantic information, represent polysemy, and annotate semantic roles of verbs. This article used the Workshop on MT (WMT), British National Corpus (BNC), Gutenberg, Reuters Corpus, and OpenSubtitles corpus, and enhanced the data in the corpora. The improved NMT model was compared with traditional NMT models, Rule-Based MT (RBMT), and Statistical MT (SMT). The experimental results showed that the average verb semantic matching degree of the improved NMT model in five corpora was 0.85, and the average Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score in five corpora was 0.90. The improved NMT model in this article can effectively improve the accuracy of verb recognition in MT, providing new methods for verb recognition in MT.},

A knowledge graph was constructed by Neo4j, which plainly reflects the hierarchical structure and relationships among these information items. Further, the study statistically assessed the impact of semantic similarity computations and network analysis techniques like PageRank on mapping information points to particular OBE objectives. Improved alignment between knowledge points and OBE objectives is demonstrated by experimental results that show a 6\% increase in semantic similarity and a 30\% decrease in mapping variance. In addition, utilizing the knowledge graph for teaching optimization resulted in a 7\% decrease in overall course satisfaction and a 15\% decrease in the core knowledge acquisition time. These results highlight the potential for using AI-driven systems and data analysis to improve lesson design in online education settings.},

Alt text is indispensable for visually impaired individuals to understand visual content through assistive technologies. Nonetheless, the manual generation of high-quality alt text at scale continues to pose a considerable difficulty because of the requisite skill and time involved.This paper introduces AltGen, a framework utilizing generative AI to automate the development of alt text for EPUB files. AltGen uses pre-trained transformer models to provide descriptive and contextually pertinent alt text. It employs a structured process encompassing data extraction, visual content analysis with computer vision models (e.g., CLIP, ViT), and context-sensitive text generation utilizing fine-tuned large language models. The produced alt-text is assessed by computational measures, including cosine similarity and BLEU scores, and qualitative input from visually challenged individuals. Experimental findings demonstrate that AltGen lowers accessibility errors by 97.5\%, with participants noting substantial enhancements in content understanding and usability.},

abstract = {Generative recommender systems have gained increasing attention as an innovative approach that directly generates item identifiers for recommendation tasks. Despite their potential, a major challenge is the effective construction of item identifiers that align well with recommender systems. Current approaches often treat item tokenization and generative recommendation training as separate processes, which can lead to suboptimal performance. To overcome this issue, we introduce ETEGRec, a novel End-To-End Generative Recommender that unifies item tokenization and generative recommendation into a cohesive framework. Built on a dual encoder-decoder architecture, ETEGRec consists of an item tokenizer and a generative recommender. To enable synergistic interaction between these components, we propose a recommendation-oriented alignment strategy, which includes two key optimization objectives: sequence-item alignment and preference-semantic alignment. These objectives tightly couple the learning processes of the item tokenizer and the generative recommender, fostering mutual enhancement. Additionally, we develop an alternating optimization technique to ensure stable and efficient end-to-end training of the entire framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to traditional sequential recommendation models and existing generative recommendation baselines.

Finally, this article conducted empirical research and application using the F1000 open review platform, and the results showed that the proposed algorithm can assign multiple label scores to each author, achieving multi angle recognition of author influence, making author influence more comprehensive and three-dimensional. Through relevant analysis with traditional identification methods, the author believes that the open review recognition algorithm can play a certain complementary role in identifying author influence. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the open review algorithm into the existing author influence evaluation and recognition system, so as to more comprehensively and vividly reflect the author's influence and personal characteristics, better provide and recommend truly high-quality and excellent authors and articles to the academic community, and promote the healthy dissemination of science.},

Amidst the growing integration of AI in various aspects of life and its ethical implications, understanding AI becomes crucial for effective interaction with AI technologies. The PAILQ-6 emerges in response to the need for an accessible instrument that evaluates general AI literacy without compromising on clarity or depth, suitable for both academic and practical applications. This paper presents the development process of the PAILQ-6, consisting of six items derived from established components of AI literacy, structured as a seven-point Likert scale for easy administration and digital compatibility. The validation study was conducted from data of a gender-balanced sample of 232 UK adults. The article demonstrates the PAILQ-6's reliability and validity through exploratory factor analysis, showing a two-factor structure. The findings reveal the scale's good internal consistency and convergent validity. The study highlights demographic predictors of AI literacy perceptions, indicating a possible gender disparity and the positive influence of higher education on perceived AI competency.},

This study discusses seven strategic factors, including policy guarantee, stakeholder collaboration, financial capability, and public demands, information security, data availability, and AI infrastructure, and identifies their configurations which lead to a high smart city performance via the adoption of AI. A theoretical model is developed to understand smart city practice in 31 capital cities in the mainland of China. The findings reveal the complexity of AI adoption in smart cities from a configurational perspective and indicate that these factors do not work in isolation, but in combination with others to promote AI adoption in smart cities. Understanding the configurational relationships of these factors can help smart city strategists in their planning and policymaking relating to the development of smart cities.},

abstract = {Collective intelligence (CI) is an interdisciplinary field that draws on a wide range of academic disciplines but has struggled to capitalise on cross-pollination between fields, particularly ones which do not self-identify with the collective intelligence label. Past studies have largely undertaken a qualitative and manual approach to classifying different trends in the CI literature. This method risks missing a significant proportion of publications in the field. To this end, we present the first attempt to reflect the field to itself through an automated and quantitative descriptive approach using Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to collect and analyse 39,334 CI papers. We further focus our investigation on a subset of the CI literature, at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and CI to understand how these two fields are interacting. We show that while the annual number of CI-only publications has remained steady since 2015, AI+CI research has continued to increase. Publications in the crossover of AI+CI are growing at a faster rate than CI-only papers but show less topical and disciplinary breadth. This may be having a spillover effect on the topical focus of non-AI collective intelligence research. We hope this analysis sheds more light on the dynamics of the CI ecosystem.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has recently made rapid advancements, blurring the boundaries of intelligence between humans and machines. Its characteristic of generating different answers to the same question often evokes the thought process of humans. This study explores how AI-generated code, with minimal human intervention, can improve performance. There are over 100 algorithms capable of solving an NP-hard problem, the traveling salesperson problem, and it is difficult for one person to know all of them. Therefore, it is nearly impossible for a human to manually combine the advantages of various algorithms into a hybrid code. However, by leveraging AI, even someone who has no knowledge of the algorithms can generate a hybrid code that combines the strengths of different algorithms. In this experiment, AI-generated codes based on multiple algorithms are applied to genetic algorithms. The performance of hybrid codes, after undergoing crossover and mutation, was evaluated. The results showed that the performance of the AI-generated hybrid code surpassed that of the best-performing single algorithm code. This study demonstrates that AI can go beyond the mere application of existing algorithms by autonomously generating code and combining different algorithms to implement hybrid optimization techniques.},

abstract = {As an important platform for corporate financing and investor trading, the stock market plays an important role in economic development and capital allocation. How to predict stock price effectively has become the object of many scholars' research. In recent years, with the swift advancement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), their performance in the field of stock price prediction has attracted wide attention. This study proposes an improved Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) stock price prediction model, with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) as a generator. Compared with traditional GANs, the choice of GRU ensures that improved WGAN-GP has excellent prediction accuracy while being stable in training, and the inclusion of Residual Neural Network in the discriminator significantly improves the predictive performance of the model. In addition, Bull/Bear Ratio (BR) is introduced into the model as an input feature, which can well reflect investor sentiment.},

The education quality evaluation system combines big data and artificial intelligence technology, uses artificial intelligence model construction, analyzes the collected teaching quality evaluation index data, and generates objective results for education quality evaluation. The teaching quality evaluation of higher education teaching quality is a more complex system engineering. Its remarkable characteristics are complex levels, strong structure, large amount of information processed, and need to consume a lot of manpower, material and financial resources. The traditional manual processing method can not adapt to the requirements of accurate evaluation, fast evaluation and good evaluation. Therefore, this study can help to realize the artificial intelligence of teaching evaluation, combined with computer network technology, so that the evaluation is more suitable for the requirements of higher education teaching quality evaluation.},

abstract = {Ethical AI has become increasingly important, and it has been attracting attention from academia and industry, due to its increased popularity in real-world applications with fairness concerns. It also places fundamental importance on ethical considerations in determining legitimate and illegitimate uses of AI. Organizations that apply ethical AI have clearly stated well-defined review processes to ensure adherence to legal guidelines. Therefore, the wave of research at the intersection of ethical AI in data mining and machine learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and social science. Despite these successes, ethical AI still faces many challenges, such as a lack of interpretable and explainable methods for fairness-aware deep learning models, etc. Consequently, there is an urgent need to bring experts and researchers together at prestigious venues to discuss ethical AI, which has been rarely seen in previous KDD conferences. This workshop will provide a premium platform for both research and industry from different backgrounds to exchange ideas on opportunities, challenges, and cutting-edge techniques in ethical AI.},

abstract = {The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has brought many conveniences to people, and at the same time has had a huge impact on the traditional education model. Interactive learning platforms have become mainstream in the context of the big data era. This article takes an online course in a university as an example to explore user interest points, demand characteristics and knowledge acquisition rules in an artificial intelligence system environment. After processing and analyzing students' browsing behavior in different scenarios, the corresponding results are returned to the database to better grasp the user's preference information and provide more services for teaching. At the same time, through the application of machine intelligence algorithms and AI technology, the personalized recommendation capabilities of the learning platform can be improved to meet students' personalized learning needs. This article tests the algorithm of the system. The test results show that the content-based recommendation algorithm performs medium to high in accuracy, but its coverage is low and is not affected by data sparsity. The collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm performs generally highest in terms of accuracy and coverage, with an accuracy rate of 96\%, and is sensitive to sparse data. The hybrid recommendation algorithm has high accuracy and coverage, and factors such as data sparsity have a medium to high impact on it. Recommendation algorithms based on deep learning show high levels of accuracy and coverage, and their impact on factors such as data sparsity is also moderate to high. However, although artificial intelligence technology has broad prospects for application in the field of education, it also faces some challenges, such as privacy protection and compliance with data use. Therefore, in the process of promoting and applying artificial intelligence technology, it is necessary to strengthen compliance with relevant laws and regulations to ensure that students' information security and privacy rights are effectively protected.},
