  abstract = {The global financial crisis of 2008 has led to the increased scrutiny of governance and conduct of financial services firms. A key component of monitoring conduct within this area is Financial Services Compliance Management. Financial institutions need to adhere to legislation such as the European MiFID II and GDPR through to anti-money laundering compliance. A recent report by Thomson Routers in 2018 has found through a survey with 800 financial firms that 66\% of firms expect the cost of senior compliance staff to increase, up from 60\% of firms in 2017, indicating a continuing growth in spending on compliance. Effective solutions need to be in place to mitigate these increasing costs while enhancing the compliance workflow. Doing this would provide a market edge. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been gaining traction within the compliance management domain from both regulators and financial institutions in areas such as trade and market surveillance to regulatory compliance assurance. These areas share a commonality in terms of the volume of data to monitor often in real-time and from disparate sources both structured and unstructured with an emphasis on ensuring data quality and handling underlying bias in data. In this paper, an overview of the key use case areas of AI and ML in the compliance management domain will be provided. Detailed analysis on the application of specific AI solutions such as natural language processing, data discovery and generative modelling is introduced.},

  abstract = {Owing to the rich emerging multimedia applications and services in the past decade, super large amount of multimedia data has been produced for the purpose of advanced research in multimedia. Furthermore, multimedia research has made great progress on image/video content analysis, multimedia search and recommendation, multimedia streaming, multimedia content delivery etc. At the same time, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undergone a "new" wave of development since being officially regarded as an academic discipline in 1950s, which should give credits to the extreme success of deep learning. Thus, one question naturally arises: What happens when multimedia meets Artificial Intelligence?To answer this question, this tutorial disseminates and promotes the concept of Multimedia Intelligence through discussing the mutual-influence between multimedia and Artificial Intelligence, which is an exciting and fast-growing research direction in both multimedia and machine learning. We will advocate novel, high-quality research findings, and innovative solutions to multimedia intelligence through exploring the mutual influences between multimedia and Artificial Intelligence from two aspects: i) multimedia drives Artificial Intelligence to experience a paradigm shift towards more explainability and ii) Artificial Intelligence in turn injects new ways of thinking for multimedia research. As such, these two aspects form a loop in which multimedia and Artificial Intelligence interactively enhance each other. In this tutorial, we discuss what and how efforts have been done in literature and share our insights on research directions that deserve further study to produce potentially profound impact on multimedia intelligence.This topic is at the core of the scope of ACM Multimedia, and is attractive to MM audience from both academia and industry.},

  abstract = {With the transformation of medical model and the promotion of the construction of healthy China, continuing to follow the traditional development model has been unable to meet the health needs of the new era. As early as the 1970s, traditional Chinese medicine tried to connect with artificial intelligence technology to seek a breakthrough in the development model of traditional Chinese medicine. In the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial reform, artificial intelligence, as an important driving force, presents new characteristics such as deep learning, cross-border integration and man-machine cooperation, which is more conducive to the organic combination with traditional Chinese medicine. As a traditional Chinese medicine therapy, the five elements music therapy, with its unique pertinence, can make the five tones and the five internal organs reach a harmonious resonance state when the patients listen, and make the body resonate, so as to smooth the spirit and express their feelings. Five elements music therapy has achieved great results in clinical psychotherapy, and through the combination with artificial intelligence, five elements music therapy can be presented to patients in a closer way. This paper aims to explore the development of this innovative way.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence is known as one of the three cutting-edge technologies in the 21st century and has been integrated into many fields of society. In recent years, with the country's encouragement, policy relaxation, and the continuous "Chinese medicine awakening upsurge," "AI + Chinese medicine + health" has become a national strategy and development aspiration. As an essential part of Chinese medicine, TCM nursing is guided by the holistic view of TCM and the concept of dialectical nursing. It can significantly improve by providing TCM characteristics of daily life nursing, diet nursing, emotional nursing, and appropriate nursing techniques. The life quality of patients meets the patients' needs for medical and health services. At present, the application of artificial intelligence technology of Chinese medicine nursing is still in its infancy. This article aims to review the application of artificial intelligence in dialectical nursing, daily life nursing, diet nursing, emotional nursing, and traditional Chinese medicine nursing technology. It also discusses the potential challenges of artificial intelligence and its prospects for application. Provide a reference for the development of the field.},

With the common sense of human being as the only intelligent life with “self-consciousness”, only human's self-consciousness can be taken as a model in order to build AI with self-consciousness. In this paper, the theories of self-consciousness from the perspectives of psychology, cognitive neuroscience, philosophy and cognitive science were introduced with the hope of providing new ideas for the development of AI with self-consciousness.},

Liberalism relies on the privacy and autonomy of individuals, their ordering through a public market, and, more recently, a measure of equality guaranteed by the state. We argue that these forms of regulation and ethical analysis are largely incompatible with the techno-political and techno-economic dimensions of artificial intelligence. By analyzing liberal regulatory solutions in the form of privacy and data protection, regulation of public markets, and fairness in AI, we expose how the data economy and artificial intelligence have transcended liberal legal imagination. Organizations use artificial intelligence to exceed the bounded rationality of individuals and each other. This has led to the private consolidation of markets and an unequal hierarchy of control operating mainly for the purpose of shareholder value. An artificial intelligence will be only as ethical as the purpose of the social system that operates it. Inspired by the science of artificial life as an alternative to artificial intelligence, we consider data intermediaries: sociotechnical systems composed of individuals associated around collectively pursued purposes. An attention cooperative, that prioritizes its incoming and outgoing data flows, is one model of a social system that could form and maintain its own autonomous purpose.},

  abstract = {In recent years, with rapid technological advancement in both computing hardware and algorithm, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant advantage over human being in a wide range of fields, such as image recognition, education, autonomous vehicles, finance, and medical diagnosis. However, AI-based systems are generally vulnerable to various security threats throughout the whole process, ranging from the initial data collection and preparation to the training, inference, and final deployment. In an AI-based system, the data collection and pre-processing phase are vulnerable to sensor spoofing attacks and scaling attacks, respectively, while the training and inference phases of the model are subject to poisoning attacks and adversarial attacks, respectively. To address these severe security threats against the AI-based systems, in this article, we review the challenges and recent research advances for security issues in AI, so as to depict an overall blueprint for AI security. More specifically, we first take the lifecycle of an AI-based system as a guide to introduce the security threats that emerge at each stage, which is followed by a detailed summary for corresponding countermeasures. Finally, some of the future challenges and opportunities for the security issues in AI will also be discussed.},

Whilst there were notable developments in the area of (general, not necessarily legal) XAI, user experience studies regarding such methods, as well as more general studies pertaining to the concept of explainability among the users are still lagging behind. This paper firstly, assesses the performance of different explainability methods (Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP), in explaining the predictions for a legal text classification problem; those explanations were then judged by legal professionals according to their accuracy. Secondly, the same respondents were asked to give their opinion on the desired qualities of (explainable) artificial intelligence (AI) legal decision system and to present their general understanding of the term XAI. This part was treated as a pilot study for a more pronounced one regarding the lawyer's position on AI, and XAI in particular.},

  abstract = {Trust is a central component of the interaction between people and AI, in that 'incorrect' levels of trust may cause misuse, abuse or disuse of the technology. But what, precisely, is the nature of trust in AI? What are the prerequisites and goals of the cognitive mechanism of trust, and how can we promote them, or assess whether they are being satisfied in a given interaction? This work aims to answer these questions. We discuss a model of trust inspired by, but not identical to, interpersonal trust (i.e., trust between people) as defined by sociologists. This model rests on two key properties: the vulnerability of the user; and the ability to anticipate the impact of the AI model's decisions. We incorporate a formalization of 'contractual trust', such that trust between a user and an AI model is trust that some implicit or explicit contract will hold, and a formalization of 'trustworthiness' (that detaches from the notion of trustworthiness in sociology), and with it concepts of 'warranted' and 'unwarranted' trust. We present the possible causes of warranted trust as intrinsic reasoning and extrinsic behavior, and discuss how to design trustworthy AI, how to evaluate whether trust has manifested, and whether it is warranted. Finally, we elucidate the connection between trust and XAI using our formalization.},

The LearningML project aims to bring the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to children and people interested in acquiring knowledge on this subject in an easy way. AI has heavily irrupted in society and everyone is using, more or less consciously, application based on AI. Therefore, some kind of AI literacy is needed if we are to educate critically thinking citizens able to understand technologies that have a relevant impact on their lives. In this presentation we show how LearningML can help us to reach this goal trough programming applications based on Machine Learning (ML), the most prevalent subfield of AI today.},

  abstract = {We are largely used to hearing explanations. For example, if someone thinks you are sad today, they might reply to your “why?” with “because you were so Hmmmmm-mmm-mmm”. Today’s Artificial Intelligence (AI), however, is – if at all – largely providing explanations of decisions in a visual or textual manner. While such approaches are good for communication via visual media such as in research papers or screens of intelligent devices, they may not always be the best way to explain; especially when the end user is not an expert. In particular, when the AI’s task is about Audio Intelligence, visual explanations appear less intuitive than audible, sonified ones. Sonification has also great potential for explainable AI (XAI) in systems that deal with non-audio data – for example, because it does not require visual contact or active attention of a user. Hence, sonified explanations of AI decisions face a challenging, yet highly promising and pioneering task. That involves incorporating innovative XAI algorithms to allow pointing back at the learning data responsible for decisions made by an AI, and to include decomposition of the data to identify salient aspects. It further aims to identify the components of the preprocessing, feature representation, and learnt attention patterns that are responsible for the decisions. Finally, it targets decision-making at the model-level, to provide a holistic explanation of the chain of processing in typical pattern recognition problems from end-to-end. Sonified AI explanations will need to unite methods for sonification of the identified aspects that benefit decisions, decomposition and recomposition of audio to sonify which parts in the audio were responsible for the decision, and rendering attention patterns and salient feature representations audible. Benchmarking sonified XAI is challenging, as it will require a comparison against a backdrop of existing, state-of-the-art visual and textual alternatives, as well as synergistic complementation of all modalities in user evaluations. Sonified AI explanations will need to target different user groups to allow personalisation of the sonification experience for different user needs, to lead to a major breakthrough in comprehensibility of AI via hearing how decisions are made, hence supporting tomorrow’s humane AI’s trustability. Here, we introduce and motivate the general idea, and provide accompanying considerations including milestones of realisation of sonifed XAI and foreseeable risks.},

  abstract = {Collective intelligence (CI) is an interdisciplinary field that draws on a wide range of academic disciplines but has struggled to capitalise on cross-pollination between fields, particularly ones which do not self-identify with the collective intelligence label. Past studies have largely undertaken a qualitative and manual approach to classifying different trends in the CI literature. This method risks missing a significant proportion of publications in the field. To this end, we present the first attempt to reflect the field to itself through an automated and quantitative descriptive approach using Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to collect and analyse 39,334 CI papers. We further focus our investigation on a subset of the CI literature, at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and CI to understand how these two fields are interacting. We show that while the annual number of CI-only publications has remained steady since 2015, AI+CI research has continued to increase. Publications in the crossover of AI+CI are growing at a faster rate than CI-only papers but show less topical and disciplinary breadth. This may be having a spillover effect on the topical focus of non-AI collective intelligence research. We hope this analysis sheds more light on the dynamics of the CI ecosystem.},

To cope with this issue, heterogeneous NoCs are promising alternatives. Nevertheless, the design of optimized NoCs satisfying multiple performance objectives is extremely challenging and requires significant expertise. Prior works failed to combine many objectives or required an extended design space exploration time. In this paper, we propose an approach based on generative artificial intelligence to help pruning complex design spaces for heterogeneous NoCs, according to configurable performance objectives. This is made possible by the ability of Generative Adversarial Networks to learn and generate relevant design candidates for the target NoCs. The speed and flexibility of our solution enable a fast generation of optimized NoCs that fit users' expectations. Through some experiments, we show how to obtain competitive NoC designs reducing the power consumption with no communication performance or area penalty compared to a given conventional NoC design.},

  abstract = {Research in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted decision-making is experiencing tremendous growth with a constantly rising number of studies evaluating the effect of AI with and without techniques from the field of explainable AI (XAI) on human decision-making performance. However, as tasks and experimental setups vary due to different objectives, some studies report improved user decision-making performance through XAI, while others report only negligible effects. Therefore, in this article, we present an initial synthesis of existing research on XAI studies using a statistical meta-analysis to derive implications across existing research. We observe a statistically positive impact of XAI on users' performance. Additionally, the first results indicate that human-AI decision-making tends to yield better task performance on text data. However, we find no effect of explanations on users' performance compared to sole AI predictions. Our initial synthesis gives rise to future research investigating the underlying causes and contributes to further developing algorithms that effectively benefit human decision-makers by providing meaningful explanations.},

  abstract = {The software engineering industry is an everchanging domain requiring professionals to have a good knowledge base and adaptability skills.Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved substantial success in enhancing program analysis techniques and applications, including bug prediction. It is a promising direction by applying advanced Machine Learning techniques into suitable software engineering tasks.    The main goal of this paper is to propose a pedagogical interdisciplinary approach that pave the path for developing an e-learning platform serving to check the quality of the source code that students wrote by means of Artificial Intelligence techniques. By putting into practice this proposal, we are planning to show the students how to combine concepts learned from two different courses. The first step of this approach would be part of the Advanced Programming Methods, a Software Engineering related course, where students learn about the importance of writing good quality code and use software metrics as a mean of software quality assessment. Then, the following steps will be integrated into the Artificial Intelligence course, where students learn about different Machine Learning algorithms and how to apply them to solve practical problems. Thus, as an applicability in this respect, students use the metric values calculated for their projects developed at Advanced Programming Methods course as lab assignments and also to train (at Artificial Intelligence class) a bug detection model able to estimate the quality of new codebases.    The proposed approach is helpful for both students and teachers. On one side, it helps the students understand the importance of writing clean, high-quality code. And on the other side, it helps teachers in their evaluation process by giving them time to focus on different aspects of homework than the code quality.},

  abstract = {The recent surge in publications related to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has led to an almost insurmountable wall if one wants to get started or stay up to date with XAI. For this reason, articles and reviews that present taxonomies of XAI methods seem to be a welcomed way to get an overview of the field. Building on this idea, there is currently a trend of producing such taxonomies, leading to several competing approaches to construct them. In this paper, we will review recent approaches to constructing taxonomies of XAI methods and discuss general challenges concerning them as well as their individual advantages and limitations. Our review is intended to help scholars be aware of challenges current taxonomies face. As we will argue, when charting the field of XAI, it may not be sufficient to rely on one of the approaches we found. To amend this problem, we will propose and discuss three possible solutions: a new taxonomy that incorporates the reviewed ones, a database of XAI methods, and a decision tree to help choose fitting methods.},

  abstract = {Concrete is the most widely used engineered material in the world with more than 10 billion tons produced annually. Unfortunately, with that scale comes a significant burden in terms of energy, water, and release of greenhouse gases and other pollutants; indeed 8\% of worldwide carbon emissions are attributed to the production of cement, a key ingredient in concrete. As such, there is interest in creating concrete formulas that minimize this environmental burden, while satisfying engineering performance requirements including compressive strength. Specifically for computing, concrete is a major ingredient in the construction of data centers. In this work, we use conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs), a type of semi-supervised generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, to discover concrete formulas with desired properties. Our model is trained just using a small open dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository joined with environmental impact data from standard lifecycle analysis. Computational predictions demonstrate CVAEs can design concrete formulas with much lower carbon requirements than existing formulations while meeting design requirements. Next we report laboratory-based compressive strength experiments for five AI-generated formulations, which demonstrate that the formulations exceed design requirements. The resulting formulations were then used by Ozinga Ready Mix—a concrete supplier—to generate field-ready concrete formulations, based on local conditions and their expertise in concrete design. Finally, we report on how these formulations were used in the construction of buildings and structures in a Meta data center in DeKalb, IL, USA. Results from field experiments as part of this real-world deployment corroborate the efficacy of AI-generated low-carbon concrete mixes.},

  abstract = {Recent technological advances rely on accurate decision support systems that can be perceived as black boxes due to their overwhelming complexity. This lack of transparency can lead to technical, ethical, legal, and trust issues. For example, if the control module of a self-driving car failed at detecting a pedestrian, it becomes crucial to know why the system erred. In some other cases, the decision system may reflect unacceptable biases that can generate distrust. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), approved by the European Parliament in 2018, suggests that individuals should be able to obtain explanations of the decisions made from their data by automated processing, and to challenge those decisions. All these reasons have given rise to the domain of interpretable and explainable AI. AIMLAI aims at gathering researchers, experts and professionals, from inside and outside the domain of AI, interested in the topic of interpretable ML and interpretable AI. The workshop encourages interdisciplinary collaborations, with particular emphasis in knowledge management, Infovis, human computer interaction and psychology. It also welcomes applied research for use cases where interpretability matters. AIMLAI envisions to become a discussion venue for the advent of novel interpretable algorithms and explainability modules that mediate the communication between complex ML/AI systems and users.},

  abstract = {Our lives have been increasingly filled with technologies that use Artificial Intelligence (AI), whether at home, in public spaces, in social organizations, or in services. Like other technologies, adopting this emerging technology also requires society’s attention to the challenges that may arise from it. The media brought to the public some unexpected results from using these technologies, for example, the unfairness case in the COMPAS system. It became more evident that these technologies can have unintended consequences. In particular, in the public interest domain, these unintended consequences and their origin are a challenge for public policies, governance, and responsible AI. This work aims to identify the technological and ethical risks in data-driven decision systems based on AI and conduct a diagnosis of these risks and their perception. To do that, we use a triangulation of methods. In the first stage, a search on Web of Science has been performed. We consider all the 412 papers. The second stage corresponds to a analysis of experts. The papers have been classified according to the relevance to the topic by the experts. In the third stage, we use the survey method and include risk insights from stage two in our questions. We found 24 concerns which arise from the perspective of the ethical and technological risk perspective. The perception of participants regarding the level of concern they have with the risks of a data-driven system based on AI is high than their perception of society’s concern. Fairness is considered the risk whose perception is more severe. Fairness, Bias, Accountability, Interpretability, and Explainability are considered the most relevant concepts for a responsible AI. Consequently, also the most relevant for responsible governance of AI.},

  abstract = {Scholars and industry practitioners have debated how to best develop interventions for ethical artificial intelligence (AI). Such interventions recommend that companies building and using AI tools change their technical practices, but fail to wrangle with critical questions about the organizational and institutional context in which AI is developed. In this paper, we contribute descriptive research around the life of "AI" as a discursive concept and organizational practice in an understudied sphere--emerging AI startups--and with a focus on extra-organizational pressures faced by entrepreneurs. Leveraging a theoretical lens for how organizations change, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 entrepreneurs working at early-stage AI startups. We find that actors within startups both conform to and resist institutional pressures. Our analysis identifies a central tension for AI entrepreneurs: they often valued scientific integrity and methodological rigor; however, influential external stakeholders either lacked the technical knowledge to appreciate entrepreneurs' emphasis on rigor or were more focused on business priorities. As a result, entrepreneurs adopted hyped marketing messages about AI that diverged from their scientific values, but attempted to preserve their legitimacy internally. Institutional pressures and organizational constraints also influenced entrepreneurs' modeling practices and their response to actual or impending regulation. We conclude with a discussion for how such pressures could be used as leverage for effective interventions towards building ethical AI.},

With the accelerated integration of artificial intelligence technology in the intelligent manufacturing process and the international production division networks, its impact on the evolution of the global value chain needs further in-depth study. This paper examines the effects, heterogeneity and mechanism of the artificial intelligence on the dynamic evolution of global value chains. The study found that the development of artificial intelligence is conducive to promoting the upgrading of the division of labor in the global value chain, and the robustness test also confirms this finding. This role is more prominent in the samples of developed economies. Furthermore, artificial intelligence technology can promote the global value chain by improving the human capital accumulation and strengthening innovation capabilities. In the context of new infrastructure construction and digital economy transformation, this article provides implications for deepening the integration of innovation chain and industrial chain, and promoting high-quality development with the new generation of information technologies.},

  abstract = {Current mainstream biometric user authentication approaches are based on passive measurements of the subject's characteristics, and usually come with less-than-satisfactory accuracy. This paper takes a unique approach to biometric authentication. Specifically, instead of training a machine learning algorithm to recognize a legitimate user, the paper proposes a hybrid type of training, in which the legitimate user is also trained to use a customized instance of the machine. The user thus achieves a level of artificially-induced expertise to interact with the machine, which makes the user easier to recognize. We implement this concept in a mouse-based user authentication system, in which we produce customized machine instances by introducing an angle offset to the standard mouse. Human subjects then rely on their kinesthetic intelligence to achieve motor learning and visual-motor adaptation to the modified mouse. We design a 7-week IRB-approved experiment, collect data from 18 human subjects over this period, and evaluate the proposed approach with two existing state-of-the-art mouse-based authentication schemes. We find that, in both schemes, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline in which a regular unaltered mouse is used. Somewhat surprisingly, results also show that our approach improves the authentication performance even when both legitimate and non-legitimate users are trained to exactly the same instance of customized machine (i.e., the same mouse angle offset). In addition, we also observe that users can generally maintain their learned expertise even after one week of washout, which further demonstrates the practicality of the approach. Finally, we present a practical strategy to manage the enrollment of users in such a proposed system.},

This paper applies the recognition of deep learning framework to music recognition and music information extraction. Based on this deep learning framework, a music recognition and interactive generation system based on artificial intelligence technology is designed and implemented using server-side and client-side development techniques. This system can recognize and generate audio project files uploaded by users, and at the same time, users can use the interactive music generation system to edit and create this audio project file, and finally generate audio files based on the modified audio project. This overall system, on the one hand, lowers the threshold for users to create music, and on the other hand, provides great convenience for music creators.},

Recent developments in generative Machine Learning demonstrate the ability of AI systems to perform tasks which are often associated with creativity - generating imagery, composing music, writing prose, etc. This workshop will examine opportunities for incorporating this kind of functionality into the creative practice of designers, artists and craftspeople, in practical and experimental ways. It will focus on how AI might enhance, rather than supplant, individual human creativity, through collaboration, serendipity, and creative reflection. We seek to engage a broad range of creative practitioners and researchers, bringing together those already using AI in their practice with those who are new to the technology, to understand emerging approaches and define future opportunities.},

  abstract = {Automated monitoring of dark web (DW) platforms on a large scale is the first step toward developing proactive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). While there are efficient methods for collecting data from the surface web, large-scale dark web data collection is often hindered by anti-crawling measures. In particular, text-based CAPTCHA serves as the most prevalent and prohibiting type of these measures in the dark web. Text-based CAPTCHA identifies and blocks automated crawlers by forcing the user to enter a combination of hard-to-recognize alphanumeric characters. In the dark web, CAPTCHA images are meticulously designed with additional background noise and variable character length to prevent automated CAPTCHA breaking. Existing automated CAPTCHA breaking methods have difficulties in overcoming these dark web challenges. As such, solving dark web text-based CAPTCHA has been relying heavily on human involvement, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we propose a novel framework for automated breaking of dark web CAPTCHA to facilitate dark web data collection. This framework encompasses a novel generative method to recognize dark web text-based CAPTCHA with noisy background and variable character length. To eliminate the need for human involvement, the proposed framework utilizes Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to counteract dark web background noise and leverages an enhanced character segmentation algorithm to handle CAPTCHA images with variable character length. Our proposed framework, DW-GAN, was systematically evaluated on multiple dark web CAPTCHA testbeds. DW-GAN significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art benchmark methods on all datasets, achieving over 94.4\% success rate on a carefully collected real-world dark web dataset. We further conducted a case study on an emergent Dark Net Marketplace (DNM) to demonstrate that DW-GAN eliminated human involvement by automatically solving CAPTCHA challenges with no more than three attempts. Our research enables the CTI community to develop advanced, large-scale dark web monitoring. We make DW-GAN code available to the community as an open-source tool in GitHub.},

The development and spread of digital technologies in an accelerated way has deeply affected not only everyday life, but also the educational system. The differences between generations of students are increasing and this presents more challenges for educators in terms of the act of teaching and learning. The EASEAI workshop addresses this challenge by looking at the research fields of software engineering, education, and artificial intelligence to explore how they can be combined. Specifically, this workshop brings together researchers, teachers, and practitioners using advanced software engineering tools and artificial intelligence techniques in education. They discuss the current state of the art and practices to establish new future directions with the aim of favoring efficient learning that will develop students the necessary skills for whatever profession the future will bring.},

To avoid disastrous outcomes that can result from bias-laden AI systems, responsible AI builds on four important characteristics: fairness, accountability, transparency, and explainability. To stimulate further research on data provenance that enables responsible AI, this study outlines existing biases and discusses possible implementations of data provenance to mitigate them. We first review biases stemming from the data's origins and pre-processing. We then discuss the current state of practice, the challenges it presents, and corresponding recommendations to address them. We present a summary highlighting how our recommendations can help establish data provenance and thereby mitigate biases stemming from the data's origins and pre-processing to realize responsible AI-based systems. We conclude with a research agenda suggesting further research avenues.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence has been widely used in art education and learning due to its quick progress. &nbsp;Any creation made with the help of artificial intelligence is referred to as art design. It covers works generated independently by AI systems and works created in collaboration with humans and AI systems. The objective of directing the invention of environmental art design thinking is to stimulate students' learning and innovation abilities and teach students how to put design ideas into effect. Despite the progress of smart technologies, there are several challenges in increasing the teaching capabilities of technical art design courses, such as the influence of different variables, the absence of quantitative research, and the imperfection in the index system. In this paper, the Artificial intelligence-based Art design and teaching (AI-ADT) method in colleges increases the capacity to adapt to AI-oriented art education, establish intelligent teaching methods, and improve AI-oriented art teaching art knowledge and environments. The widespread application of artificial intelligence in design education has become a trend in development. Self-Learning Systems are software that incorporates machine learning techniques to allow computers to learn from and make judgments based on data without the need for explicit programming instructions. The art design profession should confirm and actively adapt to this development trend. Modify the original teaching mode, invent their teaching methods, continually enrich the teaching methods, enhance the quality of teaching, and constantly foster high-quality art design talents in the new age. AI-ADT investigates the optimization of the art design curriculum system in higher education institutions in the context of artificial intelligence. The experimental results show that the proposed method develops smart teaching (98.1\%), flexibility (96.5\%), performance (93.6\%), participation (94.9\%), and interaction (95.1\%).},

This paper illustrates findings from an empirical study with the purpose of familiarizing two classes of 11-12-year-old children (N=37) with central concepts related to AI, using existing material with modifications. During the sessions, children experimented with creative and hands-on Machine Learning activities, encouraging reflection around AI and the role of technology in everyday life. Children were asked about their views of AI first, and after that the concept was explained to them. Findings of the study suggest that some children's opinion about AI was changed after they were engaged in the learning activities. Observations also suggest that children seemed to learn more easily through hands-on activities and by listening to stories.},

  abstract = {This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. It is time to convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of science and technology in our country, information technology on the Internet has spread throughout our lives, and traditional accounting will inevitably be replaced by artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence processing accounts has become very important in the field of accounting. Management innovation and intelligent accounting also have a very significant impact on the long-term development of current accounting. If traditional accountants want to grow in the fiercely competitive financial industry, they need to strengthen their competitiveness and transform management accounting. This article adopts the method of theoretical research combined with actual proof research, with the literature research method as the main method, and then introduces the basic framework and research content of this article, and then systematically analyzes the collected data through questionnaire design and interview outline. According to the analysis of survey data, more than 68\% of accountants do not have the quality and ability of an accounting manager, only 4.85\% have the ability of a management accountant, and 17.07\% have the ability of an accounting manager. Through statistical data analysis, it is concluded that in the context of artificial intelligence, most accountants do not have the ability to transform management accountants.},

The authors analyze different organizational and environmental factors, the objectives, benefits, and risks of AI-supported decision-making. The findings show an increasing interest in the research on government decision-making based on AI. Finally, there is the potential of AI to support decision-making for the benefit of citizens and public value generation, collaboratively between governments, industry, and society. Future work will further analyze AI-based decision-making in government in depth.},

  abstract = {As networks have historically been built around connectivity, architectural features concerning quality of service, mobility, security and privacy have been added as afterthoughts - with consequent well known architectural headaches for their later integration. Despite Artificial Intelligence (AI) is more a means to an end, that an architectural feature itself, this is not completely different from what concerns its integration: in particular, while Cloud and Edge computing paradigms made it possible to use AI techniques to relieve part of network operation, however AI is currently little more than an additional tool. This paper describes a vision of future networks, where AI becomes a first class commodity: its founding principle lays around the concept of "fast and slow" type of AI reasoning, each of which offers different types of AI capabilities to process network data. We next outline how these building blocks naturally maps to different network segments, and discuss emerging AI-to-AI communication patterns as we move to more intelligent networks.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) can generate text virtually indistinguishable from text written by humans. A key question, then, is whether people believe news headlines generated by AI as much as news headlines generated by humans. AI is viewed as lacking human motives and emotions, suggesting that people might view news written by AI as more accurate. By contrast, two pre-registered experiments on representative U.S. samples (N = 4,034) showed that people rated news headlines written by AI as less accurate than those written by humans. People were more likely to incorrectly rate news headlines written by AI (vs. a human) as inaccurate when they were actually true, and more likely to correctly rate them as inaccurate when they were indeed false. Our findings are important given the increasing adoption of AI in news generation, and the associated ethical and governance pressures to disclose it use and address standards of transparency and accountability.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the size and complexity of the automotive development life-cycle increase the possibility of cyber-attacks. In this context, team developers play a primary role in managing cyber security, risk assessment, and all phases of software application development (concept phases, product development, cyber security validation, production, operations, and maintenance).   Currently, only generic standards exist and they are difficult to put into operation due to the lack of the required skills and knowledge. Therefore, this paper presents a vision model based on Quantum Artificial Intelligence that supports developers' decisions to integrate concrete design methods in the automotive development life-cycle. Organizations need to develop their process for developing vehicle components that comply with the new automotive standards. We suggest the usage of existing data sources (e.g., existing taxonomies) on Quantum Artificial Intelligence algorithms to suggest the best way, or the correct steps, to follow time by time to achieve user solutions.},

  abstract = {In the decade since 2010, successes in artificial intelligence have been at the forefront of computer science and technology, and vector space models have solidified a position at the forefront of artificial intelligence. At the same time, quantum computers have become much more powerful, and announcements of major advances are frequently in the news.  The mathematical techniques underlying both these areas have more in common than is sometimes realized. Vector spaces took a position at the axiomatic heart of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and this adoption was a key motivation for the derivation of logic and probability from the linear geometry of vector spaces. Quantum interactions between particles are modelled using the tensor product, which is also used to express objects and operations in artificial neural networks.  This paper describes some of these common mathematical areas, including examples of how they are used in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in automated reasoning and natural language processing (NLP). Techniques discussed include vector spaces, scalar products, subspaces and implication, orthogonal projection and negation, dual vectors, density matrices, positive operators, and tensor products. Application areas include information retrieval, categorization and implication, modelling word-senses and disambiguation, inference in knowledge bases, and semantic composition.  Some of these approaches can potentially be implemented on quantum hardware. Many of the practical steps in this implementation are in early stages, and some are already realized. Explaining some of the common mathematical tools can help researchers in both AI and quantum computing further exploit these overlaps, recognizing and exploring new directions along the way.},

Subsequently, using computer to recognize and process image information becomes more and more important. Image recognition technology is an important research field of artificial intelligence. This technology can enable computers to process a large amount of information instead of human beings, so as to free human beings from cumbersome workload. Image recognition technology [3-5] meets the relevant needs of actual users through the steps of relevant information acquisition, preprocessing and model training. Image recognition technology first defines the characteristics of related objects, then memory image matching, and finally image recognition. For the definition of the features of related objects, we can not only use the predefined features, but also train the related features through convolutional neural network.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence(AI) technology applications, new development opportunities have been brought to many very important fields, such as medical services, finance, education and teaching, transportation, energy development, etc., and it also brings new development opportunities to human society and brings more convenience. At the same time, in recent years, with the continuous improvement of living standards, more and more people choose to travel by air transportation with fast speed and good service. In addition, the number of airlines continues to increase and the high-speed railway network is also constantly developing. How airlines should reflect their advantages in the fierce market competition requires continuous improvement of the quality and level of aviation services. This article mainly adopts experimental analysis method and questionnaire survey method to explore the application of AI technology in aviation intelligent service. This paper investigates and analyzes the application function verification of intelligent service robots and the services that passengers of different ages hope to improve civil aviation. According to the experimental survey results, the accuracy of functions such as voice recognition, human body recognition, and business window guidance of intelligent service robots is high in the verification environment, and most passengers hope to solve the problem of walking distance.},

  abstract = {Large pre-trained models, also known as foundation models (FMs), are trained in a task-agnostic manner on large-scale data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks by fine tuning, few-shot, or even zero-shot learning. Despite their successes in language and vision tasks, we have yet to see an attempt to develop foundation models for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI). In this work, we explore the promises and challenges for developing multimodal foundation models for GeoAI. We first show the advantages of this idea by testing the performance of existing Large pre-trained Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. GPT-2 and GPT-3) on two geospatial semantics tasks. Results indicate that these task-agnostic LLMs can outperform task-specific fully-supervised models on both tasks with 2--9\% improvement in a few-shot learning setting. However, we also show the limitations of these existing foundation models given the multimodality nature of GeoAI, especially when dealing with geometries in conjunction with other modalities. So we discuss the possibility of a multimodal foundation model which can reason over various types of geospatial data through geospatial alignments. We conclude this paper by discussing the unique risks and challenges to develop such model for GeoAI.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision making are having a profound impact on our daily lives. These systems are vastly used in different high-stakes applications like healthcare, business, government, education, and justice, moving us toward a more algorithmic society. However, despite so many advantages of these systems, they sometimes directly or indirectly cause harm to the users and society. Therefore, it has become essential to make these systems safe, reliable, and trustworthy. Several requirements, such as fairness, explainability, accountability, reliability, and acceptance, have been proposed in this direction to make these systems trustworthy. This survey analyzes all of these different requirements through the lens of the literature. It provides an overview of different approaches that can help mitigate AI risks and increase trust and acceptance of the systems by utilizing the users and society. It also discusses existing strategies for validating and verifying these systems and the current standardization efforts for trustworthy AI. Finally, we present a holistic view of the recent advancements in trustworthy AI to help the interested researchers grasp the crucial facets of the topic efficiently and offer possible future research directions.},

In order to solve the complex power resource scheduling problem, this paper uses the artificial intelligence expert service system. The expert service system simulates the thinking mode of experts, and based on the knowledge and experience of experts, provides solutions for the scheduling problems in power system, such as accident handling, daily arrangement, power system equipment operation, etc. Expert service system includes knowledge base, production rules and control system. The knowledge base is generated by the knowledge and experience of experts, and the inference mechanism is used to select and use the content of the knowledge base to generate the rule set, according to which the control of the system is realized. It is proved that the expert service system is feasible in power resource scheduling. The expert service system improves the efficiency of power resource scheduling and reduces the workload of scheduling personnel. With the deepening of artificial intelligence research, various intelligent expert systems will appear in various fields of power system.},

  abstract = {Children encounter and use artificial intelligence (AI) with regularity, but the depth of their understanding of AI is often limited. In service of growing an AI and technology-literate K-12 population, it is important for young learners to engage in AI learning activities early and often. To foster the design of AI curricula, it is essential to understand what young children already know and how they feel about AI. The nascent field of AI-related self-report instrument development focuses largely on adult populations or AI's use in specific contexts, such as medicine. There remains a critical need to develop an AI attitudinal survey for young learners (ages 9 to 11). Building upon the extant survey development work of those in education and AI, we have designed a brief survey on students' self-efficacy for AI, interest and motivation toward AI, and attitudes toward AI. We used cognitive interviewing processes to ensure the items in the survey were readable and understandable by young students. Preliminary findings indicate young students have mixed understanding of what AI is, what it can do, and how they feel about AI. We discuss implications for researchers and practitioners and provide an overview of our continuing efforts to validate this instrument.},

  abstract = {Ethical AI has become increasingly important, and it has been attracting attention from academia and industry, due to its increased popularity in real-world applications with fairness concerns. It also places fundamental importance on ethical considerations in determining legitimate and illegitimate uses of AI. Organizations that apply ethical AI have clearly stated well-defined review processes to ensure adherence to legal guidelines. Therefore, the wave of research at the intersection of ethical AI in data mining and machine learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and social science. Despite these successes, ethical AI still faces many challenges, such as a lack of interpretable and explainable methods for fairness-aware deep learning models, etc. Consequently, there is an urgent need to bring experts and researchers together at prestigious venues to discuss ethical AI, which has been rarely seen in previous KDD conferences. This workshop will provide a premium platform for both research and industry from different backgrounds to exchange ideas on opportunities, challenges, and cutting-edge techniques in ethical AI.},

  abstract = {The traditional data processing uses machine as a passive feature detector or classifier for a given fixed dataset. However, we contend that this is not how humans understand and process data from the real world. Based on active inference, we propose a neural network model that actively processes the incoming data using predictive processing and actively samples the inputs from the environment that conforms to its internal representations. The model we adopt is the Helmholtz machine, a perfect parallel for the hierarchical model of the brain and the forward-backward connections of the cortex, thus available a biologically plausible implementation of the brain functions such as predictive processing, hierarchical message passing, and predictive coding under a machine-learning context. Besides, active sampling could also be incorporated into the model via the generative end as an interaction of the agent with the external world. The active sampling of the environment directly resorts to environmental salience and cultural niche construction. By studying a coupled multi-agent model of constructing a “desire path” as part of a cultural niche, we find a plausible way of explaining and simulating various problems under group flow, social interactions, shared cultural practices, and thinking through other minds.},

  abstract = {Manually diagnosing the I/O performance bottleneck for a single application (hereinafter referred to as the "job level'') is a tedious and error-prone procedure requiring domain scientists to have deep knowledge of complex storage systems. However, existing automatic methods for I/O performance bottleneck diagnosis have one major issue: the granularity of the analysis is at the platform or group level and the diagnosis results cannot be applied to the individual application. To address this issue, we designed and developed a method named "Artificial Intelligence for I/O" (AIIO), which uses AI and its interpretation technology to diagnose I/O performance bottlenecks at the job level automatically. By considering the sparsity of I/O log files, employing multiple AI models for performance prediction, merging diagnosis results across multiple models, and generalizing its performance prediction and diagnosis functions, AIIO can accurately and robustly identify the bottleneck of an even unseen application. Experimental results show that real and unseen applications can use the diagnosis results from AIIO to improve their I/O performance by at most 146 times.},

  abstract = {The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) has been the center of the most outstanding advancements in the last years. The ability to analyze considerable streams of data in real time makes these technologies the most promising tool in many domains, including cybersecurity. As an outstanding example, ML can be used for identifying malware because of its ability to detect patterns otherwise difficult to see for humans and hard-coded rules. As malware continues to evolve, ML will become increasingly important for keeping up with the latest threats. However, the use of AI and ML in security-relevant domains raised rightful concerns about their trustworthiness and robustness, especially in front of adaptive attackers. Additionally, privacy threats are now emerging as a crucial aspect and need proper testing and possibly mitigation to prevent data stealing and leakage of sensitive information. The AISec workshop provides a venue for presenting and discussing new developments in the intersection of security and privacy with AI and ML.

The current uncertainties on the consequences of the combined development of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data are gradually dissipating by impacting a few business processes in the hope of a future improvement in organizational productivity and social well-being [3].Thanks to the analysis of the latest publications and in particular articles and reports published by academics, consulting firms and think tanks, this article aims to build an exploratory representation of the expected effects of the development of AI in the process of analysis for the allocation or not of bank credit compared to the statistical approaches currently used [27].This exploratory review of the literature makes it possible to deduce the potential of the exploitation of big data in the detection of interactions between several pieces of information, making it possible to better assess the solvency of credit applicants. Thus, if the predictive improvement of this new credit analysis process allows precision in terms of decision-making, it also generates numerous legal, ethical and regulatory biases.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the rising income level of the population and the young consumer force brought about a continuous improvement and upgrading of the diet structure and rapid growth of the food cold chain logistics market. However, frequent outbreaks of food quality and safety issues have raised consumer concerns. As the key link of cold chain logistics, cold chain transportation has a direct and important impact on the freshness of food and even food safety. Facing the current situation of imperfect food cold chain transportation systems, it is necessary to make full use of artificial intelligence algorithms and convenient framework platforms in order to reduce food loss rates, strengthen transportation efficiency and improve customer satisfaction. In this paper, we study and summarize the application of artificial intelligence in cold chain transportation, and optimize the path planning problem of cold chain logistics delivery vehicles by using the bee colony algorithm. The environmental monitoring system and cold chain precise regulation cloud platform are used in the transportation process to monitor the external environment and guarantee the quality of food transportation. In the scheduling of cold chain transportation vehicles, the optimized ant colony algorithm is used to resolve the vehicle scheduling problem. The problem of specific vehicle search directionality from the scheduling source point to the target point of the logistics center is included in the optimization consideration, which will greatly improve the vehicle scheduling time and distance efficiency. The combination of artificial intelligence technology in cold chain transportation can reduce the average 10\% of human and material resources and effectively improve the quality of transported food, thus reducing transportation costs and food loss and ensuring food safety and sustainable development.},

  abstract = {This research explores emergent creative processes that develop between artist (interactor) and generative artificially intelligent (AI) technology when an AI system is positioned as a latent space n-dimensional journeying tool or more semantically as an ontological other that the artist works through. The authors investigate a new artistic process, building a latent space journeying AI diffusion system, and with it examining a more multimodal emotional approach to art making including how intentions of the artist are reshaped by journeying through the algorithmic transformation and re-presentation to question what is preserved, nurtured, lost, or irrevocably altered in the interplay of the autographic and the algorithmic. The study finds that neural media, as the authors term it, becomes a non-deterministic multimodal process of moving (an emotion journey) through AI latent space. This time and space n-dimensional artist journey is achieved through a series of choices and creative forks, including external perturbation from the AI system, the ontological “other” leading to the artist's innate expression of their emotional reactions of intermediate art artifacts on that journey to a final aesthetic artifact.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a visionary perspective on developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in the field of human mobility research. Human mobility profoundly influences our daily lives, impacting transportation systems, urban planning, logistics, and healthcare. While AI methods have made significant advancements in addressing human mobility challenges, they often struggle with the complexity and dynamic nature of this domain. The limitations arise from the narrow focus of existing AI systems, lacking the ability to generalize and adapt to new situations. To overcome these limitations, there is a growing interest in developing AGI systems. This paper explores the potential of AGI to revolutionize human mobility research by enabling systems to understand, learn, reason, and adapt across diverse domains and tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose the Mobility Foundation Model (MFM) and the concept of an intermediate modality is further introduced as a means to bridge the gap between different mobility modalities and scales. The unified representation allows the MFM to effectively learn and integrate information from various modalities. We also present a novel MFM as Administrator paradigm for leveraging MFM in complex mobility tasks. We hope that this paper will provide novel insights and open new directions in human mobility research.},

  abstract = {Context: Artificial intelligence (AI) methods and models have extensively been applied to support different phases of the software development lifecycle, including software testing (ST). Several secondary studies investigated the interplay between AI and ST but restricted the scope of the research to specific domains or sub-domains within either area.Objective: This research aims to explore the overall contribution of AI to ST, while identifying the most popular applications and potential paths for future research directions.Method: We executed a tertiary study following well-established guidelines for conducting systematic literature mappings in software engineering and for answering nine research questions.Results: We identified and analyzed 20 relevant secondary studies. The analysis was performed by drawing from well-recognized AI and ST taxonomies and mapping the selected studies according to them. The resulting mapping and discussions provide extensive and detailed information on the interplay between AI and ST.Conclusion: The application of AI to support ST is a well-consolidated and growing interest research topic. The mapping resulting from our study can be used by researchers to identify opportunities for future research, and by practitioners looking for evidence-based information on which AI-supported technology to possibly adopt in their testing processes.},

The immersive nature of these applications poses a unique challenge to traditional quality assessment methods. In fact, estimating user acceptance of immersive technologies is complex due to multiple aspects, such as usability, enjoyment, and cyber sickness. Artificial Intelligence-based approaches offer a promising solution to this problem, enabling objective evaluations of immersive multimedia such as spatial audios, point clouds, and light field images. This work presents an overview of different artificial intelligence techniques that have been used for quality assessments of immersive multimedia content, including machine learning algorithms, deep learning, and computer vision. The advantages of these techniques and some examples of practical application are provided. Future works are presented, underlining the possible outcomes of a Ph.D. study in this field.},

  abstract = {In recent years, web-based platforms and business applications have been rising in popularity deeming themselves indispensable as they constitute the main backbone of business processes and information sharing. However, the unprecedented increased number of cyber-attacks have been threatening their day-to-day operations. In particular, the Standard Query Language Injection Attack (SQLIA) remains one of the most prevalent cyber attacks targeting web-based applications. As a consequence, the SQLIA detection techniques need to be constantly revamped and stay up-to-date in order to achieve the full potential of mitigating such threats. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence model based on supervised machine learning techniques to detect SQLIA. As part of the proposed model, we introduce an input string validation technique as a primary anomaly identifier using pattern matching for SQL Query data with anomalies-injections. To evaluate our approach we injected one type of SQLIA that is tautology attacks and measured the performance of our model. We used three main classifiers in our model and our findings indicate a model prediction accuracy of 98.3605\% for Support Vector Machine (SVM), 96.296\% for K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and 97.530\% for Random Forest. The approach proposed in this paper has the potential of being used to integrate an automated SQL Injection detection mechanism with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Protection Systems (IPS).},

  abstract = {The speech signal has numerous features that represent the characteristics of a specific language and recognize emotions. It also contains information that can be used to identify the mental, psychological, and physical states of the speaker. Recently, the acoustic analysis of speech signals offers a practical, automated, and scalable method for medical diagnosis and monitoring symptoms of many diseases. In this paper, we explore the deep acoustic features from confirmed positive and negative cases of COVID-19 and compare the performance of the acoustic features and COVID-19 symptoms in terms of their ability to diagnose COVID-19. The proposed methodology consists of the pre-trained Visual Geometry Group (VGG-16) model based on Mel spectrogram images to extract deep audio features. In addition to the K-means algorithm that determines effective features, followed by a Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Machine (GA-SVM) classifier to classify cases. The experimental findings indicate the proposed methodology’s capability to classify COVID-19 and NOT COVID-19 from acoustic features compared to COVID-19 symptoms, achieving an accuracy of 97\%. The experimental results show that the proposed method remarkably improves the accuracy of COVID-19 detection over the handcrafted features used in previous studies.},

  abstract = {Recently, generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have experienced an incredible surge in interest and use. The proliferation of these technologies suggests that it would be prudent to raise awareness of the potential consequences of irresponsible use of these models. Indeed, to achieve trustworthy AI solutions, it is essential to promote AI education as a fundamental step. Educating people to use AI responsibly not only improves their understanding of the technology, but also equips them to address issues of bias and discrimination. Indeed, informed users are more likely to recognize when AI is producing biased or discriminatory results and to demand appropriate solutions. This awareness of the ethical implications of AI decisions is crucial for the responsible and socially conscious adoption of AI. The aim of this poster is to report the results obtained as a final thesis work, pursued within the context of the Human-Centred AI Masters (HCAIM) programme in Naples, focused on the analysis of users’ perceptions of biases in media created by generative AI models.},

Therefore, several governments in the world-initiated AI integration strategies by projecting their visions about the use of AI technologies in the public sector. Hence, it becomes relevant to analyze these strategies to develop a new knowledge that could be used by policymakers to learn how to improve their AI strategies. In this research in progress, we aim to dig the barriers that public sector bodies may encounter when adopting and using AI and the actions that could be undertaken to raise those barriers. This work focuses on the identification of barriers and actions for the adoption and use of artificial intelligence at the national level public sector. To do so, we develop a qualitative research design combining AI strategies qualitative analysis; interviews with relevant decision-makers; and discourse analysis of AI conferences. Based on this, we identify the barriers for the adoption of AI and categorize them into people, organization, process and information technology (IT). This could provide a better understanding and help governments to figure out the hurdles are experiencing. In addition, actions are identified to help them prevent and mitigate the identified barriers when integrating AI into their processes and services.},

Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using foundation models in geospatial artificial intelligence, known as GeoAI Foundation Models, for geographic question answering, remote sensing image understanding, map generation, and location-based services, among others. However, the development and application of GeoAI foundation models can pose serious privacy and security risks, which have not been fully discussed or addressed to date. This paper introduces the potential privacy and security risks throughout the lifecycle of GeoAI foundation models and proposes a comprehensive blueprint for research directions and preventative and control strategies. Through this vision paper, we hope to draw the attention of researchers and policymakers in geospatial domains to these privacy and security risks inherent in GeoAI foundation models and advocate for the development of privacy-preserving and secure GeoAI foundation models.},

  abstract = {Natural Language Generation (NLG) has improved exponentially in recent years thanks to the development of a large language model (LLM), this advancement has resulted in more fluent and coherent Natural Language Generation, which has contributed to improved development in downstream tasks such as abstractive summarization. Despite the recent progress in LLM, hallucination has become a serious problem in NLG. Hallucination happens when language models generate nonsensical or unfaithful text, which will lead to severe problems with reliability and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Controllable Generative Summarization via Multimodal Prompt (CGSMP), which uses entities extracted from content and images as multimodal prompt control signals, thereby reducing hallucination issues. Specifically, the proposed CGSMP consists of three main modules: (1) an image prefix module that obtains image representations; (2) a prompt encoder module that fusion entities and images as multimodal prompts; and (3) a pre-trained causal language model that fuses input and controllable prompt and serves as the backbone of the language model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the quality of generated summaries compared to the state of the arts.},

To inform designs for explainable AI (XAI), we conducted in-depth interviews with major stakeholders, both end-users (n = 24) and engineers (n = 15), to investigate how they made sense of AI applications and the associated biases according to situations of high and low stakes. We discussed users’ perceptions and attributions about AI biases and their desired levels and types of explainability. We found that personal relevance and boundaries as well as the level of stake are two major dimensions for developing user trust especially during biased situations and informing XAI designs.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented interest in developing Deep Learning methodologies for the generation of images and image sequences that are hardly distinguishable to the human eye from real ones. A major issue in this field is how the generation can be easily controlled. In this talk we will focus on some of our recent works in generative models that are primarily aimed at controllable generation. We will first present unsupervised methods for learning non-linear paths in the latent spaces of Generative Adversarial Networks such that following different paths lead to different types of changes (e.g., removing the background, changing head poses, or facial expressions) in the resulting images&nbsp;[4]. Subsequently, we will present a method that allows local editing by finding a Parts and Appearances decomposition in the GAN latent space&nbsp;[2]. Then, we will present recent works on reenactment&nbsp;[1], where the goal is to transfer the facial activity (pose, expressions, speech) of a certain person to another one, and recent works in which supervision for generation comes from language models&nbsp;[3]. Finally, we will touch on the technical challenges ahead, as well on the challenges that this creates in spreading misinformation.},

The design concept was motivated by the considerable interest in artificial intelligence (AI), voice user interfaces (VUI) within Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and the rapid digitalization of online food ordering as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study applied the concept-driven design research approach because it offered to make theoretical contributions while at the same time being design and concept-oriented. The result of this research is a revised design concept that has the potential to digitalize the dine-in restaurant business further and add to the understanding of human experience while interacting with a voice user interface. Finally, the research article manifests as an example of how interaction designers make theoretical contributions through design and how technologies can be combined in new contexts.},

  abstract = {The workplace has experienced extensive digital transformation, in part due to artificial intelligence's commercial availability. Though still an emerging technology, emotional artificial intelligence (EAI) is increasingly incorporated into enterprise systems to augment and automate organizational decisions and to monitor and manage workers. EAI use is often celebrated for its potential to improve workers' wellbeing and performance as well as address organizational problems such as bias and safety. Workers subject to EAI in the workplace are data subjects whose data make EAI possible and who are most impacted by it. However, we lack empirical knowledge about data subjects' perspectives on EAI, including in the workplace. To this end, using a relational ethics lens, we qualitatively analyzed 395 U.S. adults' open-ended survey (partly representative) responses regarding the perceived benefits and risks they associate with being subjected to EAI in the workplace. While participants acknowledged potential benefits of being subject to EAI (e.g., employers using EAI to aid their wellbeing, enhance their work environment, reduce bias), a myriad of potential risks overshadowed perceptions of potential benefits. Participants expressed concerns regarding the potential for EAI use to harm their wellbeing, work environment and employment status, and create and amplify bias and stigma against them, especially the most marginalized (e.g., along dimensions of race, gender, mental health status, disability). Distrustful of EAI and its potential risks, participants anticipated conforming to (e.g., partaking in emotional labor) or refusing (e.g., quitting a job) EAI implementation in practice. We argue that EAI may magnify, rather than alleviate, existing challenges data subjects face in the workplace and suggest that some EAI-inflicted harms would persist even if concerns of EAI's accuracy and bias are addressed.},

  abstract = {Data preparation -- the process of discovering, integrating, transforming, cleaning, and annotating data -- is one of the oldest, hardest, yet inevitable data management problems. Unfortunately, data preparation is known to be iterative, requires high human cost, and is error-prone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have shown very promising results on many data preparation tasks. At a high level, AI for data preparation (AI4DP) should have the following abilities. First, the AI model should capture real-world knowledge so as to solve various tasks. Second, it is important to easily adapt to new datasets/tasks. Third, data preparation is a complicated pipeline with many operations, which results in a large number of candidates to select the optimum, and thus it is crucial to effectively and efficiently explore the large space of possible pipelines.In this tutorial, we will cover three important topics to address the above issues: demystifying foundation models to inject knowledge for data preparation, tuning and adapting pre-trained language models for data preparation, and orchestrating data preparation pipelines for different downstream applications.},

The combination of technology and English teaching has become a trend, and the traditional teaching methods are being changed by technology. The contradiction between traditional teaching methods and modern oral English teaching needs is becoming increasingly prominent. The development of artificial intelligence technology will help to solve this contradiction. Therefore, the oral English teaching assistant system based on artificial intelligence is designed. The general design part of the system adopts the idea of hierarchical architecture for the overall design, system functional structure design, oral evaluation model design, data storage and use, etc. in the functional structure design, combined with the needs analysis, the account system module, class management module, teaching management module, learning statistics module, notification module and use help are designed respectively, Each functional module complements each other. By means of engineering, combining AI abilities such as oral English evaluation and image retrieval with oral English teaching, we can solve the disadvantages of traditional oral English teaching and establish a new teaching form for oral English Teaching in primary schools.},

  abstract = {Game engines are primarily designed for the development of video games but can also be used as rendering engines for 2D and 3D graphics. They include all relevant libraries and supported programs. Developers can use them to construct games for game consoles and other types of computer softwares. They also aid in the porting of games to multiple platforms. Developers look for platforms which are easily available and provide facilities to create impressive, interesting and animated games. But these software are difficult to run on everyday machines, especially laptops, limiting their use to professionals with dedicated systems. This paper discusses design of new game engine with all the standard features of a rendering engine. The artificial intelligence (AI) aspect of the engine requires rendering of visual data at a lower resolution to improve performance and then using trained Deep Networks to upscale the image to the native resolution of the user's monitor. The AI will ensure that upscaling will be adding detail rather than averaging the nearby pixels.CCS CONCEPTS • Software and its engineering • Software creation and management • Designing software • Software implementation planning • Software design techniques},

  abstract = {Recent generative models show impressive results in photo-realistic image generation. However, artifacts often inevitably appear in the generated results, leading to downgraded user experience and reduced performance in downstream tasks. This work aims to develop a plugin post-processing module for diverse generative models, which can faithfully restore images from diverse generative artifacts. This is challenging because: (1) Unlike traditional degradation patterns, generative artifacts are non-linear and the transformation function is highly complex. (2) There are no readily available artifact-image pairs. (3) Different from model-specific anti-artifact methods, a model-agnostic framework views the generator as a black-box machine and has no access to the architecture details. In this work, we first design a group of mechanisms to simulate generative artifacts of popular generators (i.e., GANs, autoregressive models, and diffusion models), given real images. Second, we implement the model-agnostic anti-artifact framework as an image-to-image diffusion model, due to its advantage in generation quality and capacity. Finally, we design a conditioning scheme for the diffusion model to enable both blind and non-blind image restoration. A guidance parameter is also introduced to allow for a trade-off between restoration accuracy and image quality. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches on the proposed datasets and real-world artifact images.},

  abstract = {Recently, Indonesia's tax ratio well be only 10.1\% of the gross domestic product (GDP), below the average Asia-Pacific country ratio of 19.1\%, indicating a lower level of tax compliance. Therefore, it is necessary to develop tax technology to create a quality tax administration system with a high level of effectiveness and efficiency. This helps alleviate the problems faced by taxpayers, including creating integrated database management with guaranteed integrity. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that can be used for this development. The purpose of this study is to analyze Indonesia's readiness to implement AI in tax technology development. This study also aims to analyze the supporting factors, constraints, and challenges faced in implementing this AI technology. The research method used is qualitative with a phenomenological approach. The data were obtained through in-depth interviews with IT experts, tax consultants, tax officials, and corporate taxpayers, as well as a review of various related documents. The results of this study indicate a positive response to efforts to implement AI in tax technology development in Indonesia. The implementation of AI provide convenience and simplify the tax administration system, thereby increasing tax compliance. AI also assists tax officers in conducting tax audits as well as monitoring taxpayers for all forms of tax evasion. The use of the National Identity Number (NIK) as the Taxpayer Identification Number (NPWP) can be considered a factor that supports the implementation of AI in Indonesian taxation. Several countries have also implemented AI-based tax technology that can be used as a reference for tax implementations in Indonesia. However, the government must pay attention to the obstacles and challenges it faces, namely sophisticated and reliable technological infrastructure, maximum security and control systems to protect taxpayer privacy data, special regulations regarding AI in taxation, and approval from various parties, especially the Ministry of Finance. The next challenge is socialization and an approach to taxpayers regarding the implementation of AI in Indonesian taxation.},

  abstract = {In the context of artificial intelligence technology application, based on cognitive appraisal theory of stress, this study collected 368 samples by means of a questionnaire incorporating negative emotion and organizational support, and analyzed the conditional process of artificial intelligence technology disruption awareness affecting employees’ turnover intention using a cascade regression method. The results of the study showed that artificial intelligence technology disruption awareness positively affects employees’ turnover intention and the process was achieved through the mediating effect of negative emotion. Organizational support moderates the relationship between negative emotion and turnover intention, the higher the organizational support, the more it inhibits the facilitative effect of negative emotion on turnover intention.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the widespread popularity of Internet of things (IoT). By providing sufficient data for model training and inference, IoT has promoted the development of artificial intelligence (AI) to a great extent. Under this background and trend, the traditional cloud computing model may nevertheless encounter many problems in independently tackling the massive data generated by IoT and meeting corresponding practical needs. In response, a new computing model called edge computing (EC) has drawn extensive attention from both industry and academia. With the continuous deepening of the research on EC, however, scholars have found that traditional (non-AI) methods have their limitations in enhancing the performance of EC. Seeing the successful application of AI in various fields, EC researchers start to set their sights on AI, especially from a perspective of machine learning, a branch of AI that has gained increased popularity in the past decades. In this article, we first explain the formal definition of EC and the reasons why EC has become a favorable computing model. Then, we discuss the problems of interest in EC. We summarize the traditional solutions and hightlight their limitations. By explaining the research results of using AI to optimize EC and applying AI to other fields under the EC architecture, this article can serve as a guide to explore new research ideas in these two aspects while enjoying the mutually beneficial relationship between AI and EC.},

  abstract = {To discuss the application of artificial intelligence (AI) speech synthesis technology and wireless network technology in English listening teaching, firstly, the present situation of English listening teaching is analyzed. Secondly, a questionnaire is designed to investigate the feasibility of AI speech synthesis technology in English listening teaching. Finally, the control group (a traditional mode of English listening teaching) and experimental group (AI speech synthesis technology) are set up, compared, and analyzed. The survey shows that for natural fluency, speech synthesis has the lowest score. The textbook audio score is the highest, with an average score of 4.23. According to the mean opinion score (MOS), the AI speech synthesis technology belongs to high-quality speech coding. Therefore, the English audio generated by combining AI speech synthesis technology under wireless network technology also has high quality. Meanwhile, 113 people in the survey consider that the clear articulation of the synthesized audio is full marks, which is clearer than the English audio matching the textbook, indicating that students think the English audio of the supporting textbook is poor in the clear articulation, which affects students’ listening. Moreover, the English listening scores of the experimental group are notably better than those of the control group. It is hoped that the traditional teaching mode can be better integrated with wireless networks and AI technology, thereby improving the clarity of English listening, providing mobile learning, and advancing students' English performance and learning efficiency.},

Thus, we raise a specific research question: would an LLM-based system be able to search for relevant GUI layouts? To address this question, we conducted a controlled study evaluating how Instigator, an LLM-based system for searching GUI layouts of web pages by generative pre-trained training, would return GUI layouts that are relevant to a given instruction and what would be the user experience of (N =34) practitioners interacting with Instigator. Our results identify a very high similarity and a moderate correlation between the rankings of the GUI layouts generated by Instigator and the rankings of the practitioners with respect to their relevance to a given design instruction. We highlight the results obtained through thirteen UEQ+ scales that characterize the user experience of the practitioner with Instigator, which we use to discuss perspectives for improving such future tools.},

  abstract = {This article aims to explore the consistency between a few popular generative AI robots in the evaluation of e-learning platforms. The three robots adopted in the study were GPT-4, Sage, and Dragonfly, which were requested to award rating scores to the six major dimensions, namely (1) features and capabilities, (2) ease of use and customization, (3) cost, (4) security, (5) customer support, and (6) scalability, of 10 to 20 currently most popular e-learning platforms. For each of the three robots, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the rating scores for each of the six dimensions were computed across all the e-learning platforms. The rating score difference for each of the six dimensions between any pair of robots was calculated for each platform. The mean of the absolute value, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the differences for each dimensions between each pair of robots were calculated across all platforms. Finally, a Cronbach alpha coefficient of the rating scores was computed for each of the six dimensions between all the three robots across all the e-learning platforms. The computational results were to reveal whether the three robots accorded discrimination in evaluating each dimension across the platforms and whether there was consistency between the three robots in evaluating each dimension across the platforms. Among some auxiliary results, it was found that the evaluation by the three robots was severely inconsistent for the two dimensions cost and security, inconsistent to a lesser extent for the dimension scalability, and consistent for the remaining three dimensions.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI), and in particular generative models, are transformative tools for knowledge work. They problematise notions of creativity, originality, plagiarism, the attribution of credit, and copyright ownership. Critics of generative models emphasise the reliance on large amounts of training data, and view the output of these models as no more than randomised plagiarism, remix, or collage of the source data. On these grounds many have argued for stronger regulations on the deployment, use, and attribution of the output of these models. However, these issues are not new or unique to artificial intelligence. In this position paper, using examples from literary criticism, the history of art, and copyright law, I show how creativity and originality resist definition as a notatable or information-theoretic property of an object, and instead can be seen as the property of a process, an author, or a viewer. Further alternative views hold that all creative work is essentially reuse (mostly without attribution), or that randomness itself can be creative. I suggest that creativity is ultimately defined by communities of creators and receivers, and the deemed sources of creativity in a workflow often depend on which parts of the workflow can be automated. Using examples from recent studies of AI in creative knowledge work, I suggest that AI shifts knowledge work from material production to critical integration. This position paper aims to begin a conversation around a more nuanced approach to the problems of creativity and credit assignment for generative models, one which more fully recognises the importance of the creative and curatorial voice of the users of these models, and moves away from simpler notational or information-theoretic views.},

Despite a growing international body of research in this area, my scoping review highlights that many aspects of these topics have yet to be explored, particularly in the context of post-primary students in Ireland. My study will begin to bridge this gap by exploring how a purposeful sample of LCCS post-primary students in Ireland engage with GAI tools, such as ChatGPT, during their initial experiences learning Python programming. These findings, when approached through the lens of Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence (HCAI), can help enhance pedagogical strategies and lead to improved learning experiences for students.},

  abstract = {The application of pretrained language models in real-world business domains has gained significant attention. However, research on the practical use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to address real-world downstream tasks is limited. This study aims to enhance the routine tasks of customer service (CS) representatives, particularly in the finance domain, by applying a fine-tuning method to dialogue summarization in CS centers. KakaoBank handles an average of 15,000 CS calls daily. By employing a fine-tuning method using real-world CS dialogue data, we can reduce the time required to summarize CS dialogues and standardize summarization skills. To ensure effective dialogue summarization in the finance domain, pretrained language models should acquire additional knowledge and skills, such as specific knowledge of financial products, problem-solving abilities, and the capacity to handle emotionally charged customers. In this study, we developed a reference fine-tuned model using Polyglot-Ko (5.8B) as the baseline PLM and a dataset containing a wide range of zero-shot instructions and partially containing summarization instructions. We compared this reference model with another model fine-tuned using KakaoBank’s CS dialogues and summarization data as the instruct dataset. The results demonstrated that the fine-tuned model based on KakaoBank’s internal datasets outperformed the reference model, showing a 199\% and 12\% improvement in ROUGE-L and RDASS, respectively. This study emphasizes the significance of task-specific fine-tuning using appropriate instruct datasets for effective performance in specific downstream tasks. Considering its practical use, we suggest that fine-tuning using real-world instruct datasets is a powerful and cost-effective technique for developing generative AI in the business domain.},

This approach involves multiple stakeholders, such as researchers, developers, business leaders, policy makers, and users, who are affected in various ways by the implementation and evaluation of AI systems. The primary focus of the First Workshop on User Perspectives in Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence (HCAI4U) is to examine the potential positive and negative impacts of automated decision-making systems on end-users, as well as how their interaction with AI is influenced by human-centred aspects of reliability, safety, and fairness. The workshop aims to facilitate discussion and exchange of ideas among the community on advances in developing trustworthy, fair, and privacy-preserving systems, as well as user interfaces that are explainable, with a specific focus on the users’ perception in real-world scenarios rather than solely on the algorithmic and model performance. Additionally, HCAI4U aims to foster cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary discussions between experts from various research fields, such as computer science, psychology, sociology, law, medicine, business, etc., to discuss problems and synergies in this exciting research topic.},

  abstract = {Technologies based on AI/ML are playing an increasingly prominent role in teenagers’ everyday lives. Mirroring this trend is a concomitant interest in teaching young people about intelligent technologies. Whereas previous research in the field of Child–Computer Interaction has proposed curriculum and learning activities that describe what teenagers need to learn about AI/ML, there is still a shortage of studies which specifically address teenager-centered perspectives in the teaching of AI/ML. This paper presents a study of teenagers’ everyday understanding of AI/ML technologies. Using a thematic analysis of the teenagers’ own explanations during a series of workshops, we present a conceptual map of the teenagers’ understandings of these technologies. We go on to propose five general recommendations for the teaching of AI/ML to teenagers through the lens of Computational Empowerment. Taken together, these recommendations serve as a teenage-centered starting point for teaching young people about intelligent technologies, an approach that can be implemented in future research interventions with similar objectives.},

  abstract = {The demand of social life for automatic recognition of food images is increasing. Food images have the characteristics of diverse forms, small differences between classes and large differences within classes, which has the problem of high recognition difficulty. This paper proposes a food image recognition method based on generative self-supervised learning. Firstly, we use a BEiT based pre-training model which is trained through generative self-monitoring learning method as the feature extraction network to extract the global semantics and local detail features of food images. And then we fine-tune the fully connected network MLP for classification and recognition through supervised learning method. The model is tested on the current mainstream public food image dataset Food-101, and the top-1 accuracy of 85.99\% is obtained. The experimental results show that this method can significantly reduce the computation of pixel level expression as well as extract the global and detailed features of the image, achieving quite good food image classification and recognition effect. Our method has good robustness, generalization and flexibility, which has practical application value.},

  abstract = {This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. Following a successful workshop in 2022, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

The continuous enhancement in the quality of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC), including but not limited to images and text, is forging new paradigms for its application, particularly within the domain of Augmented Reality (AR). Nevertheless, the application of GenAI within the AR design process remains opaque. This paper aims to articulate a design space encapsulating a series of criteria and a prototypical process to aid practitioners in assessing the aptness of adopting pertinent technologies. The proposed model has been formulated based on a synthesis of design insights garnered from ten experts, obtained through focus group interviews. Leveraging these initial insights, we delineate potential applications of GenAI in AR.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of studies use gender information to un-derstand phenomena such as gender bias, inequity in access and participation, or the impact of the Covid pandemic response. Un-fortunately, most datasets do not include self-reported gender in-formation, which makes it necessary for researchers to infer gen-der from other information, such as from names or names and country information. In this paper, we compare the performance of the new generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT with three traditional commercially available list-based and ma-chine learning-based gender inference tools—Namsor, Gender-API, and genderize.io—on a unique dataset. Specifically, we use a large Olympic athlete dataset and report how variations in the input (e.g., first name and first \&amp; last name, with and without country information) impact the accuracy of their predictions. We find that Namsor is the best traditional commercially available tool. However, ChatGPT performs at least as well as Namsor and often outper-forms it, especially for the female sample when country and/or last name information is available. We conclude ChatGPT may be a cost-effective tool for gender prediction.},

Being trained on this unique dataset enables the AI to generate new and innovative sneaker designs that draw inspiration from the archive and pay homage to the rich history of the adidas brand. AI Archive has been rolled out to our designers as a web application in 2022. The tool has since established itself as an essential ingredient in the concept-to-prototype process of many of our designers. The proposed system gives users a high level of control over the design process, enabling them to precisely guide the AI to create designs according to their direction.

However, most of existing works merely focus on the correlations between user preferences and predicted items, ignoring the essential correlations among items in the next basket, which often results in over-homogenization of predicted items. In this work, we presents a Generative next-basket Recommendation model (GenRec), a novel NBR paradigm that generates the recommended items one by one to form the next basket via an autoregressive decoder. This generative NBR paradigm contributes to capturing and considering item correlations inside each baskets in both training and serving. Moreover, we jointly consider user’s both item- and basket-level contextual information to better capture user’s multi-granularity preferences. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

This study identifies three technological capabilities—sensing, analytics, and controlling—as building blocks of an AIoT system and then proposes four value creation models that configure the building blocks differently. This research analyzes four use cases of AIoT systems deployed in the public transport sector that match the value creation models. Based on the analysis of the use cases, this study identifies critical success factors for public AIoT applications and makes recommendations to government leaders for creating public value through the effective deployment of AIoT systems. It concludes with discussion of limitations and future research areas.},

  abstract = {With the support and promotion of big data and cloud computing, AI has penetrated into every field of people's lives more and more deeply, with its characteristics of sustainable work, extremely fast computing speed, and a certain intelligence. This is an effective way to solve the general lack of demand and productivity of visual design, and relieve the pressure off designers to deal with relatively low-quality and high-demand designs. Therefore, the combination of design and artificial intelligence technology is a necessity. Research on the application of artificial intelligence technology for visual design is also in full swing at home and abroad However, at present, teams at home and abroad are in the exploratory stage. This paper considers whether it is possible to build an intelligent visual design and creation system by using artificial intelligence technology to help graphic communication designers achieve high-quality, high-efficiency, and high-quantity design output. Additionally, this paperexplores how to combine artificial intelligence technology with designers' design workflow so as to form a complementary human-computer cooperation mode. We will explore how to integrate AI technology with designers' design workflow and then create a human-machine collaboration model with complementary advantages to achieve the high quality, high efficiency, and high quantity of design output required by the intelligent visual design creation system being built. Finally, a basic framework of a generative smart human-computer collaborative visual design creation system based on a subset of neural network expert systems in multiple domains and an aggregate of different modules supported by the system is formed, and the working principle and usage process of the system are further elaborated with the example of packaging design.},

  abstract = {In this paper we hope to identify how the typical or standard artificial intelligence development process encourages or facilitates the creation of racialized technologies. We begin by understanding Sylvia Wynter's definition of the biocentric Man genre and its exclusion of Blackness from humanness. We follow this with outlining what we consider to be the typical steps for developing an AI-based technology, which we've broken down into 6 stages: identifying a problem, development process and management tool selection, dataset development and data processing, model development, deployment and risk assessment, and integration and monitoring. The goal of this paper is to better understand how Wynter's biocentric Man is being represented and reinforced by the technologies we are producing in the AI lifecycle and by the lifecycle itself; we hope to identify ways in which the distinction of Blackness from the ‘ideal’ human leads to perpetual punishment at the hands of these technologies. By deconstructing this development process, we can potentially identify ways in which humans in general have not been prioritized and how those affects are disproportionately affecting marginalized people. We hope to offer solutions that will encourage changes in the AI development cycle.},

The agricultural land is gradually reducing in most of the country and it is nearly impossible to increase it back again. Agricultural automation is the only option for precision farming in today’s era and is also the demand of today’s time. Artificial Intelligence (AI) have started contributing and capitalizing on precision farming and all industries long back. The use of digital technologies has revolutionized agriculture, which is helpful for precision farming by providing smart interfaces that can guide small farmers for new crops. Profitable crops and provide solutions for their crops-related queries. The important application of AI is to achieve a better yield, as well as to increase the quality of the crop, detection of diseases, weeds control, pest detection, an application of fertilizer at the right time, greenhouse, cultivation, crop health monitoring etc. These aspects have been discussed in this article. The main objective of this paper is how agriculture is being operated with digital technology in the field of agriculture. Through this paper, those researches have been observed, and the major applications that have been made so far in the field of agricultural science are to be identified with the help of AI.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence is actively researched in various fields such as image recognition, image detection, audio recognition, natural language processing, face expression recognition, and facial expression generation. If we want to create artificial intelligence in the original sense, it will be necessary to integrate these many research results and create a system that can exactly imitate the functions of the human brain. Commercially, the current situation is that integrated AI such as Ameria [2], Uneeq [3], Neon [13], LaMDA [29] and the system using GPT-3 [9] have entered the market. However, there is no research that creates integrated AI with open source in the academic field. This work is an attempt to construct such an integrated AI as an academic research which is in an form of open source. Furthermore, this work is described in a form of multi-processing job with socket connection. Then, execution of the program can be accomplished by multiple computers. For the visual input, object detection is performed by Redman’s YOLO [14]. Next, the system accomplishes Image2text which generates sentences describing the image [34]. The system recognizes the meaning of visual input. As for speech recognition, the question and answering task is activated, and it is possible to give an accurate answer to the question through the microphone [7]. In addition, text generation enables this system to respond to human chattering [5]. This work combines four different sources: visual, text, audio, and scraping outworld news sources. We believe that attempts like this work will become more common in future AI studies.},

  abstract = {Aiming at the problems of low detection and tracking accuracy, poor robustness and inaccurate vehicle flow statistics of multi-vehicle types in surveillance video, an artificial intelligence-based vehicle detection and tracking method was proposed. This method reconstructed the feature extraction network of the target detection model YOLOv5s to enhance the extraction of important features of the target and improve the detection accuracy of the detector. Firstly, Swin Transformer module is introduced into the Backbone network to replace part of C3 modules in the original algorithm, so as to enhance the global modeling ability of the model, better capture the context feature information, and expand the model's receptive field. Then, by comparing different attention mechanisms, NAM attention is selected to access the Neck network to enhance the cross-dimensional interaction between the channel and spatial dimensions of information, reduce information loss and enhance the performance of the network. Finally, the feature extraction network part of the DeepSort algorithm was optimized and retrained on the vehicle rerecognition data set to make it more suitable for vehicle tracking. The experimental results show that the accuracy of vehicle detection by the improved YOLOv5s is increased by 1.93 percentage points compared with the original algorithm. Combined with the DeepSort algorithm, the accuracy of vehicle flow statistics under different lighting conditions such as daytime, evening and night can reach 97.2\%, 97.5\% and 80.4\% respectively.},

  abstract = {The human race is facing one of the most meaningful public health emergencies in the modern era caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic introduced various challenges, from lock-downs with significant economic costs to fundamentally altering the way of life for many people around the world. The battle to understand and control the virus is still at its early stages yet meaningful insights have already been made. The uncertainty of why some patients are infected and experience severe symptoms, while others are infected but asymptomatic, and others are not infected at all, makes managing this pandemic very challenging. Furthermore, the development of treatments and vaccines relies on knowledge generated from an ever evolving and expanding information space. Given the availability of digital data in the modern era, artificial intelligence (AI) is a meaningful tool for addressing the various challenges introduced by this unexpected pandemic. Some of the challenges include: outbreak prediction, risk modeling including infection and symptom development, testing strategy optimization, drug development, treatment repurposing, vaccine development, and others.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) in drug discovery is a rapidly evolving field that combines computational methods with biological knowledge and applications. Traditionally, the process of developing a new drug has been time-consuming and expensive, spanning several years and costing billions of dollars. The emergence of AI technologies offers the potential to significantly reduce both the timeline and cost involved in this critical endeavour. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that AI applications in pharmacy and drug discovery require a high degree of interpretability and transparency. The integration of domain knowledge into AI models becomes paramount to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the generated results. In light of these considerations, we propose a workshop on "Knowledge-enhanced Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery (KAIDD)." This workshop aims to explore the profound impact of incorporating various knowledge databases into the development of explainable AI models for drug discovery. Participants will have the opportunity to delve into cutting-edge research, methodologies, and practical applications that leverage the fusion of AI techniques with domain-specific knowledge. Authors of accepted papers will have the opportunity to submit extended versions of their work for a full-paper review process and potential publication in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.},

In order to reveal the value-added results of AI implementation, this study adopts an event study methodology to capture the abnormal returns resulting from the announcement of AI implementation. Based on the empirical results of this study, in response to the announcement of AI implementation, we find significant positive abnormal returns on the event day. With respect to the grouping analysis, the results show significant differences in average cumulative abnormal returns between announcements with detailed information and those without detailed information. In addition, our findings present significant differences in average cumulative abnormal returns between IT-companies and non-IT companies on the event day. Ultimately, according to the content analysis, only one characteristic, the frequency of negative words, is modestly and negatively correlated with average cumulative abnormal returns.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence has made significant strides, producing text indistinguishable from human prose and remarkably photorealistic images. Automatically measuring how close the generated data distribution is to the target distribution is central to diagnosing existing models and developing better ones. We present MAUVE, a family of comparison measures between pairs of distributions such as those encountered in the generative modeling of text or images. These scores are statistical summaries of divergence frontiers capturing two types of errors in generative modeling. We explore three approaches to statistically estimate these scores: vector quantization, non-parametric estimation, and classifier-based estimation. We provide statistical bounds for the vector quantization approach.Empirically, we find that the proposed scores paired with a range of f-divergences and statistical estimation methods can quantify the gaps between the distributions of humanwritten text and those of modern neural language models by correlating with human judgments and identifying known properties of the generated texts. We demonstrate in the vision domain that MAUVE can identify known properties of generated images on par with or better than existing metrics. In conclusion, we present practical recommendations for using MAUVE effectively with language and image modalities.},

ChatGPT has exceeded expectations in its abilities, leading to extensive considerations of its potential applications and misuse. In this work, we evaluate the influence of ChatGPT on university education, with a primary focus on computer security-oriented specialization. We gather data regarding the effectiveness and usability of this tool for completing exams, programming assignments, and term papers. We evaluate multiple levels of tool misuse, ranging from utilizing it as a consultant to simply copying its outputs. While we demonstrate how easily ChatGPT can be used to cheat, we also discuss the potentially significant benefits to the educational system. For instance, it might be used as an aid (assistant) to discuss problems encountered while solving an assignment or to speed up the learning process. Ultimately, we discuss how computer science higher education should adapt to tools like ChatGPT.},

  abstract = {“AI as a Service” (AIaaS) is a rapidly growing market, offering various plug-and-play AI services and tools. AIaaS enables its customers (users)—who may lack the expertise, data, and/or resources to develop their own systems—to easily build and integrate AI capabilities into their applications. Yet, it is known that AI systems can encapsulate biases and inequalities that can have societal impact. This paper argues that the context-sensitive nature of fairness is often incompatible with AIaaS’ ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach, leading to issues and tensions. Specifically, we review and systematise the AIaaS space by proposing a taxonomy of AI services based on the levels of autonomy afforded to the user. We then critically examine the different categories of AIaaS, outlining how these services can lead to biases or be otherwise harmful in the context of end-user applications. In doing so, we seek to draw research attention to the challenges of this emerging area.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a fast-growing technology, well known for generating high-quality design drawings and images in seconds with a simple text input. However, users often feel uncertain about whether generative art should be considered created by AI or by themselves. Losing the sense of ownership of the outcome might impact the learning process and confidence of novice designers and design learners who seek to benefit from using Generative Design Tools. In this context, we propose OwnDiffusion, a design pipeline that utilizes Generative AI to assist in the physical prototype ideation process for novice product designers and industrial design learners while preserving their sense of ownership. The pipeline incorporates a prompt weight assessing tool, allowing designers to fine-tune the AI’s input based on their sense of ownership. We envision this method as a solution for AI-assisted design, enabling designers to maintain confidence in their creativity and ownership of a design.},

Less than a decade ago, it was thought that creative work would be among the last to be automated&nbsp;– yet today, we see AI encroaching on many creative domains. In this paper, we present the findings of a survey study on people’s perceptions of text-to-image generation. We touch on participants’ technical understanding of the emerging technology, their fears and concerns, and thoughts about risks and dangers of text-to-image generation to the individual and society. We find that while participants were aware of the risks and dangers associated with the technology, only few participants considered the technology to be a personal risk. The risks for others were more easy to recognize for participants. Artists were particularly seen at risk. Interestingly, participants who had tried the technology rated its future importance lower than those who had not tried it. This result shows that many people are still oblivious of the potential personal risks of generative artificial intelligence and the impending societal changes associated with this technology.},

With generative artificial intelligence, conventional phishing detection advice such as looking out for linguistic errors and bad layouts will become obsolete. New approaches to improve people’s ability to detect phishing are essential. We report on promising results from two experiments (total N = 183) that engaging people with an adversarial mindset improves their ability to detect phishing e-mails compared to those who received conventional or no training. Participants who completed conventional training were nearly three times as likely to fall for a simulated phishing attack compared to those who completed the adversarial training, in which they watched a fictitious cybercriminal explain how to devise a targeted phishing e-mail, and then wrote targeted phishing e-mails themselves. Although further research is needed to examine the training’s long-term efficacy with larger sample sizes, the present findings show an encouraging alternative to conventional phishing training approaches.},

The control system of a Pressure Oxidation facility was evaluated to determine potential opportunities for the integration of Artificial Intelligence. Several challenges were identified during the start-up operations of the Autoclave including typographical errors, possible non-compliance with Standard Operating Procedures, and the need for expertise to manage the operations. These conditions satisfy the need to explore an AI system that can potentially minimize human intervention. Through related reviews, this study suggested a hybrid approach through incorporation of safe oxygen operation limits as part of supervised learning and to develop predictive models using historical data to predict the optimal oxygen requirement to achieve maximum oxidation results thereby making the POX process an ideal candidate for Artificial Intelligence system integration. A data flow diagram and user interface prototype were developed to illustrate the role of the proposed Artificial Intelligence system in controlling the Autoclave, which can significantly minimize human errors that can potentially improve safety and boost productivity.},

  abstract = {A stable supply of electrical energy is essential for the functioning of our society. Therefore, energy and balancing markets of power grids are strictly regulated. With changes in technology, the economy and society, these regulations are also constantly adapted. However, whether these regulatory changes lead to the intended results is not easy to assess. Could eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models distinguish regulatory settings and support the understanding of the effects of these changes? In this article, we explore two examples of regulatory changes: The splitting of the German-Austrian bidding zone and changes in the pricing schemes of the German balancing energy market. We find that boosted tree models and feedforward neural networks before and after a regulatory change differ in their respective parametrizations. Using Shapley additive explanations, we reveal model differences, e.g., in terms of feature importance, and identify key features of these distinct models. With this study, we demonstrate how XAI can be applied to investigate system changes in power systems.},

The impacts of AI components on the design and use of application systems are evolving rapidly as improved deep learning techniques and fresh big data sources afford effective and efficient solutions for broad ranges of applications. New goals and requirements for Human-AI System (HAIS) functions and qualities are emerging, whereas the boundaries between human and machine behaviors continue to blur. This research commentary identifies and addresses the design science research (DSR) challenges facing the field of Information Systems as the demand for human-machine synergies in Human-Artificial Intelligence Systems surges in all application areas. The design challenges of HAIS are characterized by a taxonomy of eight C's - composition, complexity, creativity, confidence, controls, conscience, certification, and contribution. By applying a design science research frame to structure and investigate HAIS design, implementation, use, and evolution, we propose a forward-thinking agenda for relevant and rigorous information systems research contributions.},

First, they added local sections to the mapping, and then manually completed branch direction and spacing adjustment, equipment marking, etc. The whole process requires a lot of manual participation, so there are unfavorable factors such as slow mapping efficiency, large manual adjustment workload, and long implementation period. Based on this, this paper proposes an automatic mapping scheme of electrical system diagram based on artificial intelligence algorithm.

In this paper, based on the combined load data of wind, light and electricity in a northwest region of China, the generator network formulates the unit output plan after the fault occurs. Based on the information of actual power load and actual new energy output before and after the fault, aiming at minimizing the system power generation cost, and considering the constraints of safe operation of the system, an expert system generation fault recovery strategy for this grid fault is formed. It is found that the fault recovery strategy in the early stage of training is quite different from the fault recovery strategy generated by expert system, and the error value is large. With the complete training of the generative adversarial network, the fault recovery auxiliary decision-making scheme approaching the fault recovery expert system can be given in various load and new energy output scenarios, and the error between the two is maintained within 5 \%. The research on power grid fault recovery strategy based on generative adversarial imitation learning network model shows the autonomous and safe fault recovery ability of force control system.},

  abstract = {Under the background of the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, the education and teaching methods supported by technology promote the emergence and development of new forms of education, and point out the way for the reform of education in the new era. The human-machine collaborative teaching in the era of artificial intelligence not only contributes to the digital transformation of practical education, but also helps to promote the high-level application of education informatization. Based on this, this paper predicts the future development trend of human-machine collaboration, based on the development process of human-machine collaboration, and expounds the basic connotation of human-machine collaboration teaching. Subsequently, this study analyzes the core competencies of humans and machines and the characteristics and differences of artificial intelligence and teachers, and the framework of human-machine collaborative teaching system and human-machine collaborative classroom teaching are established to provide theoretical support for human-machine collaborative teaching.},

  abstract = {Using the association rules among both data mining (DM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, this paper proposes concepts and techniques for enhancing the curriculum environment based on the modernization of the educational field curriculum scheme of Ideological and Political Education (IPE) classes in universities and colleges. The study analyze the inter-subjectivity concept to the model development from the conceptual level, the benchmark value of the whole setting, multidimensional spacetime, and the leading importance of the Internet governance idea to the reformation of IPE in the colleges and universities. The findings assess the issues with IPE transformation and development in colleges and universities and suggest solutions, as well as four mechanisms of "methodical design underlined in the overview, team-work cooperation of team development, augmentation of environmental development, and double endorsement of quality management”. The concept of developing a” three-stage full atmosphere" network IPE architecture for universities and colleges is presented as one of the remedies to enhance the efficiency of the IPE in universities. This idea is based on experience summary, theoretical analysis, and empirical study. The timeliness concerns of IPE transformation in universities and colleges are resolved by using in-depth comprehension and evaluation of the necessary knowledge of DM-AI, which is then used to apply the appropriate DM-AI methodologies. This allows the relevant administrators to quickly learn the crucial data in complicated problems and suggest solutions for subsequent decision-making.},

However, these generative AI applications lack clarity on how they work and operate for their users. Revealing how generative AI tools work enables designers to understand these tools’ limitations and capabilities. We developed a tangible interface with sand as a medium for human-AI co-creation, Sand Playground. It extends the work in human-AI drawing practices beyond two-dimensional digital surfaces. Sand playground has three co-drawing modes, artistic mimicry, zen garden and doodling. We conducted a user study with ten designers. One of our findings is that the interface enabled users to predict the AI agent’s actions. Our research introduces novel insights into the role of tangible interactions and physical interfaces in generative AI literacy and explainability in design tools.},

Cloud environments provide multiple security services that run over a Shared Responsibility Model that requires the participation of the cloud provider and the customer. Thus, this paper proposes an architecture based on Artificial Intelligence to support the finding of system threats and errors in an early stage and on Security Chaos Engineering methodology to reliably test the existence of such errors. This proposed architecture may help orientate better system designs and contribute to building holistic security. A particular use case is described to show how the proposal can be applied to a system that supports services for a military-related organization.},

  abstract = {Under the influence of information, network and intelligent high-speed development situation, China's intelligent technology and other aspects have made great progress and achievements, derived a lot of advanced artificial intelligence technology, machine learning technology and deep learning technology, etc., to promote the development of intelligence and information in major fields. Artificial intelligence deep learning is the fusion of artificial intelligence technology and machine learning technology, which lays the foundation for the reform and innovation of artificial voice intelligent recognition technology and intelligent robot technology. So in order to improve the application level of intelligent speech recognition technology, it is necessary to continuously optimize the speech recognition method based on AI deep learning. In this regard, according to the relevant literature, this paper addresses the problem that phoneme features of varying duration are generated during the propagation of speech signals, and these features affect the correct rate of speech recognition, and the phoneme features of different lengths are standardized based on the deep learning research mentioned in this paper with BLSTM-CTC as an example. By evaluating the model on the Thchs30 and ST-CMDS datasets, the results show that the MCFN-based BLSTM-CTC speech recognition model has a reduced recognition word error rate compared with the traditional speech recognition model.},

  abstract = {Tasks are central to information retrieval (IR) and drive interactions with search systems [2, 4, 10]. Understanding and modeling tasks helps these systems better support user needs [8, 9, 11]. This keynote focuses on search tasks, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the implications of recent work at their intersection for the future of search. Recent estimates suggest that half of Web search queries go unanswered, many of them connected to complex search tasks that are ill-defined or multi-step and span several queries[6]. AI copilots, e.g., ChatGPT and Bing Chat, are emerging to address complex search tasks and many other challenges. These copilots are built on large foundation models such as GPT-4 and are being extended with skills and plugins. Copilots broaden the surface of tasks achievable via search, moving toward creation not just finding (e.g., interview preparation, email composition), and can make searchers more efficient and more successful.Users currently engage with AI copilots via natural language queries and dialog and the copilots generate answers with source attribution [7]. However, in delegating responsibility for answer generation, searchers also lose some control over aspects of the search process, such as directly manipulating queries and examining lists of search results [1]. The efficiency gains from auto-generating a single, synthesized answer may also reduce opportunities for user learning and serendipity. A wholesale move to copilots for all search tasks is neither practical nor necessary: model inference is expensive, conversational interfaces are unfamiliar to many users in a search context, and traditional search already excels for many types of task. Instead, experiences that unite search and chat are becoming more common, enabling users to adjust the modality and other aspects (e.g., answer tone) based on the task.The rise of AI copilots creates many opportunities for IR, including aligning generated answers with user intent, tasks, and applications via human feedback [3]; understanding copilot usage, including functional fixedness [5]; using context and data to tailor responses to people and situations (e.g., grounding, personalization); new search experiences (e.g., unifying search and chat); reliability and safety (e.g., accuracy, bias); understanding impacts on user learning and agency; and evaluation (e.g., model-based feedback, searcher simulations [12] repeatability). Research in these and related areas will enable search systems to more effectively utilize new copilot technologies together with traditional search to help searchers better tackle a wider variety of tasks.},

We then revisit human augmentation as an alternative to user friendliness that seems particularly relevant in the areas of inclusive design and artificial intelligence. Viewing human-AI interaction as a kind of human augmentation raises issues such as how to promote trust and situation awareness. We also pose the question: Can HCI and human factors engineering work together to solve the increasingly urgent challenges of human-AI technology? In an initial look at this question, we contrast the different approaches of HCI and human factors on emerging AI research. This article concludes by considering other potentially promising paths for HCI. We propose more collaboration between HCI and human factors, or related disciplines, in the future to address the massive challenges posed by the rapid growth in data science and artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {Machine intelligence relies on Al (artificial intelligence) trainers, workers who perform labor such as data annotation and algorithm optimization. However, the promise of Al does not often benefit workers equally; instead, it puts them in precarious situations, such as low wages and subordination to machines. My dissertation takes an interdisciplinary approach to draw attention to these pressing issues by exploring the sociotechnical, cultural, and economic dimensions of this emergent technology-mediated labor in the context of large data infrastructures. My arguments and proposed concepts (e.g., sociotechnical/algorithmic mobility) respond directly to the under-theorization of mobility research and ecologically unequal exchange theory in HCI. In my dissertation, I argue that the Al trainers, who often work in developing regions of western China, are shouldering the burdens of (1) alleviating China’s poverty through Al for development programs, (2) sustaining Eastern China’s platform economy as key participants in large-scale data infrastructure projects, and (3) promoting global Al advancement by providing disembodied labor on products such as high-quality training datasets through repetitive and low-paying work. Using multi-sited ethnography and participatory design methods, my dissertation describes the experiences of under-resourced and under-studied Al trainer communities and the effects of AI on them. It will also offer context-sensitive design recommendations for supporting emergent technology-mediated labor and policy interventions for ethical and sustainable Al training practices.},

In the architectural sector, it is possible to observe the first tangible results of the implementation of new increasingly autonomous digital processes that support the design and approval of a project, although it is still at an embryonic stage. The new limits of the expansion of AI systems enabled by digital transformation require careful consideration of the impact of new technologies in redefining the role of the designer in decision making. Even if a full design action cannot be mentioned yet, it is predicted that artificial intelligence can develop into an algorithm that can learn the design action with new algorithms and new hardware in the future. In parallel with the development of artificial intelligence and technologies, the discipline of architecture will constantly transform and develop.},

Generative technologies are developing rapidly and many designers are using them. Yet, there remains little published work on the use of GenAI in design. Our goal is to not only showcase the potential of GenAI for design, but to engage in discussions of its shortcomings and opportunities as they have been already articulated by scholars. By synthesizing both published and unpublished works, we will develop best practices, ethical considerations, and future research directions for the use of GenAI in design. We will explore a range of topics and themes, including leveraging the characteristics of GenAI for design, mapping the diverse applications of GenAI in design, envisioning a framework for design, and guiding future work on GenAI in design research. Ultimately, we hope to provide a roadmap for the integration of GenAI into the design research process and to encourage designers and researchers to explore the potential of GenAI in a thoughtful and deliberate way.},

Designers, as a special user group interacting with AI, have received more attention in the Human-Computer Interaction community. Prior work has discussed emerging challenges that persist in designing for AI. However, few systematic reviews focus on AI for design to understand how designers and AI can augment each other's complementary strengths in design collaboration. In this work, we conducted a landscape analysis of AI for design, via a systematic literature review of 93 papers. The analysis first provides a bird's eye view of overall patterns in this area. The analysis also reveals three themes interpreted from the paper corpus associated with AI for design, including AI assisting designers, designers assisting AI, and characterizing designer-AI collaboration. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggested methodological proposals to guide HCI toward research and practices that center on collaborative creativity.},

  abstract = {Resource recycling industries are restricted by the mixed composition of waste, the ratio of recycled material dependent on experience, and the quality inspection relies on physical assessment, resulting in problems such as the inability to optimize manufacturing process parameters and unstable product quality. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly in recent years and adopted in various industries. From literature review, AI is being increasingly used in the resource recycling industry to optimize processes, improve efficiency, and enhance sustainability. This study used machine learning, an AI technology, to conduct model training and identify optimal model validation in Taiwan's resource recycling industry. A case example was implemented to reduce the cost by AI's recommendation of more accurate borax blending ratios. By accepting AI's recommendation of accurate borax blending ratios, it can reduce the non-compliance rate by 45\% and at the same time reduce the raw material usage by approximately 2∼3\%, saving approximately N.T.D. 1-2 million per year. This study pioneered artificial intelligence technology to improve manufacturing process efficiency and optimization of product quality in the resource recycling industry. The empirical results demonstrate that the application of AI technology contributes to the improvement of traditional manufacturing process problems and enhances the industry's overall production efficiency and quality.},

  abstract = {Despite debates about emotion artificial intelligence's (EAI) validity, legality, and social consequences, EAI is increasingly present in the high stakes context of hiring, with potential to shape the future of work and the workforce. The values laden in technology play a significant role in its societal impact.We conducted qualitative content analysis on the public-facing websites (N=229) of EAI hiring services. We identify the organizational problems that EAI hiring services claim to solve and reveal the values emerging in desired EAI uses as promoted by EAI hiring services to solve organizational problems. Our findings show that EAI hiring services market their technologies as technosolutions to three purported organizational hiring problems: 1) hiring (in)accuracy, 2) hiring (mis)fit, and 3) hiring (in)authenticity. We unpack these problems to expose how these desired uses of EAI are legitimized by the corporate ideals of data-driven decision making, continuous improvement, precision, loyalty, and stability. We identify the unfair and deceptive mechanisms by which EAI hiring services claim to solve the purported organizational hiring problems, suggesting that they unfairly exclude and exploit job candidates through EAI's creation, extraction, and affective commodification of a candidate's affective value through pseudoscientific approaches. Lastly, we interrogate EAI hiring service claims to reveal the core values that underpin their stated desired use: techno-omnipresence, techno-omnipotence, and techno-omniscience. We show how EAI hiring services position desired use of their technology as a moral imperative for hiring organizations with supreme capabilities to solve organizational hiring problems, then discuss implications for fairness, ethics, and policy in EAI-enabled hiring within the US policy landscape.},

  abstract = {Although there are methods of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to virtual reality (VR) solutions, there are few studies in the literature. Thus, to fill this gap, we performed a systematic literature review of these methods. In this review, we apply a methodology proposed in the literature that locates existing studies, selects and evaluates contributions, analyses, and synthesizes data. We used Google Scholar and databases such as Elsevier's Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. A set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to select documents. The results showed that when AI methods are used in VR applications, the main advantages are high efficiency and precision of algorithms. Moreover, we observe that machine learning is the most applied AI scientific technique in VR applications. In conclusion, this paper showed that the combination of AI and VR contributes to new trends, opportunities, and applications for human-machine interactive devices, education, agriculture, transport, 3D image reconstruction, and health. We also concluded that the usage of AI in VR provides potential benefits in other fields of the real world such as teleconferencing, emotion interaction, tourist services, and image data extraction.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence, and specifically deep neural networks (DNNs), has rapidly emerged in the past decade as the standard for several tasks from specific advertising to object detection. The performance offered has led DNN algorithms to become a part of critical embedded systems, requiring both efficiency and reliability. In particular, DNNs are subject to malicious examples designed in a way to fool the network while being undetectable to the human observer: the adversarial examples. While previous studies propose frameworks to implement such attacks in black box settings, those often rely on the hypothesis that the attacker has access to the logits of the neural network, breaking the assumption of the traditional black box. In this paper, we investigate a real black box scenario where the attacker has no access to the logits. In particular, we propose an architecture-agnostic attack which solve this constraint by extracting the logits. Our method combines hardware and software attacks, by performing a side-channel attack that exploits electromagnetic leakages to extract the logits for a given input, allowing an attacker to estimate the gradients and produce state-of-the-art adversarial examples to fool the targeted neural network. Through this example of adversarial attack, we demonstrate the effectiveness of logits extraction using side-channel as a first step for more general attack frameworks requiring either the logits or the confidence scores.},

Recognizing the significance of AI, educators are expected not only to teach about AI but also to utilize AI tools in their teaching, ensuring that their students are equipped with the necessary knowledge to navigate the AI-driven society. Thus, it is important to understand how educators perceive AI. In this study, we explore educators’ perceptions of AI, as well as whether they teach AI, the challenges they face in teaching AI, potential support for teaching AI in the future, and possible differences between Cypriot and international educators. Two online surveys, involving 197 educators, followed by interviews with 10 Cypriot educators were conducted to examine how they perceive AI. The findings revealed a shared conceptualization of AI as “human-like”, intelligent machines, capable of learning and solving problems using data. Notable differences in the definitions of AI emerged between Cypriot educators and their international counterparts. Furthermore, the findings showed that even though educators perceive teaching AI as important, they lack formal training and specialized educational tools on AI, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions and tailored resources.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence for Social Good (AI4SG) has emerged as a growing body of research and practice exploring the potential of AI technologies to tackle social issues. This area emphasizes interdisciplinary partnerships with community organizations, such as non-profits and government agencies. However, amidst excitement about new advances in AI and their potential impact, the needs, expectations, and aspirations of these community organizations--and whether they are being met--are not well understood. Understanding these factors is important to ensure that the considerable efforts by AI teams and community organizations can actually achieve the positive social impact they strive for. Drawing on the Data Feminism framework, we explored the perspectives of community organization members on their partnerships with AI teams through 16 semi-structured interviews. Our study highlights the pervasive influence of funding agendas and the optimism surrounding AI's potential. Despite the significant intellectual contributions and labor provided by community organization members, their goals were frequently sidelined in favor of other stakeholders, including AI teams. While many community organization members expected tangible project deployment, only two out of 14 projects we studied reached the deployment stage. However, community organization members sustained their belief in the potential of the projects, still seeing diminished goals as valuable. To enhance the efficacy of future collaborations, our participants shared their aspirations for success, calling for co-leadership starting from the early stages of projects. We propose data co-liberation as a grounding principle for approaching AI4SG moving forward, positing that community organizations' co-leadership is essential for fostering more effective, sustainable, and ethical development of AI.},

Building upon work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), fostering children’s computational thinking skills, this study explores interactions between children (aged 7-13) and GenAI tools through methods of participatory design. We seek to answer two questions: (1) How do children in co-design workshops perceive GenAI tools and their usage for creative works? and (2) How do children navigate the creative process while using GenAI tools? How might these interactions support their confidence in their ability to create? Our findings contribute a model that describes the potential contexts underpinning child-GenAI creative interactions and explores implications of this model for theories of creativity, design, and use of GenAI as a constructionist tool for creative self-efficacy.},

Although people may decide to "go indie" for various purposes, indie game development has become a crucial part of the global gaming culture. However, this community is now facing unprecedented tensions as generative AI technologies are shifting how games can be designed, produced, and experienced. Through a qualitative analysis of 3,091 online posts and comments from subreddits and Facebook groups for indie game developers, we offer an in-depth investigation of how indie game developers perceive and envision the multifaceted role of generative AI in their creative practices. Our empirical investigation reveals that generative AI both promotes and harms indie game developers' endeavors to innovate the traditional game production model, which further influences the nature and workflow of creativity in game development. We also propose three principles for designing future generative AI technologies to improve indie developers' work while mitigating potential risks, harm, and negative impacts of AI. We hope that this study can help design and develop future generative AI technologies to foster and sustain more democratic and inclusive practices in game development rather than replacing human creators.},

With the rapid integration of AI into societal and technological realms, it is essential to understand these pre-instructional conceptions to develop effective AI education programs relevant to students’ everyday experiences. To achieve this, the research employs a phenomenon-oriented and context-based approach, concentrating on six AI systems that students frequently encounter: chatbots, snapchat filters, autonomous cars, voice assistants, search engines, and computer-controlled opponents in video games. An online questionnaire was developed to explore students’ explanations of how these phenomena occur and the characteristics they attribute to AI. The results indicate that students’ pre-instructional conceptions vary only minimally across different educational levels, suggesting uniformity in their basic understanding of AI, which remains superficial without targeted educational interventions. The study’s insights are crucial for designing AI education programs that accurately address and expand upon students’ pre-instructional conceptions based on everyday phenomena, making AI learning more accessible and engaging in their daily lives.},

With the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence technology and its deep integration with the media industry, intelligent algorithms are increasingly being integrated into social life and development processes, thereby becoming a significant determinant influencing human production and livelihood. In the context of the rapid advancement of digital technology, a series of derived risks associated with the "Social Embedding" process of artificial intelligence algorithms have been overlooked by both academia and industry. The paper elaborates on the fundamental structure of embedded in the society in artificial intelligence algorithms, examining them from several perspectives. It identifies various derived risks associated with embedded in the society and proposes a novel model for embedded in the society based on the concept of building a community for social governance. Furthermore, it presents an innovative model for governing AI algorithms within this "Social Governance Community" framework to enhance algorithm governance effectiveness and address derived risks arising from their embedded in the society.},

However, current challenges in vocational colleges include a scarcity of proficient educators specialized in elderly education, necessitating enhancement of professional competencies; a mismatch in resource supply and demand, coupled with low resource utilization efficiency; inadequate technical support, demanding optimization of service quality; simplistic teaching methodologies devoid of modern instructional tools; and an unreasonable curriculum evaluation standard, lacking a dynamic assessment mechanism.In response to these issues, this study meticulously delineates the implementation roadmap for the "Artificial Intelligence + Elderly Education" teaching model, encompassing five core dimensions: defining learning objectives, designing instructional content, innovating teaching methodologies and learning processes, integrating teaching resources, and establishing evaluation and feedback mechanisms. Furthermore, it endeavors to explore practical strategies for leveraging AI to address existing challenges in vocational colleges' endeavors to educate the elderly, thereby offering valuable insights for the sustainable development of geriatric education.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has become increasingly popular, influencing various creative domains. However, while broader societal perspectives have been analyzed, specific examinations of how practitioners utilize GenAI tools to enhance their current workflows remain limited. To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study involving 16 professional designers from the automotive industry. We aimed to identify their challenges with existing GenAI image generation tools in daily design practices. Thematic analysis revealed four key themes: (1) the need for visual input-centric multi-modal interfaces that extend beyond textual prompts, (2) the lack of support for the iterative nature of design processes in GenAI tools, (3) difficulties in controlling prompts to achieve desired outputs, and (4) the significance of incorporating human experiences and emotions into design. Based on our findings, we propose and discuss potential design considerations for enhancing future GenAI image generation tool interfaces.},

  abstract = {Due to changing demographics, limited availability of experts, and frequent job transitions, retaining and sharing knowledge within organizations is crucial. While many learning systems already address this issue, they typically lack automation and scalability in teaching novices and, thus, hinder the learning processes within organizations. Recent research emphasizes the capability of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to make black-box artificial intelligence systems interpretable for decision-makers. This work explores the potential of using (X)AI-based learning systems for providing learning examples and explanations to novices. In an exploratory study, we evaluate novices’ learning performance in a learning setting taking into account their cognitive abilities. Our results show that novices increase their learning performance throughout the exploratory study. These results shed light on how XAI can facilitate learning, taking first steps towards understanding the potential of XAI in learning systems.},

  abstract = {In response to the issues of existing face liveness detection models, such as performance degradation under complex lighting conditions and poor generalization performance across datasets, we propose a 3D Mask Detection Algorithm by introducing attention mechanism and feature fusion methods. This approach is designed based on FlowNet2 and MobileNetV3. Firstly, the improved optical flow model is used to obtain optical flow feature maps, which are then convolved to calculate frames with larger motion trajectories. Weighted allocation is performed for spatial features of multiple frames, followed by spatial feature aggregation. Secondly, the improved MobileNetV3 is employed to process spatio-temporal features and obtain deep features. A feature fusion method based on attention mechanism is used to fuse spatio-temporal features. Finally, the fused features are inputted into a classifier to obtain prediction scores. Compared with classical face liveness detection methods, our model exhibits better detection performance and generalization ability. In experiments on the HiFiMask dataset, the minimum detection error rate is only 2.07\%, outperforming classical detection methods such as CDCN++ and LeTSrPPG. Our face liveness detection method captures the abnormal traces of 3D masks spliced with faces through the optical flow features obtained by the optical flow model and the fusion of spatio-temporal information. This method is insensitive to lighting conditions and performs excellently in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating a certain level of generalization performance.},

It also places fundamental importance on ethical considerations in determining legitimate and illegitimate uses of AI. Organizations that apply ethical AI have clearly stated well-defined review processes to ensure adherence to legal guidelines. Therefore, the wave of research at the intersection of ethical AI in data mining and machine learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and social science. Despite these successes, ethical AI still faces many challenges, such as a lack of interpretable and explainable methods for fairness-aware deep learning models, etc. Consequently, there is an urgent need to bring experts and researchers together at prestigious venues to discuss ethical AI, which has been rarely seen in previous KDD conferences. This workshop will provide a premium platform for both research and industry from different backgrounds to exchange ideas on opportunities, challenges, and cutting-edge techniques in ethical AI.},

In this article, we reflect on the importance of formulating and addressing research problems in software engineering through a socio-technical lens, thus ensuring a holistic understanding of the complex phenomena in this field. We propose a research playbook with the aim of providing a guide to formulate compelling and socially relevant research questions and to identify the appropriate research strategies for empirical investigations, with an eye on the long-term implications of technologies or their use. We showcase how to apply the research playbook. Firstly, we show how it can be used retrospectively to reflect on a prior disruptive technology, Stack Overflow, and its impact on software development. Secondly, we show how it can be used to question the impact of two current disruptive technologies: AI and AR/VR. Finally, we introduce a specialized GPT model to support the researcher in framing future investigations.

Specifically, as changes in the topological structure and unstable communication are likely to cause security problems in communication of drones in the battlefield, two dynamic key update protocols, i.e., topology-aware key update and mutual-healing key update, are put forth here to ensure secure communication through dynamically-updated keys. Analyses reveal that the proposed scheme has forward and backward security and resistance to collusion attacks and replay attacks. Meanwhile, the proposed method has been compared with existing methods through tests on the popular MIRACL dataset by Visual Studio 2019, and the test results show that our method optimizes the computing performance and the communication overhead, and achieves higher updating efficiency.},

  abstract = {As generative artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more common in day-to-day life, AI-generated content (AIGC) needs to be accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. These characteristics typically are determined by subjective, human-based image quality assessment; however, there is limited research on the qualification of AI-generated image quality. Over 9,800 images were generated using Craiyon and OpenAI's DALL-E 2 text-to-image models and evaluated on the three criteria proposed for determining the quality of visual AIGC: (1) the number of objects, (2), resolution (strictly image quality; label/prompt exclusive), and (3) representativeness (consideration for how well the image matches the label/prompt). We observe that the paid, DALL-E 2 model, produced a dataset with fewer objects per image, higher resolution, and higher representativeness compared to Craiyon (free). There is an inverse relationship between the number of objects/images and its resolution and representativeness. This study establishes three subjective metrics for the evaluation of synthetic images to support the creation of more inclusive AIGC.},

  abstract = {Conceptual design is an essential stage in the design process, and its ultimate success largely depends on designers’ creativity. Both physical and digital prototypes are commonly adopted by designers to support ideation and creativity, providing intuitive perception and rapid iteration, respectively. In recent advancements, large-scale generation models are able to offer data-enabled creativity support by generating high-quality solutions comparable to human designers. This opens up an imaginary space for designers and brings new possibilities for design tools. In this study, we proposed a hybrid prototype method that synergistically combines physical models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the conceptual design stage. Correspondingly, we developed a hybrid prototype system to implement the proposed method. We conducted a comparative user study with 45 designers who completed a design task using the physical prototype method, standalone generative AI and the hybrid prototype method, respectively. Our results verified the effectiveness of the hybrid prototype method and investigated its mechanism in supporting creativity. Finally, we discussed the application value and optimisation space of the hybrid prototype method.},

  abstract = {Classifying malware images is important in cybersecurity. The nature of different families and classes of malware images is imbalanced, which leads to a challenging issue of biased classification, where the majority classes dominate the model's performance. Attention is drawn to generative artificial intelligence, in which a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to synthesize more training samples (particularly in minority classes). A more balanced dataset can reduce biased classification towards the majority class. However, a robust GAN model usually requires high computing power and a lot of epochs. In this paper, we aim to design a lightweight GAN model to enhance the performance of malware image classification in imbalanced datasets. Performance evaluation and analysis show that it enhances the model's accuracy and reduces its training time. Future research directions are also shared.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of science and technology, system security is facing an increasing number of threats, among which system vulnerabilities have brought serious challenges to information security. In such an environment, system logs, as key data that record the operating status of computer systems, user operations and various events, play an extremely important role in monitoring system health and quickly locating and resolving system failures. However, the current accuracy of log parsing is not high enough to meet the actual demand; the parsing process is inefficient and difficult to adapt to the processing requirements of large data log files. Aiming at the problems of insufficient accuracy of log parsing and low efficiency of parsing process, a log parsing method AT-parser (Log parser based on word attributes and parse trees) is proposed. Through the log preprocessing, the log content used in the subsequent construction of log templates can be separated, the log content combined with word attribute filtering, retaining the key words, constructing a string set through the key words, and then performing similarity clustering based on the string set to classify the log strings into different log groups. Finally, the final template sequence is generated by constructing a parse tree, which improves the accuracy and speeds up the parsing efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness of AT-Parser is verified by experiments on public datasets.},

  abstract = {The goal of Few Shot Object Detection (FSOD) task is to effectively train and deploy object detection models even in small datasets, in order to achieve high-precision object detection results. Due to the few shot size of the dataset, the model may have difficulty learning sufficiently generalized feature representations, which can lead to overfitting or underfitting issues. Specifically, the model performs well during training, but shows a significant poor performance on test. That's because model overfits the noise and specific samples of the data in the training set, resulting in the inability to generalize to new data. Secondly, in the case of few shots, the target category scale in the dataset is single, making it difficult for the model to distinguish the same target at different scales, which affects detection accuracy. In order to effectively perform FSOD tasks, this paper proposes a meta learning FSOD algorithm based on PRN-FPN. Firstly, a data augmentation module is proposed to address the issue of data scarcity in few shot situations. The module includes three conversion strategies: color, color, and histogram equalization. Combining these three strategies can effectively increase the diversity of scarce data. In order to improve the algorithm's recognition and detection of targets of the same category but different scales, a Predictor head Removing Network with Feature Pyramid Network (PRN FPN) module is proposed. The module adds CARAFE Feature Pyramid Network on the basis of Predictor head Removal Network (RPN), and has the ability to detect few shot objects at multiple scales by fusing features at different depths. Finally, the algorithm was trained and tested on the publicly available dataset Pascal VOC, and the experimental results showed its effectiveness.},

The original data samples are transformed into grey scale graphs, and after combining the samples two by two, they are respectively subjected to feature extraction and comparison, which results in similarity scores, which are finally used to carry out classification. It is shown through experiments that the accuracy of detection can reach up to 98.45\% in the case of few-shot.},

The model demonstrates that the effect of redemptions on asset prices is linear, and the subsequent impact on fund performance is contingent on the initial shock level and asset liquidity diversity. Our findings suggest that funds those holding illiquid stocks face higher liquidity risks, and the liquidity level of underlying common assets between mutual fund portfolios dictates the extent of losses in the liquidated stock prices and the connected fund NAVs. Second, higher liquidity levels of common assets result in lower level of portfolio overlap. These findings highlight the urgency of establishing unified liquidity standard measurements and a cash buffer criterion. To manage fund stability and liquidity effectively, it is essential to implement measures such as minimum cash requirements and optimized asset allocation. These strategies have been proven to offer valuable insights for achieving financial success.},

Experimental results demonstrate a significant enhancement in the accuracy of pavement distress detection when using this enhanced dataset and optimized inference model. Specifically, with the adoption of YOLOv7, the new algorithm increases the detection accuracy of “Crack” by approximately 53.34\% and enhances the detection accuracy of “Corner Breaks” by 50.46\%. When employing YOLOv7x, the detection accuracy for “Crack” improves by around 45.42\%, and the detection accuracy for “Corner Breaks” rises by 46.2\%.},

Through these comparison experiments, we find that both models have impressive performance in image generation. Specifically, Diffusion Models have a more stable training process and perform better in the later stages of training, while GANs have a shorter training time but are relatively less stable due to their adversarial training approach, and have more prominent generation results in the early stages but are slightly weaker than Diffusion Models in the later stages.

  abstract = {As personalized recommendation techniques continue to evolve and be applied, recommendation systems face a plethora of malicious attacks. In order to defend against potential malicious attacks, enhance the robustness of recommendation systems, and strengthen their ability to withstand attacks, it is necessary to propose a method based on Variational Graph Auto-encoders (VGAE) for generating shilling attacks. This method improves the VGAE model, models user profiles, and generates reconstructed user profiles that conform to the original rating patterns. By utilizing spectral clustering, users are selected from the original dataset as templates in a dispersed manner according to a certain attack scale. These templates are then matched with the most similar fake users in the reconstructed user profiles. Within these fake user profiles, ratings for the most popular items in each category and target item ratings are inserted. Finally, fake user profiles are generated and injected into the recommendation system to broadly promote target items to users of the system. Experimental results on the MovieLens 100k and 1M datasets demonstrate that this new method exhibits more stable attack performance and stronger detection evasion capabilities compared to traditional attack strategies, thereby better exposing existing issues within recommendation systems.},

  abstract = {Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has gained significant attention, especially in AI-powered autonomous and adaptive systems (AASs). However, a discernible disconnect exists among research efforts across different communities. The machine learning community often overlooks “explaining to whom,” while the human-computer interaction community has examined various stakeholders with diverse explanation needs without addressing which XAI methods meet these requirements. Currently, no clear guidance exists on which XAI methods suit which specific stakeholders and their distinct needs. This hinders the achievement of the goal of XAI: providing human users with understandable interpretations. To bridge this gap, this article presents a comprehensive XAI roadmap. Based on an extensive literature review, the roadmap summarizes different stakeholders, their explanation needs at different stages of the AI system lifecycle, the questions they may pose, and existing XAI methods. Then, by utilizing stakeholders’ inquiries as a conduit, the roadmap connects their needs to prevailing XAI methods, providing a guideline to assist researchers and practitioners to determine more easily which XAI methodologies can meet the specific needs of stakeholders in AASs. Finally, the roadmap discusses the limitations of existing XAI methods and outlines directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Objectives. This article explores teacher readiness for introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into Sri Lankan schools, drawing on self-efficacy theory. Similar to some other countries, Sri Lanka plans to integrate AI into the school curriculum soon. However, a key question remains: Are teachers prepared to teach this advanced technical subject to schoolchildren? Assessing teacher readiness is crucial, as it is intricately linked to the overall success of this initiative and will inform the development of appropriate policies.Participants. This study surveyed over 1,300 Sri Lankan public school teachers who teach Information and Communication Technology (ICT) using the snowball sampling approach. The respondents represent approximately 20\% of the total ICT teacher population in Sri Lanka. Their readiness to teach AI was assessed using a general teacher self-efficacy scale specifically developed based on the well-established Self-Efficacy Theory. While key demographic factors like gender, education level and educational background were also collected, their impact analysis is not included in this article.Study Method. The study was conducted based on the premise that teachers’ readiness to teach AI hinges on their self-efficacy towards teaching AI in the classroom. This premise was substantiated through a review of existing research, and a conceptual model of teachers’ self-efficacy for AI instruction was developed. To assess this model, a nationwide survey targeting school ICT teachers was conducted. The questionnaire used in the survey was based on existing research on evaluating teacher self-efficacy. Data analysis, focusing on testing and validating the conceptual model, primarily employed the PLS-SEM approach.Findings. This study identified several key findings: (1) Teachers generally reported low self-efficacy regarding their ability to teach AI; (2) Teachers’ self-efficacy was most influenced by their emotional and physiological states, as well as their imaginary experiences related to teaching AI; (3) Surprisingly, mastery experiences had a lesser impact on their self-efficacy for teaching AI; and (4) Neither vicarious experiences (observing others teach AI) nor verbal persuasion had a significant impact on teachers’ self-efficacy. Additionally, the study revealed that the teachers’ own level of expertise in AI, along with their social capital, is insufficient to deliver a standard AI curriculum.Conclusions. The analysis of the results found that Sri Lankan teachers currently lack the readiness to teach AI in schools effectively. Potential lapses in certain sources of self-efficacy were also identified. It further revealed the need for a more systemic approach to teacher professional development. Therefore, the study recommends further research exploring the potential of incorporating a socio-technical systems perspective into the government’s teacher training initiatives.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of 5G and mobile internet, various application fields continue to generate diverse dynamic streaming graphs with large scales and complex structures. Analyzing, querying and mining such a streaming graph face great challenges. To address the challenge of low query efficiency and avoid data loss, this paper proposes a two-stage coarsening method that preserves key features of a streaming graph while improves query efficiency. In the initial stage, the size of the streaming graph is not that large yet. To preserve its structure and attributes as much as possible, a linear mapping method is used for graph coarsening. As the size of the streaming graph increases, a graph neural network model based on cluster pooling is constructed in the second stage. Using a large number of graph coarsening results obtained in the initial stage to train and optimize this model. Then, we use this optimized model to obtain the subsequent summaries, which achieves online efficient graph coarsening. Finally, extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm significantly improves the quality of streaming graph coarsening compared to traditional algorithms. Even compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm Auxo, our algorithm shows a better performance on preserving key features.},

  abstract = {Currently, waste management is one of the most critical issues in Thailand and globally due to the continuous increase in waste volume and improper waste management practices. According to statistics from the Department of Pollution Control, Thailand's waste volume has been increasing annually. As of the latest data in the year 2022, Thailand's total waste volume reached 25.70 million tons per year. This substantial amount of waste can have various adverse effects on the environment, leading to issues such as disease transmission and pollution. To address this problem, there has been ongoing development of technology for waste management and sorting. This presents an intriguing alternative for tackling waste management challenges. If waste can be managed properly and efficiently, it can have positive economic impacts and contribute to environmental development. Recognizing the significance and benefits of waste segregation and proper management, a system for waste detection and sorting based on image recognition and embedded artificial intelligence has been proposed. The system processes images to identify and classify waste, providing notifications regarding the type of waste detected. The model has been trained using deep learning technology, convolutional neural networks, and computer vision-based artificial intelligence. It is operationalized with a prototype robotic platform utilizing highperformance microcontroller boards for processing. The model has been trained with datasets of various types of waste, enabling it to accurately detect and recognize hazardous waste through sensors and robotic platforms. This system has demonstrated superior performance in waste detection and recognition and can operate effectively in diverse real-world environments. Therefore, the waste detection and sorting system based on image recognition and embedded artificial intelligence can help mitigate the risks associated with waste inspection and promote proper and efficient waste management.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence is widely used for various tasks such as language translation and art creation. Generative inference employs the key and value tensors to encode relational information among the tokens in the input and output sequences. Most of the existing generative inference frameworks use KV caching (KVC), which caches the key and value tensors (i.e., the KV cache) to avoid recomputing the key and value tensors for each of the processed tokens. Despite the widespread use of KVC, in-depth characterization of KVC with tensor offloading, which enables generative inference with a single GPU, remains yet to be explored. To bridge this gap, this work presents an in-depth characterization study of KVC, which demonstrates that KVC makes a sub-optimal trade-off between computations and communications in the context of generative inference with tensor offloading. Guided by the characterization results, we propose a novel caching technique called activation sequence caching (ASC) for high-throughput and memory-efficient generative inference with a single GPU. ASC is designed to significantly reduce the memory usage and communication overheads of generative inference at the cost of the increased computational complexity. We provide an analytical analysis of the three caching techniques (i.e., zero caching, KVC, and ASC) for generative inference in terms of the memory usage, communication overheads, and computational complexity. Our quantitative evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of ASC in that ASC significantly (e.g., 78.3\% higher throughput) outperforms a state-of-the-art generative inference framework (i.e., FlexGen) that implements KVC across various model sizes, input and output sequence lengths, and GPUs.},

  abstract = {Open-vocabulary detection (OVD) aims to identify objects from novel, unseen categories that extend beyond the base categories encountered during training. Recent approaches generally resort to large-scale Visual-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to identify novel objects. However, incorporating these models into the OVD problem faces two main challenges: (1) the dgenerated performance when applying a VLM that pre-trained for whole image classification on regional object recognition; (2) the difficulty to localize objects from novel categories. To overcome the above challenges, we propose ACTOR, a DETR-style model which Adapting CLIP for fully Transformer-based Open-vocabulary detection via bidiRectional prompt learning and conditional decoding. Bidirectional prompt learning tightens the alignment between CLIP's regional object features and text embeddings. Conditional decoding facilitates learning a generalizable object localizer through a class-aware matching mechanism. Our experiments on the OV-COCO benchmark demonstrate that ACTOR achieves a competitive detection performance with the end-to-end open-vocabulary detector OV-DETR, while exhibiting a much faster inference speed.},

Some writers have presented worries about these technologies as harbingers of fully automated futures to come, but more pressing is the impact of generative AI on creative labour in the present. Already, business leaders have begun replacing human artistic labour with AI-generated images. In response, the artistic community has launched a protest movement, which argues that AI image generation is a kind of theft. This paper analyzes, substantiates, and critiques these arguments, concluding that AI image generators involve an unethical kind of labour theft. If correct, many other AI applications also rely upon theft.},

These benchmark datasets, however, are often constructed through arbitrary processes that fall short in encapsulating the depth and breadth of the tasks they are intended to measure. In this paper, we interrogate the naturalization of benchmark datasets as veracious metrics by examining the historical development of benchmarking as an epistemic practice in AI research. Specifically, we highlight three key case studies that were crucial in establishing the existing reliance on benchmark datasets for evaluating the capabilities of AI systems: (1) the sharing of Highleyman’s OCR dataset in the 1960s, which solidified a community of knowledge production around a shared benchmark dataset, (2) the Common Task Framework (CTF) of the 1980s, a state-led project to standardize benchmark datasets as legitimate indicators of technical progress; and (3) the Netflix Prize which further solidified benchmarking as a competitive goal within the ML research community. This genealogy highlights how contemporary dynamics and limitations of benchmarking developed from a longer history of collaboration, standardization, and competition. We end with reflections on how this history informs our understanding of benchmarking in the current era of generative artificial intelligence.},

Among them, traditional artificial animation faces problems such as low efficiency and poor quality in image drawing. Therefore, a research proposes a digital animation style generation model based on artificial intelligence. First, the animation style generation model is constructed based on the generative adversarial network. Considering the gradient vanishing problem, the residual network is introduced to perfect the model, and the attention mechanism is introduced to correct the image deviation problem. In the two scenarios of contour feature extraction and comic style transfer, the image loss of the research model is 0.012 and 0.038 respectively, which is better than similar models. In addition, in the comparison of animation style conversion quality, the research model handles the details of animation images better, and its peak signal-to-noise ratio is 23.05db, which is better than similar models. It can be seen that the research technology is superior to similar technologies in the field of animation creation and has good application effects. The research content will provide a technical reference for intelligent animation creation.},

The theoretical framework combines insights from AI’s potential impact on democratic processes, policy cycle research against the backdrop of the digital transformation, and the utilization of AI as a knowledge technology. The research employs qualitative content analysis of parliamentary debates in the 19th and 20th legislative periods, examining patterns of argumentation related to AI.

  abstract = {Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052\% were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.},

  abstract = {In the landscape of rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and growing associated ethical concerns, we propose integrating ethical considerations into daily practices of the AI development teams, to address ethical concerns early, at the time of design and development of AI, which is a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing the AI-GFA (Assess, Implement, Gather Feedback, Act) framework, designed to enable proactive ethical assessments to predict potential risks associated with AI technologies. Through examination of existing ethical frameworks, legislation, principles, and guidelines, this paper aims to bridge the gap between high-level ethical guidelines and their practical application in AI development workflows. The framework emphasises transparency, accountability, and stakeholder involvement, and aligns with consequentialist, deontological, and virtue ethics perspectives. AI-GFA aims to empower development teams to proactively address ethical risks by facilitating informed decision-making and promoting a culture of ethical accountability, transparency, and stakeholder involvement to maximise overall utility by considering a wide range of perspectives and potential consequences.},

However, the impact of implementing GAI in student learning and performance enhancement considerations is still lacking. Therefore, this study proposes an experimental framework for evaluating the effectiveness of GAI-based learning for students. By scrutinizing instructional goals and design strategies to achieve desirable learning outcomes, it provides guidelines on coverage design and development in GAI-based learning environments. Experiment with case studies on supply chain and cold chain management is adopted to analyze the effectiveness and facilitate instructional design in GAI-based learning to enhance the student learning experience. The result indicates that the treatment group outperformed the control group. This study is expected to provide insights into academic development and future education on GAI-based learning.},

However, the opacity of these black-box models presents significant challenges. In this study, we propose a LightGBM-based automatic classification model for epilepsy trained using TUH EEG data. Ten channels were employed, and 22 features from both the time and frequency domains were estimated from each channel. The model can distinguish between normal EEG, focal epilepsy, and generalised epilepsy. We trained the model on a dataset comprising 600 adult EEG records. Five-fold cross-validation yielded a mean accuracy of 89.46\% and a mean F1 score of 0.8907 on the training set. To assess the model’s generalization performance, we independently tested it on 456 EEGs, achieving an accuracy of 71.49\% and a weighted F1-score of 0.7386. Furthermore, we employed permutation feature importance, SHAP and LIME, to provide explanations for the model’s decisions. This model has the potential to gain the trust of clinicians and facilitate its adoption in clinical settings.},

Because of this complexity, governing technology and data to support artificial intelligence (AI) capability has proven to be a difficult task that—according to experts—requires a systems perspective in its design and implementation. In this article, we take a conceptual approach to respond to this call from experts by providing working definitions of both enterprise data governance and a systems approach to management. Using these working definitions and data from municipal governments in Mexico, we develop a system dynamics model to explore some potential tradeoffs in the process of developing an enterprise view of information systems and data to create capability to develop AI applications in government. Simulation experiments suggest that an emphasis on governance of IT may create a strong foundation for the development of AI capability.},

In this paper, we present a systematic approach for studying how to support learning to co-create with GenAI systems, informed by methods and concepts from the learning sciences. Through an experimental case study, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to study and compare the impacts of different types of learning supports in the context of text-to-image GenAI models.

  abstract = {The development of big data provides abundant resources for enterprises to target users and adjust development strategies. However, it also brings about an escalating risk of personal information leakage. In this context, the methods and standards for determining the acts of infringement have yet to be clarified, leading to different judgements in the same case. Grounded on the existing modes of legislation and judicial adjudication, the paper proposes machine learning methods to deconstruct the determination of acts of infringement, with a goal of assisting judges in making more accurate judgments. Specifically, the paper employs Adaboost regression model and the logistic regression model with gradient descent. Adaboost regression model combines multiple weak classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification, while the logistic regression model with gradient descent adjusts model values by minimizing the loss function to pursue the optimal ones. Through training and evaluation, the paper reveals that these models possess favorable applicability in determining the acts of infringement. Moreover, the paper also mentions the predictive results and evaluation metrics of the models, as well as their validation and application under various determination methods.Through the application of mathematical models and machine learning algorithms, the paper deconstructs the methods of infringement determination in personal information protection disputes. The evaluation and analysis of the models' applicability provides a guarantee for its adaption to different methods of determination, ensuring a reliable algorithmic model for the judicial review of personal information protection disputes when applying machine learning.},

  abstract = {The surge to popularity of Artificial Intelligence has greatly impacted on how the financial industry conducts their services. With several financial technology (FinTech) companies seizing the opportunity to be the first big fish in the market, a review on the impact of Artificial Intelligence in the FinTech industry around the world is necessary. While Artificial Intelligence provides significant benefits to FinTech companies, there are also risks and challenges that come with using AI. The availability of large datasets has paved the way for FinTech companies to utilize this opportunity to improve and transform their services. As the world moves on towards a cash-less future, people have been more inclined to use e-wallets and credit cards to perform their daily transactions. While this significantly improves the everyday financial experience of consumers, the lack of rigid authentication and verification usually leads to financial fraud that may eventually lead to billion-dollar loss from the consumer. Thus, this paper reviewed several articles on which different impacts of FinTech are discussed. Additionally, risks and challenges of usage of AI are also discussed. This paper shall serve as future reference for developing countries such as the Philippines in order to maximize their growth in the FinTech industry.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on exploring the key factors influencing the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) by university teachers in the context of digital education, particularly in the backdrop of human-computer interaction. Considering the challenges posed by small-sample data, we employed various machine learning models such as linear regression, random forest regression, and support vector regression (SVR), and optimized model parameters through grid search and cross-validation techniques. The optimized models exhibited significantly improved performance, with the linear regression model showing a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.1239 and an R² score of 0.6362, indicating its good predictive accuracy and generalization ability on the small-sample dataset. The study results emphasize performance expectations, perceived value, and community influence as primary influencing factors for university teachers' use of generative AI, especially in the context of human-computer interaction. This is crucial for understanding and promoting the acceptance and use of educational technology. This research provides valuable insights for education policymakers and technology developers and offers important methodological guidance for machine learning applications dealing with small-sample data.},

Descriptive and lag sequential analysis methods were employed to examine the characteristics and patterns of students' information behavior according to Ellis' model of information seeking. The results indicated that although students frequently used generative AI tools as primary information sources, they also sought additional resources to satisfy their informational needs. Additionally, students sometimes copied and pasted useful information from generative AI tools into group documents to share with their group members. Lag sequential analysis revealed that students typically began their information seeking process with generative AI tools, followed by exploring additional information sources.},

In order to achieve the style transfer between Chinese ink paintings and Van Gogh's artworks, this paper introduces a self-made new dataset and implements the transformation between these two artistic styles based on the CycleGAN network model. Furthermore, through methods such as data augmentation and learning rate adjustment, this study extensively explores the key factors affecting the learning process of the adversarial loss function in CycleGAN. The results reveal that augmenting the self-made dataset through data enhancement techniques, such as adding noise and color transformations, can enhance the robustness of the model. Additionally, employing the "learning rate warm-up" strategy effectively updates parameters during training, leading to better fitting to the optimal solution.},

  abstract = {Trustworthy artificial intelligence (Trusted AI) is of utmost importance when learning-enabled components (LECs) are used in autonomous, safety-critical systems. When reliant on deep learning, these systems need to address the reliability, robustness, and interpretability of learning models. In addition to developing strategies to address these concerns, appropriate software architectures are needed to coordinate LECs and ensure they deliver acceptable behavior even under uncertain conditions. This work describes Anunnaki, a model-driven framework comprising loosely-coupled modular services designed to monitor and manage LECs with respect to Trusted AI assurance concerns when faced with different sources of uncertainty. More specifically, the Anunnaki framework supports the composition of independent, modular services to assess and improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems. The design of Annunaki was guided by several key software engineering principles (e.g., modularity, composability, and reusability) in order to facilitate its use and maintenance to support different aggregate monitoring and assurance analysis tools for LESs and their respective data sets. We demonstrate Anunnaki on two autonomous platforms, a terrestrial rover, and an unmanned aerial vehicle. Our studies show how Anunnaki can be used to manage the operations of different autonomous learning-enabled systems with vision-based LECs while exposed to uncertain environmental conditions.},

Through empirical research, the performance of AI models is compared with traditional statistical methods. Results show that LSTM-based AI models outperform traditional methods in prediction accuracy, stability, and anomaly handling. The study also discusses challenges faced by AI applications, such as data security, ethical regulation, and talent cultivation, and proposes countermeasures.

Finding trapped people in a timely and accurate manner is crucial to reducing casualties and improving rescue efficiency. Traditional blind search algorithms are often inefficient due to the lack of effective guidance strategies. Heuristic search algorithms improve search efficiency by combining heuristic functions, but they still have limitations in complex environments. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved Q-learning algorithm based on reinforcement learning that combines dynamic exploration rate, experience replay, and target network for searching for people after an earthquake. The algorithm reduces the randomness in the exploration process by dynamically adjusting the exploration rate, uses experience replay to improve learning efficiency, and introduces a target network to stabilize the training process. Experimental results show that the improved reinforcement learning Q-learning algorithm is significantly superior to traditional blind search and heuristic search algorithms in terms of search efficiency and accuracy.},

  abstract = {The rise of AI stems from the combined progress of big data, algorithms, and computing power. At present, the rapid development of global rail transit, whether subway, light rail or high-speed rail, are experiencing unprecedented growth rate development. This is due to the acceleration of urbanization on the one hand, but also due to technological progress on the other hand. Rail transit systems are deeply integrated with the latest communication, sensor and artificial intelligence technologies to achieve intelligent operations. Failures caused by aging and improper maintenance of equipment occur from time to time, affecting operational efficiency and even passenger safety. As the rail transit system is usually very complex, it is difficult to achieve accurate prediction and preventive maintenance, in this context, the condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of rail transit vehicle equipment becomes particularly important. In this paper, artificial intelligence is introduced into the equipment monitoring and maintenance system of rail transit, which is conducive to optimizing the system capacity and improving the data processing efficiency. In this paper, experimental method and comparison method are used to analyze the fault detection in the condition monitoring and maintenance of vehicle equipment, and the performance of different fault types, active semi-supervised learning and random sampling methods are compared and described. The experimental results show that random sampling is 0.01 higher than active semi-supervised learning only when the amount of data annotation is 2000.},

In particular, the extensive application of information technology such as artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing has penetrated into all walks of life. In the process of intelligent building construction, computer network system plays a crucial role. Artificial intelligence can analyze the risk trends and patterns of wind power project pile foundation engineering by processing a large amount of historical risk data, and predict possible future risks. This helps the project team to develop corresponding risk management strategies and preventive measures. The risk assessment and management of pile foundation project of wind power project is of great significance to enhance the competitiveness of construction enterprises. Based on the analysis and research of relevant literatures at home and abroad and combined with artificial intelligence algorithm, this paper designs a risk assessment system for offshore wind power projects, so as to effectively reduce the risk incidence of pile foundation projects of wind power projects and improve the economic benefits of enterprises. Then, the accuracy performance of the system is tested. The test results show that as the fuzzy output value continues to rise from 0.2 to 1, the accuracy score also shows an increasing trend, indicating that the accuracy of the risk prediction system has improved. Based on this data, the performance of the risk prediction system can be evaluated and the prediction algorithm or model can be further improved, thus increasing the level of accuracy.},

  abstract = {In the field of bioinformatics, the algorithm of biological gene sequence has always been one of the hot problems in scientific research. With the combination of biology and artificial intelligence technology, genetic algorithm data is increasing. At the same time, the emergence of a new generation of sequencing technology, the decrease in sequencing time and cost, and the high sequencing throughput have significantly increased the sequence data, showing an exponential growth trend, and there are still new biological gene sequence data found and recorded every day, and the speed of data generation is much faster than the speed of data processing, so the processing of large-scale DNA sequencing data needs more efficient methods. Therefore, AI bioinformatics engineering, especially genetic algorithms and K-means cluster analysis, has become an important tool in the field of bioinformatics statistics, with particular impact on the detection and diagnosis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) associated with contact dermatitis. These advanced AI models efficiently process large amounts of genomic data, including SNP datasets, and have the ability to analyze patient genotype information. By doing so, they can identify SNPS that are strongly associated with contact dermatitis and establish meaningful associations between these genetic variants and the disease.The adoption of this personalized medicine approach not only addresses the specific needs of individual patients but also significantly enhances the success rate of treatment. Through the analysis of convolution algorithm and gene sequence in biological information engineering, this paper focuses on the relevant experiments of gene K-cluster analysis model, demonstrating the advantages and reference significance of gene algorithm under K-cluster analysis for current gene information statistics.},

  abstract = {In post-disaster scenarios, government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) work to coordinate disaster relief efforts efficiently, aiming to meet humanitarian needs promptly. Utilizing available data such as satellite imagery, sensor data, and social media, alongside data mining and big data analytics, can significantly enhance disaster management efforts. However, timely access to these often fragmented and incomplete data presents challenges. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, offer solutions by enabling faster response times for government agencies, NGOs, and other authorities. This research examines 72 studies on the application of AI in various stages of disaster management, including the simulation, detection, prediction, and handling of post-disaster situations. AI-based systems improve the issuance of early warnings, streamline risk communication, optimize relief logistics, and support evacuation plans while also aiding in the decision-making processes for the issuance of building permits and grants. The analysis highlights the transformative potential of AI across all disaster management phases, from preparedness and response to prevention/mitigation and recovery, and identifies future challenges in this domain. In conclusion, the study underscores the power of AI not only in forecasting the occurrence and impact zones of disasters but also in identifying the most vulnerable communities and assessing the viability of disaster response strategies.},

  abstract = {While Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has made significant strides in various sectors, there’s a discernible gap in literature regarding its specific applications and implications within the Financial Technology (FinTech) landscape. This paper endeavors to address this void, evaluating the potential of FinTech to harness GenAI’s capabilities and the existing discussions on GenAI’s impact in the domain. Through a comprehensive analysis of its integration by leading financial institutions such as Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and Capital One, the study offers insights into GenAI’s transformative potential in FinTech. We discuss the main problems these companies are solving, from identification and mitigation of fraudulent activities and ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks to improving customer service and operations and making better data-driven decisions. By addressing both the opportunities and challenges, this paper aims to provide a holistic perspective on the role of GenAI in the evolving FinTech sector.},

  abstract = {Machine game is divided into complete information game and incomplete information game. Similarly, according to the transparency of opponent information, military chess game can be divided into complete information chess game and incomplete information chess game. In this paper, we mainly study the complete information chess game. Aiming at the high time complexity and high computing power of traditional tree search algorithms, a Deep Monte-Carlo (DMC) algorithm based on segmentation strategy of reward is proposed to solve the problem of high mortality of high-level chess pieces and improve the winning rate of the whole game system. By competing with military chess systems constructed by Upper Confidence Tree (UCT) algorithm and Deep Q-learning (DQN) algorithm, we constructed a complete verification scheme to obtain the best segmentation strategy of reward and verify the effectiveness of DMC algorithm based on segmentation strategy of reward.},

  abstract = {Personality analysis has a positive influence on humanity as it aids in identifying personality traits and disorders. In addition, it facilitates the monitoring of cases and enriches doctors’ knowledge bases, particularly in decision-making processes. This study includes a comprehensive literature review on personality analysis approaches from social media, aiming to gain a thorough understanding of the current studies on personality therapy. Moreover, the objective of this study is to identify various limitations present in these studies and explore potential avenues for enhancement. More specifically, this research begins with an introduction that discusses the main concepts of traits and personality disorders, as well as the importance of psychological analysis. Following that, four cluster studies related to personality analysis on social media are presented: personality traits, personality disorders, detection of links between diseases, and monitoring patient status. Then, the majority of the currently available works for each cluster are exposed. Afterward, a comparative study of the different presented works is proposed. Finally, an outline of plans for further research in this area is provided, detailing potential paths for exploration.},

  abstract = {Problem: The problem of the finalized exploration revolved around the inadequacy of current traffic forecasting models. Despite decades of examination in many fields, existing approaches, often relying on linear models and stationary time series assumptions, struggle to accurately predict traffic under chaotic events. The identified limitation has profound consequences, evident in the significant economic losses and time inefficiencies incurred due to traffic congestion, as exemplified by the $144 billion in losses and the 34\% increase in travel time for drivers in Los Angeles County in 2013. The challenge lies in the inherently unpredictable nature of traffic events, ranging from regular rush hours causing sharp declines in traffic speed to unpredictable accidents leading to unforeseen delays. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a more effective and adaptive traffic forecasting model that can reliably operate under both normal and abnormal traffic conditions, addressing the shortcomings of traditional linear models and stationary time series assumptions. Purpose: The purpose of the completed investigation was to determine whether a traffic forecasting model that incorporates machine learning and deep learning technologies can yield effective traffic forecasts based on real-time weather and traffic data. Method: The study involved the development of a traffic forecasting model as informed by existing literature. Data collection was done through simulating data similar to the traffic data from Los Angeles County that was utilized in Yu et al.’s research on deep learning and traffic prediction in extreme weather scenarios [1]. Data analysis was done through MAE and t-test. Results: The findings demonstrated that the created traffic forecasting model outperformed the current methods in its ability to provide traffic forecasts with a better degree of accuracy. Conclusion: Regardless of the traffic volume, weather, or time of day, the developed traffic forecasting algorithm can give precise real-time traffic predictions.},

The initial application of artificial intelligence (AI) was in the field of medical imaging for the automatic detection of lung nodules in X-ray and computed tomography (CT) techniques. Malignant pulmonary nodules are often associated with primary lung tumors and metastatic lung lesions, so the screening, diagnosis and differentiation of pulmonary nodules are very important for the subsequent treatment of lung diseases.},

The first field of AI for Science is the prediction and design of protein structure, and simulating the structure of certain natural proteins has become a popular topic in biopharmaceutical research. The generative adversarial network model in deep learning and a target sequence method were used in the paper to mimic the special structure of natural proteins. We successfully synthesized the ProteinA-like peptide sequence which had a high structural similarity with the natural proteins in its tertiary structure.These synthetic peptide sequences by computer will lay the foundation for the later transcription to become mRNA and to synthesize protein in the laboratory .},

  abstract = {Indeed, the development of future autonomous and intelligent transportation systems depends heavily on vehicular networks. They allow vehicles to connect with one another, with roadside infrastructure, and with centralized control systems. RSUs can store regularly accessed data including map updates, traffic data, and software updates. Data caching is one of the main responsibilities of Road side Units (RSUs) in Vehicular application as sending the same content repeatedly wastes a lot of system resources. Utilizing caching resources effectively can lower the link load imposed by content transmission, thus enhancing the quality of experience (QoE) for users. However, inefficient collaboration among network routers may lead to substantial energy wastage. To address the aforementioned problem and reduce the requested content energy consumption, this paper proposes artificial intelligence empowered collaborative content caching scheme utilizing the concept of both on path caching and off path caching. Performance analyses show that the proposed technique outperforms other current caching strategies.},

  abstract = {To reduce the injury and fatality of the special group of pedestrians in the rapid traffic flow, engineers can utilize artificial intelligence to detect human bodies and postures. The design enables identification of the existence of pedestrians in the intersection and identifies their postures with NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network (CuDNN). This mechanism helps the authority to devise an advanced algorithm to manipulate the traffic lights to allow these accommodation-needed people to cross the road in time when they are in the intersections. By experiments, Zaixin has found that the trend of altering a single parameter cannot be summarized without taking the influence of other parameters and the complexity of data sets into account. Enlarging the size of the image can increase the accuracy but can also decrease that in different scenarios. RGB models usually deliver more desirable results with higher maximum Average Precision (mAP) of human detection and the accuracy of the gesture recognition than the thermal model trained by our team. Trained models are more precise and accurate than the pre-trained models generated with HRNet. Implementations based on the new techniques can substantially enhance the safety of senior and disabled pedestrians.},

It is born to solve the problems faced by the previous generation of the Internet such as imbalanced distribution of interests, monopoly of platform resources, and leakage of personal privacy. In this survey, we discuss the latest development status of Web 3.0 and the application of emerging AI technologies in it. First, we investigate the current successful practices of Web 3.0 and various components in the current Web 3.0 ecosystem and thus propose the hierarchical architecture of the Web 3.0 ecosystem from the perspective of application scenarios. The architecture we proposed contains four layers: data management, value circulation, ecological governance, and application scenarios. We dive into the current state of development and the main challenges and issues present in each layer. In this context, we find that AI technology will have great potential. We first briefly introduce the role that artificial intelligence technology may play in the development of Web 3.0. Then, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the current application status of artificial intelligence technology in the four layers of Web 3.0 and provide some insights into its potential future development directions.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the ethical implications of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings, from primary schools to universities, while drawing insights from ancient Greek philosophy to address emerging concerns. As AI technologies increasingly influence learning environments, they offer novel opportunities for personalized learning, efficient assessment, and data-driven decision-making. However, these advancements also raise critical ethical questions regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, student autonomy, and the changing roles of educators. This research examines specific use cases of AI in education, analyzing both their potential benefits and drawbacks. By revisiting the philosophical principles of ancient Greek thinkers such as Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato, we discuss how their writings can guide the ethical implementation of AI in modern education. The paper argues that while AI presents significant challenges, a balanced approach informed by classical philosophical thought can lead to an ethically sound transformation of education. It emphasizes the evolving role of teachers as facilitators and the importance of fostering student initiative in AI-rich environments.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has made significant contributions in various aspects and domains of human life, permeating fields such as Education, Healthcare, Economy, Socialization, Security, Agriculture, and Privacy. This research specifically delves into the promising possibilities and applications of AI in healthcare and medical domains, focusing on developing a Medical Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. The proposed approach involves using different pre-trained NER models and an in-house-generated corpora to train a personalized Spacy model. The research then conducts a thorough comparison of these models to understand their strengths and shortcomings. Widening the scope of the proposed research, we introduce an inventive mechanism to extract medical information from doctors' audio in real-time saved on buffer memory, deleted after use, which is then used to create patient medical prescriptions. The potential benefits of this mechanism are vast, expanding beyond reducing patient wait times, enhancing the clarity of prescriptions, maintains comprehensive patient histories, and finally introducing automation into the prescription drug ordering chain. Additionally, the proposed model eases the scheduling and management of medical tests and procedures based on doctor and patient availability. In jist, the proposed paper aims to present an innovative human-centric approach to automating interactions between patients and doctors and optimizing the delivery of healthcare services. Through the integration of modern-day AI services, The proposed mechanism has the potential to bring about a potential change in medical practices, providing a more efficient and effective breakthrough to patient care.},

  abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot, is transforming educational methodologies, including undergraduate physics courses for engineering students. Despite their potential, these LLMs typically rely on statistical learning methods and often exhibit algebraic inaccuracies in solving standard university-level physics problems. This study explores the use of LLMs in physics courses for N = 91 freshman engineering students over two academic terms (Spring and Fall 2023). Students engaged in AI-assisted activities to solve physics problems and were asked to identify and correct the errors made by the chatbot. The outcomes were compared with those from traditional teaching methods without AI involvement, and no significant difference in student learning gains was found. To assess the impact of AI tools in education, a more detailed approach using pre-test and post-test instruments&nbsp;with control and experimental groups is necessary. Survey results revealed, however, that AI-assisted sessions enhanced student engagement, problem-solving skills, and understanding of physics concepts. Students also indicated a strong preference for AI-assisted activities, citing increased motivation and a firm belief in the educational benefits of using these tools. Our findings suggest that well-designed AI interventions can effectively complement traditional instructional methods, especially when the LLMs are integrated with symbolic computational tools like WolframAlpha to improve their accuracy.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a new framework for studying the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the organization of knowledge work. We incorporate AI into an economy where humans endogenously form hierarchical firms: Less knowledgeable agents become "workers" solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable agents become "solvers" handling exceptions. We model AI as an algorithm that uses compute to mimic humans. We compare the equilibrium before and after AI's introduction, distinguishing between "basic" AI (with knowledge equivalent to pre-AI workers) and "advanced" AI (with knowledge equivalent to pre-AI solvers). We show that basic AI increases the knowledge content of human work, leading to smaller, less productive, and less decentralized firms. In contrast, advanced AI decreases the knowledge content of human work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized firms. In any case, the most knowledgeable humans benefit from AI, while the least knowledgeable benefit only when AI is sufficiently advanced. We discuss how these effects depend on AI's autonomy and the availability of compute. https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05481},

Using this meta-model, a device composed of connected objects enabled us to identify each action and associate them with a signature in the sensor signals. The benefits are numerous: contributing to the development of regular and frequent profiles, assisting practitioners in considering the temporal variation of sensory profiles in their decision-making, and objectifying the measurements.},

Caregiving activities require dynamic, often unpredictable, and sometimes emotionally draining tasks that deal with a large amount of information. We conducted a systematic review to understand what AI technology has been developed to support informal caregivers of PLWD. We collected 920 papers from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed. Screening and eligibility evaluation resulted in 16 papers for full-text review.

  abstract = {Biological information processing plays a pivotal role in modern life, with applications ranging from health monitoring to personalized medicine. This study endeavors to delve into a method employing artificial neural networks for the analysis of biological signals, specifically focusing on assessing individual attention levels. By harnessing physiological data such as heart rate variability and skin conductance, coupled with the utilization of artificial neural networks for data analysis and modeling, a more comprehensive understanding of individual attention states can be attained. In the experimental phase, a diverse pool of individuals was tested, and the experimental results were validated using recorded videos. The findings underscore the efficacy of the artificial neural network-based method in assessing individual attention levels, achieving an accuracy rate of 76.9\%. This research not only introduces novel methodologies but also opens avenues for leveraging artificial intelligence technology in biological signal analysis and attention assessment. Future research endeavors could delve deeper into exploring additional features of biological signals and enhancing model performance to bolster assessment accuracy and practical applicability.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has brought many conveniences to people, and at the same time has had a huge impact on the traditional education model. Interactive learning platforms have become mainstream in the context of the big data era. This article takes an online course in a university as an example to explore user interest points, demand characteristics and knowledge acquisition rules in an artificial intelligence system environment. After processing and analyzing students' browsing behavior in different scenarios, the corresponding results are returned to the database to better grasp the user's preference information and provide more services for teaching. At the same time, through the application of machine intelligence algorithms and AI technology, the personalized recommendation capabilities of the learning platform can be improved to meet students' personalized learning needs. This article tests the algorithm of the system. The test results show that the content-based recommendation algorithm performs medium to high in accuracy, but its coverage is low and is not affected by data sparsity. The collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm performs generally highest in terms of accuracy and coverage, with an accuracy rate of 96\%, and is sensitive to sparse data. The hybrid recommendation algorithm has high accuracy and coverage, and factors such as data sparsity have a medium to high impact on it. Recommendation algorithms based on deep learning show high levels of accuracy and coverage, and their impact on factors such as data sparsity is also moderate to high. However, although artificial intelligence technology has broad prospects for application in the field of education, it also faces some challenges, such as privacy protection and compliance with data use. Therefore, in the process of promoting and applying artificial intelligence technology, it is necessary to strengthen compliance with relevant laws and regulations to ensure that students' information security and privacy rights are effectively protected.},

The paper emphasizes the need to reorient the test and activity design process that certifies students in their knowledge. This involves tapping into the structural characteristics of human beings where machines lack inherent qualities.

  abstract = {Pixel-level fine-grained image editing remains an open challenge. Previous works fail to achieve an ideal trade-off between control granularity and inference speed. They either fail to achieve pixel-level fine-grained control, or their inference speed requires optimization. To address this, this paper for the first time employs a regression-based network to learn the variation patterns of StyleGAN latent codes during the image dragging process. This method enables pixel-level precision in dragging editing with little time cost. Users can specify handle points and their corresponding target points on any GAN-generated images, and our method will move each handle point to its corresponding target point. Through experimental analysis, we discover that a short movement distance from handle points to target points yields a high-fidelity edited image, as the model only needs to predict the movement of a small portion of pixels. To achieve this, we decompose the entire movement process into multiple sub-processes. Specifically, we develop a transformer encoder-decoder based network named 'Latent Predictor' to predict the latent code motion trajectories from handle points to target points in an autoregressive manner. Moreover, to enhance the prediction stability, we introduce a component named 'Latent Regularizer', aimed at constraining the latent code motion within the distribution of natural images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference speed and image editing performance at the pixel-level granularity.},

To solve the problem of low efficiency, research has introduced fuzzy PID and AI technology in this field, established models and algorithms, automated reversing and edge detection. Research on subtracting its length through the difference algorithm of the filtering program, and under the drive of the sensor, search for the edge of the wire near the side plate of the take-up reel.

  abstract = {Design by Contract represents an established, lightweight paradigm for engineering reliable and robust software systems by specifying verifiable expectations and obligations between software components. Due to its laborious nature, developers hardly adopt Design by Contract in practice.    A plethora of research on (semi-)-automated inference to reduce the manual burden has not improved the adoption of so-called code contracts in practice.    This paper examines the potential of Generative AI to automatically generate code contracts in terms of pre- and postconditions for any Java project without requiring any additional auxiliary artifact.    To fine-tune two state-of-the-art Large Language Models, CodeT5 and CodeT5+, we derive a dataset of more than 14k Java methods comprising contracts in form of Java Modeling Language (JML) annotations, and train the models on the task of generating contracts.    We examine the syntactic and semantic validity of the contracts generated for software projects not used in the fine-tuning and find that more than 95\% of the generated contracts are syntactically correct and exhibit remarkably high completeness and semantic correctness.    To this end, our fully automated method sets the stage for future research and eventual broader adoption of Design by Contract in software development practice.},

  abstract = {Mathematical stories have demonstrated the ability to bolster the motivation and interest of students in learning mathematics, thereby exerting a positive influence on their academic performance. However, due to a lack of adequate resources and the desire to engage students in the creation process, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is utilized to generate mathematical stories accompanied by images. This study presents a framework for automatic quality assessment to evaluate the coherence of multimodal text and images generated by GAI, as well as the appropriateness of the stories for different grade levels. The dataset comprises mathematical stories generated by GAI for grades 3, 4, and 5, obtained from an American online learning platform, each story consisting of titles, bodies, and image illustrations generated by GP4, images generated by DALL-E3. Initially, a method is devised based on CLIP model and Mini-GPT4 for extracting multimodal semantic features to establish the relationship between text and images in mathematical stories and their generation parameters. Subsequently, mathematical text features are designed, including nine mathematical text attributes and ten traditional text readability indicators, followed by collinearity feature selection and statistical testing. Finally, five machine learning grade regressor for mathematical stories were trained, and the correlation between these 19 features and grades is explored using genetic algorithm-based factor mining and the interpretable artificial intelligence method SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To further understand advanced text features, the latest natural language processing (NLP) readability indicators are also integrated into the analysis. Through multimodal features, traditional text readability metrics, and NLP readability indicators, this method introduces a novel approach for automatically assessing the quality of GAI-generated multimodal mathematical stories, providing a tool for grade predictor and shedding light on the factors (Image-text relevance and textual features) influencing the grade level of analyzed stories, thereby offering new insights for leveraging GAI in mathematical education.},

  abstract = {Task-oriented chatbots are increasingly used to access all sorts of services – like booking a flight, or setting a medical appointment – through natural language conversation. There are many technologies for implementing task-oriented chatbots, including Dialogflow, Watson, and Rasa. They rely on an explicit definition of the user intents, conversation flows, and chatbot outputs, which is costly to specify, and sometimes results in suboptimal user experiences and artificial conversations with limited diversity of chatbot responses. Recently, the advances in generative artificial intelligence fostered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new range of open-domain chatbots, like ChatGPT, able to converse fluently on any topic. However, they are general-purpose, and therefore not directly usable to solve specialised tasks reliably. In this paper, we study the power of LLMs to build task-oriented chatbots, resulting in lighter specifications – no intent definition required – and more natural conversations than in intent-based approaches. To this end, we propose a lightweight domain-specific language based on YAML to specify chatbots using modules of different types (e.g., menus, question-answering, data gathering). These specifications are compiled into structured LLM prompts that use the ReAct framework to inform our runtime how to interpret the user input and coordinate the tasks that the chatbot must perform. The paper presents the design and realisation of our framework, and an assessment that encodes a set of existing intent-based chatbots using our approach, showing its benefits in terms of specification size, conversation flexibility and output diversity.},

  abstract = {Medical institutions are looking forward to importing innovative information services to reduce the burden on medical staff. For example, medical staff repeatedly process the contextual data in each stage of the prenatal examinations, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. If a dispute happens, the data will become the evidence to support whether the prenatal examinations were handled appropriately. Therefore, if the prenatal examination data is not accurately recorded and properly preserved, it will become a source of pressure for medical staff to face disputes in the future. This research takes the prenatal examinations of pregnant as a use case. We apply robotic process automation technology to assist in the automation of prenatal examinations and blockchain technology to establish trustworthy prenatal examinations. Besides, we also use generative artificial intelligence technology to provide intelligent user-assisted consultation in open-domain question answering. The contribution of this work is to build an automated reliable prenatal examination information service to provide good care for pregnant.},

  abstract = {In recent years, many fields have expanded their research methods through the integration of artificial intelligence. In the current medical field, it is widely used in image recognition to diagnose patient symptoms, train clinical prediction models, and improve clinical workflow processes to avoid missing treatment opportunities. These methods have all achieved good results so far. Now, generative AI is also impacting the development of the medical field, not only generating prescriptions that match patient conditions but also being applied in generating medical images for data augmentation and simulating various pathological conditions, thereby aiding in training deep learning models. Stroke is a leading cause of death or disability, ranking as the second leading cause of death worldwide, next to cancer. If cancers were categorized individually, stroke would surpass all single diseases, making it a primary focus of research in brain disease treatment. There are already studies where generative AI has been used to create medical images, which are then manually evaluated by doctors to determine if they were generated by AI. In this project, we plan to generate CT images of strokes using generative AI and use a trained model (to diagnose stroke) to improve accuracy. Through this project, we hope to solve the problem of scarce stroke CT images while also providing support for training stroke-related models.},

  abstract = {The accurate decoding and intention recognition of motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) are of great significance for the implementation of brain computer interface (BCI). However, the time non-stationary properties of MI-EEG signals and the uneven information distribution of different electrode channels pose challenges to the classification of MI-EEG. To address these challenges, we proposed a convolutional network based on channel and temporal attention (CTACNet). First, raw MI-EEG signals underwent noise reduction by common average reference. Subsequently, channel attention module was used to enhance the electrode channel information related to classification. Then, shallow spatiotemporal features of MI-EEG were extracted through convolutional neural network, and time series representations containing spatial information were output. Importantly, time attention module automatically adjusted and learned the impact of different time series on classification. Finally, deep spatiotemporal features were further extracted through time convolutional network, and fully connected layers were used to complete the classification of MI-EEG. Validation experiments based on the BCI competition IV-2a dataset showed that the proposed CTACNet achieved an average classification accuracy of 84.22\% for each subject. Compared with MBEEGSE, ETCNet, EEG-TCNet, and CNN-LSTM, there were significant improvements of 2.20\%, 9.42\%, 4.50\%, and 5.40\%, respectively. This demonstrates the potential of CTACNet in significantly enhancing MI-EEG decoding and intent recognition.},

  abstract = {This research delves into integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI within Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to bolster fraud prevention measures. The study commences by thoroughly mapping the fraud tree taxonomy with existing ERP applications to identify areas susceptible to fraudulent activities, encompassing corruption, asset misappropriation, and financial statement fraud. The research proposes the utilisation of specific NLP and Generative AI APIs tailored to address these areas, effectively building upon these identified vulnerabilities. By establishing standardised criteria for API development, the research provides a comprehensive roadmap for the accounting and finance profession to adopt and implement these advanced technologies to combat fraud more efficiently. The suggested roadmap encompasses crucial stages, including evaluating organisational requirements, assessing API providers, seamlessly integrating APIs into ERP systems, conducting thorough testing, and establishing robust monitoring and governance mechanisms. The findings underscore the tremendous potential of NLP and Generative AI in fortifying fraud prevention endeavours within ERP systems while highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of this research, which amalgamates insights from ERP systems, fraud detection, NLP, and Generative AI. The study also encourages future empirical investigations to validate and refine the proposed solutions within real-world contexts.},

The AV-LGI Module is composed of three stages: Local Intra-Region Interaction, Global Inter-Region Interaction, and Local-Global Interaction, which can better capture detailed information at local-level and efficiently learn the fine-grained correlations of inter-modalities in video deepfake detection under lower computational overheads. We further propose an adaptive modality selection strategy to facilitate model learning. Besides, a variety of data augmentation techniques are incorporated for audio-visual branches to enhance the robustness of the AV-LGNN. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of our model.},

  abstract = {The introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022 kickstarted the release of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) applications to the public domain. Such chat interfaces are based on large language models (LLMs) and possess a vast array of abilities spanning conversation, the writing and debugging of code, the writing of papers, and the creation of images, music, and songs. With students now having access to a myriad of GAI tools, academia has been permanently altered.Our proposed system, named Code Analysis and Education Tutor (CAET), integrates GAI into early Computer Science education by providing students with an ethical alternative to existing GAI tools. CAET is designed to assist students with programming tasks in a manner tailored to their individual needs without jeopardizing the integrity of their learning. A point of uniqueness from existing works is CAET's ability to display or hide generated code based on its pertinence to the problem at hand. After subjecting multiple GAI models to common programming errors and queries, we settled on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model due to its comprehensive capabilities and cost-effectiveness. Overall, CAET underscored the model's conversational dynamics and provided insights for creating a more personalized learning experience for students in an introductory computer science course.},

  abstract = {Rather than using AI to make art that imitates the work of human artists, we aim to design machines to support human artists in their creative work. However, assisting in creative tasks without getting in the way of the artist’s workflow can be challenging. Since there is no "correct" answer in creative works for the machine to steer towards, the machine must gauge the "goodness" or "badness" of its actions by watching the user’s response. We present our system, ‘Hero’, for eliciting and developing interactions around creative machines, particularly drawing machines. It uses multi-modal information about the user to steer when it should intervene in the creative process. We are using this system in user studies and interviews with artists to understand what modalities they would use to interact with and give feedback to a machine without disrupting their usual sense of creative workflow. This paper outlines this project’s background, Hero’s current system design, ongoing user experiments, and our planned future work to develop a mixed-initiative, multi-modal collaborative machine for creative tasks. This is a step towards bringing generative artificial intelligence into the messy complexity of physically embodied creative practice.},

At the same time, executives' academic background has an important impact on enterprises' GTI. This paper collects the word frequency data of artificial intelligence technology keywords through the jieba word segmentation function of Python software, and empirically tests the relationship between the application of artificial intelligence technology, the academic background of executives and the green technology innovation of enterprises in China's A-share listed enterprises from 2001 to 2021. The study finds that the application of artificial intelligence technology can effectively promote the ability of enterprises to improve the green technology innovation, and the higher the proportion of academic executives is, the stronger the role of the application of artificial intelligence technology in promoting the green technology innovation ability is. This study provides empirical evidence for exploring the application of artificial intelligence technology to achieve high-quality development from the perspective of executive personal characteristics.},

  abstract = {Lights out! With the escalating climate crisis, eco-feedback has gained prominence over the last decade. However, traditional approaches could be underperforming as they often use data-driven strategies and assume that people only need additional information about their consumption to change behavior. A proposed path to overcome this issue is to design eco-feedback to foster emotional connections with users. However, not much is known about the effectiveness of such designs. In this paper, we propose a novel care-based eco-feedback system. Central to the system is a Tamagotchi-inspired digital character named Infi who gets its life force from the user’s energy savings. Additionally, we harness the latest advancements in generative artificial intelligence to enhance emotional attachment through conversational interactions that users can have with Infi. The results of a randomized controlled experiment (N=420) convey the fact that this design increases emotional attachment, which in turn increases energy-saving behavior.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development and the various applications of artificial intelligence technology has been gradually replacing many labor-intensive and creative tasks. Traditional design education in schools invests considerable time in cultivating students' basic skills in using techniques, tools, materials, etc., but overlooks the wave which has been brought by artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence has surpassed human performance in specific fields and is poised to replace the work of many laborers. As artificial intelligence technology advances, its applications will permeate more areas, including thinking and creative abilities that humans have taken pride in. Design education in universities should re-examine the design values of human designers and artificial intelligence respectively. This redefinition of values implies that the abilities required of designers need to be reframed. Design education in universities should also explore how to integrate artificial intelligence-related technologies into current design curricula. New design courses must manifest the value of human designers. Furthermore, design programs offered by universities should begin planning training courses on collaborative design with artificial intelligence and establish relevant mechanisms for making artificial intelligence an effective tool to assist designers. In addition to redefining the value of designers and planning artificial intelligence-assisted design courses, design departments should monitor industry trends and gather year-by-year feedback to provide students with up-to-date career development advice. We should recognize the crisis that artificial intelligence presents to current design education and address the impact of this wave on design students. Artificial intelligence is progressing toward an irreversible trend, and the growth and transformation of designers will become a new challenge for future design education.},

Our analysis revealed that GAI would reduce the demand for teachers, weaken the teacher-student tie, and exacerbate the students’ digital overdependence, causing conflicts in data ethics and intellectual property. Thus, recommendations are made here for the four parties involved in the research: the government should formulate laws to strengthen network supervision; schools need to advance the digital reform on talent training models; teachers need to keep up with the latest educational theories to shift their roles; and students need to remain critical and independent thinkers in the age of educational digitalization 2.0.},

This paper investigates both teachers’ perspectives and attitudes toward students using ChatGPT and the students’ view of their perceived learning. Insights were gathered through questionnaires (for both students and teachers) and a learning session for students, revealing concerns and enthusiasm regarding ChatGPT’s integration. Teachers express a lack of understanding on incorporating ChatGPT into education and perceive a lack of support from school leadership and the Swedish National Agency for Education. Identified scenarios suggest ChatGPT’s potential for understanding concepts, but resistance toward its use in examinations. The students have a statistically significant enhancement in confidence and understanding of magnetism concepts after engaging with ChatGPT. This research contributes to ongoing discussions about integrating AI tools in education, emphasizing benefits and addressing ethical concerns and learning outcomes.},

  abstract = {Through the mechanism of propagating and aggregating information, graph neural networks have achieved impressive results in link prediction tasks. However, the higher-order patterns (higher-order links) prediction task is still challenging. The conventional idea directly expands existing methods used in pairwise relationship prediction. Information propagation is limited to local neighborhoods and the evaluation basis uses only the similarity between pairs of nodes. These methods fail to consider the underlying driving factors of higher-order formation processes. Therefore, a key strategy is introducing a driving factor that helps information propagation beyond the local scope and provides a global comparable criterion between multiple nodes. Cluster structure is one crucial driving factor observed in networks, where nodes within the same cluster exhibit similar behaviors and tend to form higher-order patterns. To this end, we use Clustering Information as a Driving factor for graph structure adjustments in Graph Convolutional Network (CIDGCN). CIDGCN uses clustering information to facilitate the prediction of higher-order patterns. It also extends the propagation of node information to the cluster level for Graph Convolutional Network to perform message-passing. Finally, we obtain more reliable features for higher-order patterns. CIDGCN is experimentally compared to four higher-order benchmarks, revealing its superiority in accurately predicting higher-order patterns.},

  abstract = {Before the advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, for example, ChatGPT, students traditionally approached assignment development authentically by employing libraries and by referring to textbooks. However, with the widespread reliance on powerful AI tools for assignment completion, the process has become more convenient. Unfortunately, this ease of use has led to a potential detriment in students' genuine understanding of subjects, as well as a decline in their problem-solving and innovative thinking skills. Moreover, AI tools like ChatGPT will evolve as technology advances such that the need to detect AI-generated content is even more crucial in educational setting to reinforce the value of original work [5]. This paper aims to address this issue by focusing on the detection of plagiarism in student assignments through the utilization of the Copyleaks1 tool, specifically designed to identify AI-generated code. The accuracy of the tool is systematically evaluated by submitting various pairs of codes, each with similar functionality, wherein one is generated by AI and the other by humans.},

However, in the post-pandemic era, the shared mobility sector is grappling with a crisis of trust, particularly concerning passenger hesitancy towards shared transportation options. To address those problems, in this paper we take social network into consideration and propose a novel carpooling matching framework based on graph neural network and reinforcement learning, increasing the carpooling rate to 48\%, and reducing the average delay time to 6.1 minutes and the average detour distance to 2.8 km. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative metric, termed 'tolerance' for mobility sheduling models to effectively quantify users' sensitivity to social distancing. We conduct a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate that our model offers a viable approach to amplify the benefits, delivering resilient strategies for the advancement and proliferation of shared mobility incentives.},

  abstract = {The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced a monumental shift with the emerging of Generative AI (GenAI), which has demonstrated to be a transformative tool across diverse sectors. GenAI outputs can span various digital formats, including text, images, videos, and audio, generating particular interest in the public sector. The growing interest of governments in integrating GenAI technologies in public sector operations is marked by the creation of emerging governance instruments and the formulation of soft laws, like standards, principles, and guidelines. This study aims to delve into the intricacies and potential risks associated with the deployment of GenAI within government. Through a qualitative content analysis, the research meticulously examines GenAI usage guidelines issued by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and South Korea. The objective is to discern the risks acknowledged by these countries' soft laws and compare them with the risks identified by scholars in the field. The performed comparative analysis across countries suggest that the use of GenAI in the public sector raises common risks such as information leakage, data privacy, security, and concerns over public trust. By elucidating the varied risk perceptions across different national contexts, this study provides theoretical and practical implications related to the risks of GenAI within the public sector. Moreover, it sets a foundation for future research and policy development, ensuring that generative AI is used as a force for good in public governance.},

A crucial factor for fake news to go viral on social media is that users share such content. Here, we aim to shed light on the sharing behavior of users across human-generated vs. AI-generated fake news. Specifically, we study: (1) What is the perceived veracity of human-generated fake news vs. AI-generated fake news? (2) What is the user's willingness to share human-generated fake news vs. AI-generated fake news on social media? (3) What socio-economic characteristics let users fall for AI-generated fake news? To this end, we conducted a pre-registered, online experiment with N= 988 subjects and 20 fake news from the COVID-19 pandemic generated by GPT-4 vs. humans. Our findings show that AI-generated fake news is perceived as less accurate than human-generated fake news, but both tend to be shared equally. Further, several socio-economic factors explain who falls for AI-generated fake news.},

However, previous peer support CAs either are user-initiated or follow predefined rules to initiate the conversations, which may discourage users to engage and build relationships with the CAs for long-term benefits. In this paper, we develop ComPeer , a generative CA that can proactively offer adaptive peer support to users. ComPeer leverages large language models to detect and reflect significant events in the dialogue, enabling it to strategically plan the timing and content of proactive care. In addition, ComPeer incorporates peer support strategies, conversation history, and its persona into the generative messages. Our one-week between-subjects study (N=24) demonstrates ComPeer ’s strength in providing peer support over time and boosting users’ engagement compared to a baseline user-initiated CA. We report users’ interaction patterns with ComPeer and discuss implications for designing proactive generative agents to promote people’s well-being.},

This framework analyses human behaviour during the simulated emergency rescue process and collects relevant data. The module function is determined by the parallel emergency management method. The system comprises three data processing modules: the behavioural input module, the emergency event feedback module, and the data classification and processing module. The logic of AI data processing is employed to establish a data cycle evolution system, which assists rescue personnel in enhancing their professional abilities, increasing the success rate of rescue operations, and optimising the role of AI technology and computer simulation methodology in the design of the practice.},

This article explores the key issues and challenges of artificial intelligence in building English big data corpora, and proposes corresponding solutions. Firstly, we discussed the construction pattern of big data corpora. In view of this, the construction of big data corpora under artificial intelligence translation can be carried out from four aspects: sharing mode based on third-party open-source data, crowdsourcing translation, machine closed-loop learning mode, and human-machine collaboration mode. The future translation teaching can also rely on the construction of corpora as an important part of translation intelligence. By comprehensively considering these aspects, this article aims to provide comprehensive guidance and methods for the construction of English big data corpora, and promote the continuous development of artificial intelligence translation technology.},

The project integrates psychological interventions tailored for driving, drawing on automated driving advancements to ensure safety and effectiveness. Using a context-aware sensing framework, interactions are timed during appropriate driving scenarios to minimize distraction. The system obtains context data from car sensors and employs generative AI to deliver subtle interactions, enhancing user engagement and idea output without compromising safety. Evaluation includes measuring user engagement and post-drive self-reports to quantify the impact on idea generation and driving performance. This innovation integrates creativity support tools into daily commutes, potentially transforming in-car intelligence systems and enhancing productivity and innovation capabilities.},

  abstract = {Computer science curricula have started to include competencies related to artificial intelligence (AI) in K–12 education. However, before introducing a new topic into the classroom and suggesting competencies, it is essential to identify the central practices of the discipline. In the following research, we focus on identifying practices related to data, as current school curricula significantly underestimate the role of data, and understanding how data is processed is a key to understanding how AI systems function. We examine the theoretical literature on practices applied to data when creating AI systems, map the practices in a process model, validate the results of the mapping with domain experts, and contrast the results with current AI curricula for school students. The contribution of this work is a process model that summarizes data-related practices for AI systems built with machine learning, is comprehensively domain-embedded, and is aligned with K–12 education. Computer science educators can use it as a blueprint for defining competencies and designing learning arrangements that aim to enable students to create and understand AI systems.},

This paradigmatic transition emphasizes the critical role of data in AI. While past approaches centered on refining models, they often overlooked potential data imperfections, raising questions about the true potential of enhanced model performance. DCAI advocates the systematic engineering of data, complementing existing efforts and playing a vital role in driving AI success. This transition has spurred innovation in various machine learning and data mining algorithms and their applications on the Web.

Entrepreneurs from lean economies in particular are well positioned to outsource tasks to generative AI given limited resources. In this paper, we work to address a growing disparity in use of these technologies by building on a four-year partnership with a local entrepreneurial hub dedicated to equity in tech and entrepreneurship. Together, we co-designed an interactive workshops series aimed to onboard local entrepreneurs to generative AI platforms. Alongside four community-driven and iterative workshops with entrepreneurs across five months, we conducted interviews with 15 local entrepreneurs and community providers. We detail the importance of communal and supportive exposure to generative AI tools for local entrepreneurs, scaffolding actionable use (and supporting non-use), demystifying generative AI technologies by emphasizing entrepreneurial power, while simultaneously deconstructing the veneer of simplicity to address the many operational skills needed for successful application.},

This paper proposes a comprehensive technology of defect classification method for pressure gas cylinders based on on-site collection of gas cylinder defect data set. The main work is as follows: 1) Aiming at the problem of insufficient number and unbalanced distribution of field-collected defect samples, a DA-DCGAN based on the dual-channel attention mechanism is designed to increase the sample data, and a self-attention generator and a dual-channel discriminator are constructed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the generated samples; 2) Based on the augmented and broadened dataset, a design of a cascaded HRNet classification network is proposed to increase the quality of pressure gas cylinders by means of global feature extraction, and local feature extraction for feature fusion to achieve multiple classification of defects based on infrared gas cylinder images. Compared with the mainstream classification methods DenseNet, ResNet, and VGG, the cascaded HRNet method improves the average AUC by 6.1\% and achieves the highest scores in two defect types. For temperature fluctuation experiments under real working conditions, good performance is achieved, proving the effectiveness and anti-interference of the improved model.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has garnered widespread attention due to its ability to automatically generate diverse and valuable digital content. Integrating with AIGC, vehicular networks are evolving as the next-generation intelligent transportation system, i.e., vehicular Metaverses, which can significantly enrich the diverse and personalized immersive experience of vehicular applications for drivers and passengers. Nevertheless, due to the high demand for AIGC services and the limited coverage of RoadSide Units (RSUs), it is still challenging to efficiently allocate RSU resources for massive vehicular users. In this paper, we propose an attribute-aware auction-based mechanism for real-time resource allocation in vehicular AIGC services, which considers both price and non-monetary attributes. In this mechanism, we first formulate the resource-attribute matching problem as a weighted bipartite graph to determine potential market participants. Then, we train an auctioneer in a double Dutch auction using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to adjust the auction clocks efficiently during the clock adjustment process. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed DRL-based auction scheme outperforms existing baseline schemes in terms of average cumulative reward, convergence speed, social welfare, and auction information exchange costs.},

In this paper, we propose an EfficientNet-B3 network optimization model based on the CBAM attention mechanism, which significantly improves the recognition of tiny defects in solar panels by combining deep learning techniques and attention mechanisms. Experimental results show that our model exhibits high accuracy on both training and validation sets with gradually decreasing loss. The model achieves an accuracy of 95.22\% in complex and variable defect categories, which is significantly better than existing baseline models. An in-depth performance evaluation shows that the model has significant advantages in key performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 value, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in the solar panel defect recognition task.},

  abstract = {Although deep networks-based 3D reconstruction methods can recover the 3D geometry given few inputs, they may produce unfaithful reconstruction when predicting occluded parts of 3D objects. To address the issue, we propose Detail-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (DEGAN) which consists of Encoder–Decoder-Based Generator (EDGen) and Voxel-Point Embedding Network-Based Discriminator (VPDis) for 3D reconstruction from a monocular depth image of an object. Firstly, EDGen decodes the features from the 2.5D voxel grid representation of an input depth image and generates the 3D occupancy grid under GAN losses and a sampling point loss. The sampling loss can improve the accuracy of predicted points with high uncertainty. VPDis helps reconstruct the details under voxel and point adversarial losses, respectively. Experimental results show that DEGAN not only outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on both public ModelNet and ShapeNet datasets but also predicts more reliable occluded/missing parts of 3D objects.},

  abstract = {In order to make the elderly care service system intelligent, this paper proposes a human posture recognition algorithm based on big data analysis and artificial intelligence technology. The algorithm framework includes three parts: human target detection, human posture estimation and human action recognition. Firstly, this paper adopts the obscured human body detection algorithm based on the mixed attention mechanism to detect the human bounding box. Then, to solve the problem that the detected human bounding box may have inaccurate positioning leading to the human body position deviation, the space transformation network is used to affine the coordinates of the human bounding box to correct its position. Finally, the stacked hourglass network is used to predict the joints of the detected human body, so as to realize the recognition of human posture. In this paper, the algorithm is trained and tested on the open pedestrian test set. The experimental results show that the algorithm in this paper can effectively and correctly estimate the visible parts of human posture, and reduce the influence of obstacle occlusion on human posture estimation and human fall detection. The evaluation index of human posture recognition (Kps AP) reached 68.7\%, indicating that the posture recognition algorithm proposed in this paper can realize the rapid recognition and estimation of human posture without shelter, and the algorithm can complete the fall recognition of the elderly in the elderly service system, and can effectively prevent the elderly from falling after the subsequent big data statistics and analysis of the elderly's posture. It has good practicability.},

With the advancement of medical informatization, traditional nursing information collection methods face challenges such as large data volume and slow processing speed. The introduction of big data analysis algorithms can significantly improve these problems and provide more accurate nursing data support. In this paper, we first designed a node deployment model based on big data analysis and optimized the collection algorithm of multi-feature fusion to improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of data collection. Secondly, relevant technologies such as C/S mode, B/S mode and WAP platform are analyzed to explore their application in nursing information collection system. In terms of system design, a perfect software and network architecture is constructed to ensure the stability and efficiency of the system. The effectiveness of the system is verified through simulation experiments, and the results show that the system can significantly improve the efficiency of nursing information collection and provide powerful data support for nursing management.},

Virtual reality involves the use and synthesis of computers, computer information and simulation technology. It is based on the latest high-tech developments in the use of computer technology, 3D graphics technology, multimedia technology, simulation technology, imaging technology, servo technology and other equipment to create a realistic 3D visual, tactile, olfactory and other sensory experience Virtual worlds create for people who are in them a sense of immersion. With the continuous development of social productivity and science and technology, the demand for virtual reality technology is growing in all walks of life, and virtual reality technology has made great strides and is gradually becoming a new field of science and technology. This paper first introduces artificial intelligence (AI), VR and interactive products, and then proves the progressiveness of AI based VR interactive product software through experiments (the interface interaction deviation is about 0.1 in the xyz axis, far lower than other VR interactive products).},

As more creative tools begin to incorporate generative artificial intelligence, I propose a research agenda that centers the design of human-AI co-creation experiences on disabled creators and leverages such technology for accessibility from the start. Specifically, I focus on researching ways that AI-assisted creative tools could be designed to lift the expression ceiling and reduce effort for blind and low vision creators. Starting with a formative mixed-method study that uncovers the blind and low vision community's needs for visual content creation and editing support, this dissertation explores and designs accessible content creation support for three highly desired visual creative tasks: (1) private visual content obfuscation, (2) social media video editing, and (3) aesthetic visual content authoring. Together, I believe this dissertation will contribute actionable insights to lower the barriers to expressive and efficient digital content creation for blind and low vision creators.},

  abstract = {We are concurrently witnessing two significant shifts: voice and chat-based conversational user interfaces (CUIs) are becoming ubiquitous (especially more recently due to advances in generative AI and LLMs - large language models), and older people are becoming a very large demographic group (and increasingly adopting of mobile technology on which such interfaces are present). However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research.},

To address these problems, we present ''DevCoach'', an online system designed to support students learning the SDLC at scale by interacting with generative agents powered by large language models simulating members with different roles in a software development team. Our preliminary user study results reveal that DevCoach improves the experiences and outcomes for students, with regard to learning concepts in SDLC's ''Plan and Design'' and ''Develop'' phases. We aim to use our findings to enhance DevCoach to support the entire SDLC workflow by incorporating additional simulated roles and enabling students to choose their project topics. Future studies will be conducted in an online Software Engineering class at our institution, aiming to explore and inspire the development of intelligent systems that provide comprehensive SDLC learning experiences to students at scale.},

One of the domains extensively explored for these models is their ability as generators of functional source code for software projects. Nevertheless, their potential as assistants to write the code needed to generate and model Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) architectures has not been fully explored to date. For this reason, this work focuses on evaluating the extent to which different tools based on GLLMs, such as ChatGPT or Copilot, are able to correctly define the source code necessary to generate viable predictive models. The use case defined is the forecasting of a time series that reports the indoor temperature of a greenhouse. The results indicate that, while it is possible to achieve good accuracy metrics with simple predictive models generated by GLLMs, the composition of predictive models with complex architectures using GLLMs is still far from improving the accuracy of predictive models generated by human data scientists.},

The study involved testing twelve sleep patterns representing safe sleeping positions and six patterns simulating scenarios with a risk of falling. The system demonstrated remarkable accuracy in detecting fall risks, triggering warnings and alarms when key points associated with falling were not detected. Importantly, the system avoided false alarms caused by incorrect detections.

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education not only changes the education model but also transforms the role of teachers from traditional "knowledge transmitters" to "learning guides" and "skills trainers". This transformation underscores the importance of teachers in leveraging AI for educational enhancement and professional growth, highlighting the need for improved AI competencies. We adhere to human-centered principles and follow ethical and responsible AI ethical standards to ensure that technology truly serves education. Through a literature review from an international perspective, this study examines global trends in AI educational practices, comparing policies, curricula, and research across Asia, Europe, and Africa. This comparison facilitates a deep understanding of AI's application and challenges within various cultural and educational settings, offering insights into enhancing teacher's AI competencies. The paper concludes by suggesting a detailed strategy for bolstering teachers' AI skills, employing a stepwise approach to foster professional development and elevate educational quality in the AI era while providing guidance for teachers to use AI critically and transformatively.},

  abstract = {Recommendation systems provide personalized content and product recommendations by analyzing user behavior and preferences. However, the accuracy and reliability of such recommendations rely heavily on large amounts of historical datasets, predictive models, and the final recommended content, which may involve users' personal privacy. This raises an important question: How can we ensure the accuracy and reliability of recommendation content without compromising user privacy? To address this issue, researchers have proposed various privacy-preserving techniques, including anonymization, federated learning, and differential privacy. However, these techniques often involve a trade-off between privacy protection and data utility. For instance, excessive anonymization may reduce the availability of data. In this paper, we propose a Differential Privacy Generative Adversarial Network in Recommendation Systems model (DP-GAN), which enhances the protection of user privacy while improving the recommendation performance of generated synthetic data in recommendation systems. Specifically, the generator generates synthetic data similar to the features of the real data distribution and uses Gumbel-softmax sampling to fix the length of the generated synthetic data, ensuring that it is difficult to infer personal information even in the case of data leakage. To further enhance privacy protection, we introduce differential privacy noise during the generation process. We conducted extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate that our model provides good recommendation performance while protecting user privacy with the generated synthetic data.},

  abstract = {The industrial revolution (4.0) has seen a rapid advancement in technology. The existence of machine learning and artificial intelligence is one of them. By automating most audit processes with AI, auditors can increase efficiency and accuracy. AI-powered technology reduces human error risk while speeding up the auditing process. The outcome is more timely and accurate information sent to the management. Nonetheless, auditors were still using artificial intelligence and machine learning in very small amounts. Furthermore, specialized research on this subject is still scarce. We wish to investigate this research gap. We study what influences artificial intelligence and machine learning adoption by auditors. Based on Diffusion of Innovation Theory, we employ constructs or variables. Structural equation modeling partial least squares is used in data analysis for our quantitative research. By giving questionnaires to Jakarta public accounting firms' auditors, we can gather primary data. We use the statistical method of partial least squares for structural equation modeling when analyzing data. The software we use is SMART PLS version 4. The findings of our study show that the relative advantage, compatibility, trialability, and observability of each have a big impact on the auditor's adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning.},

Current text-to-audio models offer a novel method of defining sounds, which we aim to render utilizable in a music-production environment. Selected pretrained latent diffusion models, enable the synthesis of playable sounds through textual descriptions, which we incorporated into a digital instrument that integrates with standard music production tools. The resultant user interface not only allows generating but also modifying the sounds by editing model and instrument-specific parameters. We evaluated the applicability of current diffusion models with their parameters as well as the fitness of possible prompts for music production scenarios. Adapting published diffusion model pipelines for integration into the instrument, we facilitate experimentation and exploration of this innovative sound synthesis method. Our findings show that despite facing some limitations in the models' responsiveness to specific music production contexts and the instrument's functionality, the tool allows the development of novel and intriguing soundscapes.

This paper explores the idea of a Ditto—an agent that visually resembles a person, sounds like them, possesses knowledge about them, and can represent them in meetings. This paper reports on results from two empirical investigations: 1) focus group sessions with six groups (n=24) and 2) a Wizard of Oz (WOz) study with 10 groups (n=39) recruited from within a large technology company. Results from the focus group sessions provide insights on what contexts are appropriate for Dittos, and issues around social acceptability and representation risk. The focus group results also provide feedback on visual design characteristics for Dittos. In the WOz study, teams participated in meetings with two different embodied agents: a Ditto and a Delegate (an agent which did not resemble the absent person). Insights from this research demonstrate the impact these embodied agents can have in meetings and highlight that Dittos in particular show promise in evoking feelings of presence and trust, as well as informing decision making. These results also highlight issues related to relationship dynamics such as maintaining social etiquette, managing one's professional reputation, and upholding accountability. Overall, our investigation provides early evidence that Dittos could be beneficial to represent users when they are unable to be present but also outlines many factors that need to be carefully considered to successfully realize this vision.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Increased use of generative artificial intelligence or AI in various academic activities such as programming is a significant milestone in technology diffusion in learning. To bring AI closer to how programmers think, behave, and interact, it is imperative for research to establish a clear connection between various human factors that lead to its adoption. Using a model based on the Theory of Reasoned Action, we positioned human traits of academic stress, risk propensity, neuroticism, and computer self-efficacy as factors that positively influence attitudes toward the use of AI in programming among university students. We further posited that attitude and social norms lead to the behavioral intention to use AI in programming. We used PLS-SEM to analyze responses from 131 programming students who use ChatGPT to accomplish learning tasks. We found that both academic stress and computer self-efficacy influence attitudes toward using AI in programming. While attitude positively influences the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT, we found that risk propensity and neuroticism do not affect attitude, and social norms do not influence behavioral intention. We discuss the implications of our investigation to the industry and the academe.},

RAG extends the capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, without the need to retrain the model. On the other hand, Fine-Tuning approach updates LLM weights with domain-specific data to improve performance on specific tasks. The fine-tuned model is particularly effective to systematically learn new comprehensive knowledge in a specific domain that is not covered by the LLM pre-training. This tutorial walks through the RAG and Fine-Tuning techniques, discusses the insights of their advantages and limitations, and provides best practices of adopting the methodologies for the LLM tasks and use cases. The hands-on labs demonstrate the advanced techniques to optimize the RAG and fine-tuned LLM architecture that handles domain specific LLM tasks. The labs in the tutorial are designed by using a set of open-source python libraries to implement the RAG and fine-tuned LLM architecture.},

  abstract = {The boom in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and continuing growth of Voice Assistants (VAs) suggests their trajectories will converge. This conjecture aligns with the development of AI-driven conversational agents, aiming to utilise advance natural language processing (NLP) methods to enhance the capabilities of voice assistants. However, design guidelines for VAs prioritise maximum efficiency by advocating for the use of concise answers. This poses a conflict with the challenges around generative AI, such as inaccuracies and misinterpretation, as shorter responses may not adequately provide users with meaningful information. AI-VA systems can adapt drivers of trust formation, such as references and authorship, to improve credibility. A better understanding of user behaviour when using the system is needed to develop revised design recommendations for AI-powered VA systems. This paper reports an online survey of 256 participants residing in the U.K. and nine follow-up interviews, where user behaviour is investigated to identify drivers of trust in the context of obtaining digital information from a generative AI-based VA system. Adding references is promising as a tool for increasing trust in systems producing text, yet we found no evidence that the inclusion of references in a VA response contributed towards the perceived reliability or trust towards the system. We examine further variables driving user trust in AI-powered VA systems.},

  abstract = {Most recent algorithms of RGB-T salient object detection have two issues remain unresolved. The first one is that existing methods don't fully explore and exploit the potentials of complementary of different modalities and multi-type cues of images, which play a vital role in achieving accurate results. And the second is that it is difficult to determine which of the two modalities contributes more in the feature fusion stage.To address these problems, we propose a dual-decoder importance-aware gated network called LNet. Specifically, we set the dual-decoder architecture to solve the cross-modality interaction problem. It can dig out the characteristics of two modalities, and fuse the cross-modality complementarity information more effectively. In particular, the importance-aware gated part Screening Mechanism (SM) can suppress saliency bias and let model avoid obtaining the results dominated by one modality.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LNet achieves better performance than the 11 state-of-the-art on three public datasets.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is versatile for various applications, but security and privacy concerns with third-party AI vendors hinder its broader adoption in sensitive scenarios. Hence, it is essential for users to validate the AI trustworthiness and ensure the security of data boundaries. In this paper, we present a dye testing system named Dye4AI, which injects crafted trigger data into human-AI dialogue and observes AI responses towards specific prompts to diagnose data flow in AI model evolution. Our dye testing procedure contains 3 stages: trigger generation, trigger insertion, and trigger retrieval. First, to retain both uniqueness and stealthiness, we design a new trigger that transforms a pseudo-random number to a intelligible format. Second, with a custom-designed three-step conversation strategy, we insert each trigger item into dialogue and confirm the model memorizes the new trigger knowledge in the current session. Finally, we routinely try to recover triggers with specific prompts in new sessions, as triggers can present in new sessions only if AI vendors leverage user data for model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on six LLMs demonstrate our dye testing scheme is effective in ensuring the data boundary, even for models with various architectures and parameter sizes. Also, larger and premier models tend to be more suitable for Dye4AI, e.g., trigger can be retrieved in OpenLLaMa-13B even with only 2 insertions per trigger item. Moreover, we analyze the prompt selection in dye testing, providing insights for future testing systems on generative AI services.},

There is limited prior research on computing students' use and perceptions of GenAI. In anticipation of future advances and evolutions of GenAI, we capture a snapshot of student attitudes towards and uses of yet emerging GenAI, in a period of time before university policies had reacted to these technologies. We surveyed all computer science majors in a small engineering-focused R1 university in order to: (1) capture a baseline assessment of how GenAI has been immediately adopted by aspiring computer scientists; (2) describe computing students' GenAI-related needs and concerns for their education and careers; and (3) discuss GenAI influences on CS pedagogy, curriculum, culture, and policy. We present an exploratory qualitative analysis of this data and discuss the impact of our findings on the emerging conversation around GenAI and education.},

  abstract = {AI/ML techniques have been used to solve systems problems, but their applicability to customize solutions on-the-fly has been limited. Traditionally, any customization required manually changing the AI/ML model or modifying the code, configuration parameters, application settings, etc. This incurs too much time and effort, and is very painful. In this paper, we propose a novel technique using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology, wherein instructions can be provided in natural language and actual code to handle any customization is automatically generated, integrated and applied on-the-fly. Such capability is extremely powerful since it makes customization of application settings or solution techniques super easy. Specifically, we propose ECO-LLM (LLM-based Edge Cloud Optimization), which leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to dynamically adjust placement of application tasks across edge and cloud computing tiers, in response to changes in application workload, such that insights are delivered quickly with low cost of operation (systems problem). Our experiments with real-world video analytics applications i.e. face recognition, human attributes detection and license plate recognition show that ECO-LLM is able to automatically generate code on-the-fly and adapt placement of application tasks across edge and cloud computing tiers. We note that the trigger workload (to switch between edge and cloud) for ECO-LLM is exactly the same as the baseline (manual) and actual placement performed by ECO-LLM is only slightly different i.e. on average (across 2 days) only 1.45\% difference in human attributes detection and face recognition, and 1.11\% difference in license plate recognition. Although we tackle this specific systems problem in this paper, our proposed GenAI-based technique is applicable to solve other systems problems too.},

  abstract = {As deep learning technology in computer science develops, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has shown great potential in automated essay scoring (AES). Prompts and time are important factors which may influence the performance of GenAI. The study selected 52 English argumentative essays, designed five different prompts, chooses two different time points, and then utilized ChatGPT 4 to explore the effects of prompts and time on AES by GenAI. Besides, possible reasons for large difference between human and GenAI score were discussed.For different prompts, results show that the one-shot prompt performs better in AES compared with the other four prompts. It provides background information and a scoring example to ChatGPT. The scores generated by it do not significantly differ from the human scores. They significantly and positively correlate with human scores (ρ = 0.424). The exact-plus-adjacent agreement (EPAA) rate for one-shot prompt scores reaches 69.23\%. For scores generated at different points in time, results reveal that although there is still a significant difference between scores generated after one week and human scores, the ChatGPT-Human EPAA rate becomes higher and the absolute value of mean score difference is smaller.Based on the analysis of selected essays, the major reason for large GenAI-Human score difference is that ChatGPT evaluates essays from limited perspectives to give its score, while human raters can comprehensively assess the quality of an essay. What's more, ChatGPT cannot keep the same scoring criteria during the rating process.The study aims to help people understand how to interact with GenAI more efficiently and take advantage of GenAI to meet the practical needs.},

Conversational agents developed for HFA children in previous studies show limitations in children's learning effectiveness due to the conversational agents’ inability to dynamically generate personalized and contextual content. Recent advanced generative Artificial Intelligence techniques, with the capability to generate substantial diverse and high-quality texts and visual content, offer an opportunity for personalized assistance in emotional learning for HFA children. Based on the findings of our formative study, we integrated large language models and text-to-image models to develop a tool named EmoEden supporting children with HFA. Over a 22-day study involving six HFA children, it is observed that EmoEden effectively engaged children and improved their emotional recognition and expression abilities. Additionally, we identified the advantages and potential risks of applying generative AI to assist HFA children in emotional learning.},

It also contributes to establishing a robust human-machine interactive relationship, albeit accompanied by certain ethical risks. This study employs emotional measurement experiments and eye-tracking technology. By analyzing individuals' assessments of emotional mixed-image collections and correlating the results with experimental eye-tracking data and dominant color patterns within the images, the paper investigates the accuracy of AI-generated tools in transcribing emotional nuances.

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as deep learning (DL) have demonstrated their strong abilities in various areas, including language, vision, remote sensing (RS), and agrifood systems applications. However, the overall impact of AI on agrifood systems remains unclear. In this article, we thoroughly review how AI techniques can transform agrifood systems and contribute to the modern agrifood industry. First, we summarize the data acquisition methods in agrifood systems, including acquisition, storage, and processing techniques. Second, we present a progress review of AI methods in agrifood systems, specifically in agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishery, covering topics such as agrifood classification, growth monitoring, yield prediction, and quality assessment. Furthermore, we highlight potential challenges and promising research opportunities for transforming modern agrifood systems with AI. We hope this survey can offer an overall picture to newcomers in the field and serve as a starting point for their further research.

  abstract = {As an indispensable and easily damaged part in large equipment, bearings were of great significance for their rapid and accurate fault diagnosis. The working environment of bearings was usually harsh and complicated. In order to improve the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis under strong noise, an improved IRGShuffleNet network structure was proposed. The initial multi-scale structure based on LIBP was innovatively used to extract the shallow feature information of the network. Features were extracted from high-dimensional data using the inverted residual structure, and redundant feature maps were generated in a cheaper way by Ghost convolution. Random depth structure and flooding regularization were used to prevent overfitting of the model. To evaluate the validity of the proposed model, a series of comparative experiments were conducted. Compared with the standard residual network, the accuracy of the model proposed in this paper was improved by 5.90\% and 9.72\% respectively under -4dB and -10dB noise. The model parameter was reduced from 25.7M to 1.98M, FLOPs were reduced by about 75.2\%, and other performance indicators were also improved at different amplitudes. These results showed that the proposed model had good diagnostic adaptability.},

In particular, text-to-image generation models offer a novel approach to guiding the image generation process using natural language input, which is inspiring for multimodal search advertising. Traditional multimodal search ads require advertisers to prepare ad creatives, such as ad images, which is time-consuming and requires uniform image specifications and content quality inspection. To this end, we propose a streamlined generation framework for search ad image creatives. First, we prepare a Chinese image caption model with high-quality image-caption pairs to bootstrap training data refinement. With curated high-quality images and synthesized descriptive captions, we then train a Chinese text-to-image generation model, the largest to date, using SDXL and a 10-billion multimodal text encoder. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage bilingual multimodal representation alignment process to seamlessly integrate the text encoder with the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, including assessments of image captioning and image generation. The implementation of our framework in Baidu Search Ads shows significant revenue increase, For example, beauty industry ads with generated image creatives achieve a 29\% higher click-through rate (CTR).},

  abstract = {In recent years, the application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in financial analysis and investment decision-making has gained significant attention. However, most existing approaches rely on single-agent systems, which fail to fully utilize the collaborative potential of multiple AI agents. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent collaboration system designed to enhance decision-making in financial investment research. The system incorporates agent groups with both configurable group sizes and collaboration structures to leverage the strengths of each agent group type. By utilizing a sub-optimal combination strategy, the system dynamically adapts to varying market conditions and investment scenarios, optimizing performance across different tasks. We focus on three sub-tasks: fundamentals, market sentiment, and risk analysis, by analyzing the 2023 SEC 10-K forms of 30 companies listed on the Dow Jones Index. Our findings reveal significant performance variations based on the configurations of AI agents for different tasks. The results demonstrate that our multi-agent collaboration system outperforms traditional single-agent models, offering improved accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability in complex financial environments. This study highlights the potential of multi-agent systems in transforming financial analysis and investment decision-making by integrating diverse analytical perspectives.},

  abstract = {This work focuses on applying explainable artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve the interpretability and reliability of models in two crucial scenarios: detecting collusion in public procurement auctions and identifying corruption in public contracts in Mexico. While these challenges are specific, the need for transparency and explainability in AI systems is universal, especially when it comes to high-impact government issues. Our analysis is based on case studies of these particular applications, highlighting how interpretability techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can be used to provide crucial insights into decisions of the algorithms involved. In doing so, our paper seeks to contribute to a broader understanding of how explainable AI can be applied in diverse government contexts. Additionally, we explore the ethical and practical implications of explainable AI in governance, highlighting its ability to promote greater transparency, accountability, and trust in automated decisions. By the end of this study, we hope to provide a more comprehensive view on how explainable AI can be a valuable tool in improving public governance, not only in relation to cases of collusion and corruption, but also in a wide range of critical government applications.},

  abstract = {The rise in capability and ubiquity of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has enabled its application to the field of Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs). Despite significant interest in leveraging modern AI-powered components in real-time SIA research, substantial friction remains due to the absence of a standardized and universal SIA framework. As such, we developed Estuary: a multimodal (text, audio, and soon video) framework which facilitates the development of low-latency, real-time SIAs. Estuary seeks to reduce repeat work between studies and to provide a flexible platform that can be run entirely off-cloud to maximize configurability, controllability, reproducibility of studies, and speed of agent response times. We achieve this by constructing a robust multimodal framework which incorporates current and future components seamlessly into a modular and interoperable architecture.},

The paper summarizes research on the difficulties AI has while reading ESL text, emphasizing the need for high-quality training data and algorithm development. Although AI has the ability to provide individualized learning experiences, there are unknowns when it comes to data that is outside of its training set. The review highlights the need for more thorough research by exposing a lack of high-quality evidence on the results of AI integration. While AI is recognized for its ability to track student progress and provide feedback, the effectiveness of these efforts depends on the choice of suitable AI-driven learning models.

  abstract = {Persuasive technologies, which are intended to change users’ attitudes or behaviors and encourage specific actions, are widely applied across various domains. However, the fine line between persuasion and coercion raises significant ethical concerns, which current literature only superficially addresses. This paper aims to deepen the understanding of factors influencing the ethical perception of persuasive technologies through a systematic literature review of 17 journal articles. The selected studies were analyzed using content analysis to identify key ethical factors. The findings indicate that factors such as autonomy, consent, data privacy, transparency, and addictive design strategies significantly influence users’ ethical perceptions across multiple application domains. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies or AI agents, particularly applications like argumentative chatbots and storytelling robots, exhibit the highest number of ethical considerations. The study also notes thematic overlaps among many ethical factors, with the context and use case impacting ethical perceptions. Based on these results, this paper offers design recommendations and suggestions for the design of ethical persuasive technology applications.},

  abstract = {Designing effective cybersecurity visualization has become a crucial component of cyber defense strategies in many domains and industrial environments. Human behaviour, modeling and input are major aspects of designing visualization systems. Yet, the task of evaluating these developed visualization systems is both time-consuming and challenging, and it is often prone to cases where user evaluation is limited owing to a lack of different stakeholders and end users during the design process. Recognizing the potential of advanced Generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs), our study aims to explore their capabilities in evaluating web-based security visualization tools and dashboards, particularly in the context of smart cities and buildings. We study and compare the feasibility of using various LLMs available today, for conducting usability testing, serving as an additional resource given the limited availability of human participants. In particular, we focus on three different LLMs: Bing Chat, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4o. While each had its strengths and drawbacks, our findings revealed that the results obtained had a strong correlation with human test subjects. LLMs can be a valuable aid during evaluation, by offering in-depth insights and evaluations, tailored to the specific requirements of smart buildings, cities and automation cybersecurity. Moreover, our research and findings also reveal that LLMs can similarly be used for the evaluation of a wide range of other visual systems for industrial environments.},

  abstract = {The rapidly increasing amount of online information and the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) make the manual verification of information impractical. Consequently, AI systems are deployed to detect disinformation and deepfakes. Prior studies have indicated that combining AI and human capabilities yields enhanced performance in detecting disinformation. Furthermore, the European Union (EU) AI Act mandates human supervision for AI applications in areas impacting essential human rights, like freedom of speech, necessitating that AI systems be transparent and provide adequate explanations to ensure comprehensibility. Extensive research has been conducted on incorporating explainability (XAI) attributes to augment AI transparency, yet these often miss a human-centric assessment. The effectiveness of such explanations also varies with the user’s prior knowledge and personal attributes. Therefore, we developed a framework for validating XAI features for the collaborative human-AI fact-checking task. The framework allows the testing of XAI features with objective and subjective evaluation dimensions and follows human-centric design principles when displaying information about the AI system to the users. The framework was tested in a crowdsourcing experiment with 433 participants, including 406 crowdworkers and 27 journalists for the collaborative disinformation detection task. The tested XAI features increase the AI system’s perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust. With this publication, the XAI evaluation framework is made open source.},

  abstract = {The employment of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning models across diverse domains has grown exponentially in recent years. These models undertake critical tasks spanning medical diagnoses, criminal sentencing, and loan approvals. Consequently, there is a need for these models to be interpretable, enabling users to grasp the rationale behind predictions and engendering trust. Equally vital is the capability of developers to pinpoint and rectify any erroneous behaviors. In this context emerges the field of Explainable AI (XAI), which aims to develop methods to make ML models more interpretable while maintaining their performance level. Various methods have been proposed, many leveraging visual explanations to elucidate model behavior. However, a notable gap remains: a lack of rigorous assessment regarding the effectiveness of these explanations in enhancing interpretability. In this paper, we evaluate whether the SHAP method, widely used in the XAI field, achieves its objective of making a model more interpretable. We conducted a study based on the concept of simulatability. We asked participants who have mathematical or statistical backgrounds and intermediate to advanced knowledge of machine learning and model interpretability to classify some given instances of a dataset, presented first without the explanations provided by the SHAP method and then with them. The goal was to assess whether the explanation made the participants better at classifying the instances. Our findings reveal that the visualizations can be confusing even for users with a mathematical background. Additionally, we argue that there is a need for XAI researchers to work collaboratively with visual analytics experts to develop these visualizations, as well as test the visualizations with users of various backgrounds.},

Existing image privacy protection techniques, like blurring, often struggle to maintain the balance between robust privacy protection and preserving image usability. To address this, we introduce a generative content replacement (GCR) method in image privacy protection, which seamlessly substitutes privacy-threatening contents with similar and realistic substitutes, using state-of-the-art generative techniques. Compared with four prevalent image protection methods, GCR consistently exhibited low detectability, making the detection of edits remarkably challenging. GCR also performed reasonably well in hindering the identification of specific content and managed to sustain the image’s narrative and visual harmony. This research serves as a pilot study and encourages further innovation on GCR and the development of tools that enable human-in-the-loop image privacy protection using approaches similar to GCR.},

To achieve our purpose, we utilize Bayesian deep learning and uncertainty-aware planning, which allow us to create visual indicators to demonstrate how autonomous agents perceive their surroundings and take action. We use a reinforcement learning method called DQN with uncertainty and compare the results with four other baseline algorithms: DQN, DDQN with Prioritised Replay, Dueling DDQN and DDQN. Our findings show that the uncertainty estimate can generate a more efficient and stable decision-making model. To explain the behaviour of our agent, we suggest an interface that displays the current view of the environment, the agent's view, Q-values for each possible action, state value, a heatmap relative to the agent's input, and a visual representation of the uncertainty connected with each Q-value. Our approach can enhance the human understanding of the algorithm's decision-making process and confidence in its performance.},

  abstract = {The rising adoption of learning analytics and academic performance prediction technologies in higher education highlights the urgent need for transparency and explainability. This demand, rooted in ethical concerns and fairness considerations, converges with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) principles. Despite the recognized importance of transparency and fairness in learning analytics, empirical studies examining student fairness perceptions, particularly within academic performance prediction, remain limited. We conducted a pre-registered factorial survey experiment involving 1,047 German students to investigate how decision tree features (simplicity and accuracy) influence perceived distributive and informational fairness, mediated by causability (i.e., the self-assessed understandability of a machine learning model’s cause-effect linkages). Additionally, we examined the moderating role of institutional trust in these relationships. Our results indicate that decision tree simplicity positively affects fairness perceptions, mediated by causability. In contrast, prediction accuracy neither directly nor indirectly influences these perceptions. Even if the hypothesized effects of interest are either minor or non-existent, results show that the medium positive effect of causability on the distributive fairness assessment depends on institutional trust. These findings substantially impact the crafting of transparent machine learning models in educational settings. We discuss important implications for fairness and transparency in implementing academic performance prediction systems.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has proven effective in several areas, including computer vision, natural language processing, and disease prediction, which can support clinicians in making decisions along the clinical pathway. However, in order to successfully integrate these algorithms into clinical practice, it is important that their decision-making processes are transparent, explainable, and interpretable. Firstly, this tutorial will introduce targeted eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to address the urgent need for explainability of deep learning in healthcare applications. In particular, it focuses on algorithms for raw biosignals without prior feature extraction that enable medical diagnoses, specifically electrocardiograms (ECG) -- stemming from the heart -- and electroencephalograms (EEG) representing the electrical activity of the brain. Secondly, participants are provided with a comprehensive workflow that includes both data processing and an introduction to relevant network architectures. Subsequently, various XAI methods are described and it is shown, how the resulting relevance attributions can be visualized on biosignals. Finally, two compelling real-world use cases are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of XAI in analyzing ECG and EEG signals for disease prediction and sleep classification, respectively. In summary, the tutorial will provide the skills required for gaining insight into the decision process of deep neural networks processing authentic clinical biosignal data.},

  abstract = {Medical progress notes have recently become available to patients at an unprecedented scale. Progress notes offer patients insight into their care that they cannot find elsewhere. That said, reading a note requires patients to contend with the language, unspoken assumptions, and clutter common to clinical documentation. As the health system reinvents many of its interfaces to incorporate AI assistance, this paper examines what intelligent interfaces could do to help patients read their progress notes. In a qualitative study, we examine the needs of patients as they read a progress note. We then formulate a vision for the explainable note, an augmented progress note that provides support for directing attention, phrase-level understanding, and tracing lines of reasoning. This vision manifests in a set of patient-inspired opportunities for advancing intelligent interfaces for writing and reading progress notes.},

  abstract = {Legal document retrieval and judgment prediction are crucial tasks in intelligent legal systems. In practice, determining whether two documents share the same judgments is essential for establishing their relevance in legal retrieval. However, existing legal retrieval studies either ignore the vital role of judgment prediction or rely on implicit training objectives, expecting a proper alignment of legal documents in vector space based on their judgments. Neither approach provides explicit evidence of judgment consistency for relevance modeling, leading to inaccuracies and a lack of transparency in retrieval. To address this issue, we propose a law-guided method, namely GEAR, within the generative retrieval framework. GEAR explicitly integrates judgment prediction with legal document retrieval in a sequence-to-sequence manner. Specifically, given the intricate nature of legal documents, we first extract rationales from documents based on the definition of charges in law. We then employ these rationales as queries, ensuring efficiency and producing a shared, informative document representation for both tasks. Second, in accordance with the inherent hierarchy of law, we construct a law structure constraint tree and represent each candidate document as a hierarchical semantic ID based on this tree. This empowers GEAR to perform dual predictions for judgment and relevant documents in a single inference, i.e., traversing the tree from the root through intermediate judgment nodes, to document-specific leaf nodes. Third, we devise the revision loss that jointly minimizes the discrepancy between the IDs of predicted and labeled judgments, as well as retrieved documents, thus improving accuracy and consistency for both tasks. Extensive experiments on two Chinese legal case retrieval datasets show the superiority of GEAR over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive judgment prediction performance. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of GEAR on a French statutory article retrieval dataset, reaffirming its robustness across languages and domains.},

  abstract = {TRE (teaching reflection evaluation) is a continuous process, which helps to improve teaching quality, stimulate students' interest, meet their needs, and support the mission and objectives of educational institutions. Intelligent assessment of teachers' teaching reflection is a method to support and enhance teachers' reflection and self-evaluation by using AI (artificial intelligence) technology. Based on the index system of teaching reflection of university teachers, this paper studies the design of intelligent evaluation system of teaching reflection of university teachers with AI as technical support and Matlab programming. The mathematical model is established by using BPNN (BP neural network) model structure, and the neural network is trained by using expert samples. According to the scores of online students on various evaluation indexes of teachers' classroom teaching, the trained neural network is used for data processing, so as to obtain the final evaluation result. The experimental data show that the training and prediction accuracy of teacher TRE model based on BPNN is completely within the acceptable range, which is a reasonable and feasible prediction model and can objectively and fairly evaluate teachers' teaching reflection.},

  abstract = {In the digital economy data processing, traditional data processing methods face the challenge of relying on manual intervention and the risk of data leakage. Data is threatened during transmission and storage, which can lead to the leakage of sensitive information, while manual operations can lead to errors and low efficiency. In contrast, the LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) algorithm based on artificial intelligence can effectively capture and process long-term dependencies in sequential data, and can automatically learn and adapt to patterns on different time scales, thus promoting the development of a series of data processing methods. Through relevant research on the development background and data processing needs of the current digital economy, and with the application of LSTM in digital economy data processing, combined with specific instructions on processing and predicting time series data, natural language processing, and user behavior analysis, this paper designed a digital economy data processing system. Through two sets of simulation experiments, the following conclusion was drawn: selecting six different types of dataset samples, the accuracy evaluation index of the digital economy data processing optimization system improved by an average of about 9.8\%, while the processing speed evaluation index improved by an average of 17.85\%. This indicated that the digital economic data processing system based on LSTM has good application effects.},

Yet we know little about the designers’ perceptions and practices of collaborating with generative AI as a co-creative agent within the context of multi-stakeholder participation. To investigate these questions, we took the domain of avatar design as an example and conducted a qualitative interview study with 21 expert avatar designers who have got different levels of experience and expertise in utilizing generative AI tools in their design workflow. We found that designers not only would fall in a dilemma when deciding whether to consider AI as a co-creative agent according to different stakeholders’ interests, but they also face many challenges in effectively co-creating with the current systems, including challenges in consistently adjusting AI outputs and getting design inspiration within the iterative generation process, etc. Based on our findings, we concluded both the epistemological and creative patterns of collaborating with generative AI and highlighted several design opportunities from both technical and ethical perspectives to better support future designer-AI co-creation.},

Drawing on a previous analysis of opportunities to support care in later life through an ecological carescape framework, workshops captured precarious visions, generational perspectives, and potential ways of reconfiguring care futures.

  abstract = {The continuous advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) enable designers to efficiently obtain vast amounts of inspirational materials during the design conception phase. Various modalities of stimuli can impact designers’ creativity. However, the relationship between the sequence of different modalities (Text, Images, and Virtual Models) and creativity remains to be explored. In this study, we investigate the effects of 6 sequential combinations of 3 modalities on designers’ creativity. Designers (N=36) used the creative stimulation platform InspireMe, accessing inspirational stimuli in various sequences to execute their design tasks. We analyzed the impact on creativity through assessments of work innovation and user interviews. The findings indicate that the sequence of material combinations significantly influences designers’ creativity, with varying impacts on the different sub-attributes of creativity. Drawing on experimental findings and qualitative research, this paper introduces a creativity demand-matching inspirational stimulation interaction strategy—the CDI strategy—that assists designers in developing more targeted design solutions. Furthermore, we propose the 3C Framework, a design strategy for creativity stimulation platforms aimed at designers in the intelligent era. This framework aims to guide the development of creative stimulation platforms for designers in the intelligent era.},

  abstract = {Although various methods have been proposed to improve the robustness of deep neural network models, evaluating these models in a fair and reasonable manner remains a challenge. Existing evaluation methods often consider only limited types of attacks, ignoring the generalization performance against new types of attacks, and fail to cover the most advanced defense models. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework to evaluate model robustness under different types of attacks. This framework integrates non-Lp and Lp attacks, and comprehensively evaluates the robustness of various advanced robust models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet subsets. Experimental results show that even the most advanced defense models exhibit vulnerabilities under certain new types of attacks, highlighting the importance of developing more comprehensive robustness benchmarks and providing guidance for the design of future robust deep learning models.},

  abstract = {Music-based reminiscence has the potential to positively impact the psychological well-being of older adults. However, the aging process and physiological changes, such as memory decline and limited verbal communication, may impede the ability of older adults to recall their memories and life experiences. Given the advanced capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as generated conversations and images, and their potential to facilitate the reminiscing process, this study aims to explore the design of generative AI to support music-based reminiscence in older adults. This study follows a user-centered design approach incorporating various stages, including detailed interviews with two social workers and two design workshops (involving ten older adults). Our work contributes to an in-depth understanding of older adults’ attitudes toward utilizing generative AI for supporting music-based reminiscence and identifies concrete design considerations for the future design of generative AI to enhance the reminiscence experience of older adults.},

While existing research has explored the integration of AIGC tools in daily workflow, little is known about their impact on social dynamics within UX collaboration. We conducted four focus groups and eight semi-structured interviews with 26 UX practitioners to investigate how AIGC tools influence social dynamics in UX collaboration. Our findings indicated that AIGC tools not only mitigated conflicts but also introduced potential new conflicts. AIGC tools expanded the roles of UX practitioners and fostered a team culture characterized by exploring and discussing. Participants have higher expectations for AI-assisted design in user understanding and prototype evaluation, and team-motivated AI tools learning. Based on these findings, we discussed the benefits and concerns of conflict resolution through AIGC and the importance of teams in AI learning. Finally, we proposed several suggestions for future AI design research.},

We initiated the study by considering the traditional AT-making processes performed by OTs and prototyped a web interface that incorporates generative AI to support these processes. Through a series of user studies, we collected OTs' preliminary insights on how generative AI could bridge the gap between clinical reasoning and technical design, potentially streamlining the AT creation and adaptation process while maintaining the crucial element of personalized AT solutions. The study's findings highlight several key benefits of generative AI in OT practice: 1) customization of AT solutions tailored to individual client needs, 2) improved visualization capabilities for client communication, 3) inspiration for new AT design ideas, and 4) potential for rapid prototyping and practice. However, key drawbacks were noted, including limitations in inputting measurements, which can lead to inaccurate outputs and necessitate substantial modifications to the created AT, along with challenges associated with the current state of generative AI.},

  abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays a pivotal role in enhancing adaptive learning systems by fostering an environment where transparency is key to developing students' critical thinking skills. In such systems, each learner's experience is uniquely tailored, not just to their current knowledge and cognitive abilities, but also with the intent of expanding their reasoning and problem-solving capacities. The crux of XAI within these educational contexts lies in its ability to demystify AI decisions. This transparency allows learners to grasp the "why" and "how" of the AI-driven guidance they receive, thereby promoting a deeper level of self-reflection and metacognitive awareness. The integration of XAI into platforms like RiPPLE exemplifies this approach, where the system leverages crowdsourced data and learning science to offer personalized activity recommendations. By aligning these recommendations with individual knowledge states, and elucidating the underlying logic, XAI-equipped adaptive learning environments not only cater to the immediate educational needs but also lay the groundwork for cultivating autonomous and discerning thinkers.},

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) may reshape how participatory design is conducted. To explore the emerging implications of supporting stakeholders with AI, we conducted a systematic review (n = 14) of empirical studies. The literature suggests that AI can improve the accessibility and quality of participatory design by lowering the participatory threshold, and facilitating process execution, collaboration, and creation. Stakeholders’ use of AI also poses risks of relying on biased models, causing cognitive overload, and leading stakeholders to uncritically fixate on AI input, potentially diminishing the quality of design outcomes. Based on these findings, we explore the evolving role of AI in participatory design—and call for future research on its fallibility, participatory nature, and potential for exacerbating stakeholder vulnerabilities. Herewith, this review contributes to our understanding of how AI can support stakeholders in participatory design.},

  abstract = {The Air Quality Index (AQI) is an effective measure of air quality, and accurate prediction of the AQI is important for air pollution control and the daily travel of people. Air pollutants have strong spatio-temporal correlation, and the current air quality prediction methods often fail to adequately extract the spatio-temporal features in the data, which can cause prediction accuracy problems. This paper proposed a Self-Tuning Spatio-Temporal Residual Network (AAM-AST2RN) fusing adaptive adjacency matrix and attention mechanism for enhanced air quality prediction. AAM-AST2RN utilized a parallel network structure, which was capable of fully extracting and fusing spatio-temporal features and automatically adjusting the network hyperparameters. In addition, the AAM-AST2RN model constructed the AAM generation module, residual connection and Improved Channel Attention mechanism (ICA), the AAM generation module avoided the adverse effect of static adjacency matrix on the model feature extraction, the residual connection and ICA effectively alleviated the node feature over-smoothing problem caused by Graph Convolutional neural Network (GCN) in the model and improved the node feature differentiation. In order to validate the model effect, the model was utilized to predict the AQI of 12 air monitoring sites in Beijing, and compared with the prediction effect of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory neural network (ConvLSTM), combined Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory neural network (CNN-LSTM), and GCN-LSTM. Compared with the above three spatio-temporal prediction models, the coefficient of determination (R2) of the AAM-AST2RN model was improved by 11.30\%, 1.95\%, and 1.54\%, respectively, and the prediction error was lower. The AAM-AST2RN air quality prediction model proposed in this paper can fully extract the spatio-temporal features in the data and has a good prediction performance for air quality.},

To address this complexity, we introduce FactoryDecoder, a development tool for non-expert users in 3D engineering to generate and modify digital twins using natural language inputs. FactoryDecoder converts users' descriptions of production line into hierarchical asset codes, facilitating the automated layout and simplified modification of digital twins. Furthermore, if the system finds that the 3D asset library lacks appropriate device representations, it will automatically use a 3D mesh generator to create new ones. We evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) to optimize FactoryDecoder's capabilities. Preliminary user studies highlight FactoryDecoder's effectiveness.},

  abstract = {In order to solve the problem of low segmentation accuracy due to the interference of noise information such as light and shadow in the current lightweight blind segmentation model, we propose a fast tactile paving segmentation model based on reparameterize. The multi-branch training structure learns spatial features such as tactile paving, light and shadow while compensating for the loss of information in the feature map due to downsampling operations as well as enhancing the learning of its features in the channel dimension. The single-branch structure obtained after reparameterization of the multibranch structure ensures faster inference of the model as well as lower memory access costs. The introduction of coordinate attention allows the model to learn the distribution law of the features of tactile paving, light and shadow, etc. in the spatial dimension and automatically generate the attention map with weight information, effectively reducing the weight of the spatial structural features of noise such as light and shadow. Experiments show that the model's ability to resist interference from environmental noise such as light and shadow has been enhanced and the segmentation accuracy has been further improved under the premise of ensuring the inference speed.},

In prior literature, filter (e.g., backward elimination) and embedded (e.g., LASSO) methods have hyperparameters (e.g., top-k, score thresholding) and tie to specific models, thus, hard to generalize; wrapper methods search a feature subset in a huge discrete space and is computationally costly. To transform the way of feature selection, we regard a selected feature subset as a selection decision token sequence and reformulate feature selection as a deep sequential generative learning task that distills feature knowledge and generates decision sequences. Our method includes three steps: (1) We develop a deep variational transformer model over a joint of sequential reconstruction, variational, and performance evaluator losses. Our model can distill feature selection knowledge and learn a continuous embedding space to map feature selection decision sequences into embedding vectors associated with utility scores. (2) We leverage the trained feature subset utility evaluator as a gradient provider to guide the identification of the optimal feature subset embedding; (3) We decode the optimal feature subset embedding to autoregressively generate the best feature selection decision sequence with autostop. Extensive experimental results show this generative perspective is effective and generic, without large discrete search space and expert-specific hyperparameters. The code is available at .},

  abstract = {Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have shown incredible promise for zero shot image-to-image translation and editing. Most of these approaches work by combining or replacing network-specific features used in the generation of new images with those taken from the inversion of some guide image. Methods of this type are considered the current state-of-the-art in training-free approaches, but have some notable limitations: they tend to be costly in runtime and memory, and often depend on deterministic sampling that limits variation in generated results. We propose Filter-Guided Diffusion (FGD), an alternative approach that leverages fast filtering operations during the diffusion process to support finer control over the strength and frequencies of guidance and can work with non-deterministic samplers to produce greater variety. With its efficiency, FGD can be sampled over multiple seeds and hyperparameters in less time than a single run of other SOTA methods to produce superior results based on structural and semantic metrics. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments to evaluate the performance of FGD in translation tasks and also demonstrate its potential in localized editing when used with masks.},

  abstract = {Attack-defense trees, an extension of attack trees, are extensively used by security engineers to document potential countermeasures for security threats present in a system's design. These trees help integrate initial system models with countermeasures, allowing for early testing of their efficiency and impact in the design cycle. Despite advancements in automating attack tree construction, selecting the initial set of countermeasures for conversion into an attack-defense tree remains largely manual. This paper proposes an approach and a tool that extends the TTool-AI attack tree generation feature by leveraging large language models and natural language processing to create a set of countermeasures and generate attack-defense trees based on an input attack tree. To evaluate our contribution, our approach is tested using attack-defense trees generated from attack trees, each representing possible threats to an associated system specification. In addition, we introduce metrics to assess the semantic correctness and completeness of the generated attack-defense trees. We compared, using our metrics, the attack-defense trees created from our methodology to those created by an engineer and found that attack-defense trees created using AI and secondary mitigation data provided better trees than solely using AI. We also discovered that this approach generated trees that were comparable to the quality of attack-defense trees generated from a security engineer at the associate level. From these results, we believe that our contribution could aid engineers in identifying not only appropriate countermeasures for attack trees but also the optimal number of countermeasures, avoiding the complexity of redundant mitigations. Furthermore, our approach complements standard modeling practices, particularly during the initial design phase, reducing the need for time-consuming re-engineering throughout the system's lifecycle.},

  abstract = {Voting advice applications (VAAs) are pivotal web-based tools that guide citizens to align with political parties and candidates that match their preferences. Traditional methods for creating candidate profiles predominantly rely on questionnaire responses, a time-intensive and costly process. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-centric methodology utilizing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), culminating in creating political avatars. These political avatars are engineered using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 and Bard. They are adept at processing and interpreting data primarily sourced from Twitter and leveraging bespoke, self-trained datasets. Integrating advanced AI technology with diverse data sources equips political avatars with unprecedented analytical and predictive capabilities, setting a new standard in political analysis. Unlike traditional methods, political avatars are adept at emulating the responses of real politicians or experts, showcasing a remarkable capacity to interact with VAA surveys. This novel approach presents the potential to either compete with or enhance the insights traditionally obtained from human experts. Another critical aspect of our study is comparing political avatars and previous research employing question-answering (QA) models based on advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for political profiling. This comparative analysis reveals that Political Avatars offer a significantly more robust solution for profile construction. While QA models provide structured responses based on specific queries, political avatars bring an element of dynamism and depth, capable of generating nuanced, context-aware responses. This shift from static, questionnaire-based profiling to dynamic, AI-driven avatars marks a substantial leap in political analysis. Generative AI in crafting Political Avatars introduces a transformative element to data analysis. This approach facilitates a layered and more sophisticated interpretation of political stances, moving beyond the limitations of traditional profiling methods. By employing political avatars, our methodology not only streamlines the profiling process but also enriches the quality of insights derived, paving the way for a more nuanced understanding of the political landscape.},

This paper explores the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in technology sovereignty, its contributions, and benefits for the government, associated risks, and challenges, and how it influences government policies. It begins with examining GAI's capabilities to comprehend how it understands natural language, trains on existing data, and generates realistic outputs, followed by a discussion of its potential benefits for governments that enable them to act independently and autonomously in diverse sectors. It highlights how it can empower them to administer technological ecosystems, promote domestic innovation, and facilitate policy-making processes. However, contrary to its benefits, GAI is also capable of inflicting negative consequences on society. Therefore, the paper also addresses the risks and challenges associated with GAI that necessitate reflection on existing policies and developing new ones that align with a nation's legal frameworks. Exploring the influence of GAI on government policies, the paper highlights the significance of collaboration in policy-making endeavors to ensure ethical future developments and bring value to public interest and democratic values. This comprehensive analysis aims to shed light on the responsible and ethical use of GAI to preserve human rights, promote economic growth, sustain social justice, and inform the responsible use of GAI within the framework of technology sovereignty.},

  abstract = {Generative information retrieval (Gen-IR) is a fast-growing interdisciplinary research area that investigates how to leverage advances in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve information retrieval systems. Gen-IR has attracted interest from the information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning communities, among others. Since the dawn of Gen-IR last year, there has been an explosion of Gen-IR systems that have launched and are now widely used. Interest in this area across academia and industry is only expected to continue to grow as new research challenges and application opportunities arise. The goal of this proposed workshop, The Second Workshop on Generative Information Retrieval (Gen-IR @ SIGIR 2024) is to provide an interactive venue for exploring a broad range of foundational and applied Gen-IR research. The workshop will focus on tasks such as generative document retrieval, grounded answer generation, generative recommendation, and generative knowledge graphs, all through the lens of model training, model behavior, and broader issues. The workshop will be highly interactive, favoring panel discussions, poster sessions, and roundtable discussions over one-sided keynotes and paper talks.},

  abstract = {This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI), and - among other approaches - particularly to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. Following successful workshops in 2022 and 2023, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a pilot study that explores the application of active learning, traditionally studied in the context of discriminative models, to generative models. We specifically focus on image synthesis personalization tasks. The primary challenge in conducting active learning on generative models lies in the open-ended nature of querying, which differs from the closed form of querying in discriminative models that typically target a single concept. We introduce the concept of anchor directions to transform the querying process into a semi-open problem. We propose a direction-based uncertainty sampling strategy to enable generative active learning and tackle the exploitation-exploration dilemma. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that an open-source model can achieve superior performance compared to closed-source models developed by large companies, such as Google's StyleDrop.

Given the widespread use of this tool and the lack of knowledge over how it can support learning, there is a need for educators to have a framework for using it in the classroom and teaching their students usage strategies that are beneficial for learning. One pathway forward is through creativity, a process crucial for learning and also connected to the act of using gen-AI. This poster demonstrates the results of a study designed to provide an in-depth view on how creativity intersects with gen-AI usage in a computational physics course. In the course, students learn about computing tools during group-based, open-ended computational physics activities. Students are often tasked with using gen-AI to explore and help make decisions. The findings demonstrate a connection between using gen-AI and engaging in creative processes, and the implications point to strategies for supporting student usage of gen-AI.},

It is exciting that this year, we have invited speakers from both industry (e.g., Amazon, Zhipu AI) and academia (e.g., USC, UCLA). The topics cover various perspectives of generative AI including foundation models, streaming LLMs, LLM training and inference. As demonstrated, data plays a crucial role in developing cutting-edge generative AI models. For example, the Gemini Team has found that "data quality is an important factor for highly-performing models...''. To date, there is still significant room to define design principles and develop methods for improved data collection, selection, and synthetic data generation for the pre-training and alignment of language, vision, and multi-modal models. Therefore, the Day will invite the speakers and KDD audience to discuss the challenges and opportunities for data mining researchers in the era of generative AI.},

The purpose of this research is to investigate social norms, expectations, and standards of the elderly population for improving trust relationships while interacting with generative AI. The study is based on the CASA paradigm to gain a better understanding of the trust dynamics in human-computer communication to improve the adoption of GAI for elders' health and well-being. We validated the conceptual model with empirical data from 287 elderly users collected through an online and offline survey tool. Quantitative responses received were analysed using structural equation modeling. The study highlights how multimodal interaction, empathy, personalization, augmentation, bias stereotyping, and privacy and security affect the extent to which elderly consumers perceive GAI as trustworthy. Findings indicate that multimodal interaction, personalization, augmentation, and bias stereotyping significantly influenced the trust relationship between the elderly population and GAI. However, empathy privacy, and security were found to be insignificant in trust relationships. Further trust relationships significantly impacted GAI usage. The research provides strong theoretical and practical implications as all the stakeholders like healthcare professionals, patients/users, caregivers, and technology developers can be involved in building applications that cater to diverse needs and promote positive social interactions that can enhance GAI trust and usage.},

  abstract = {Video streaming stands as the cornerstone of telecommunication networks, constituting over 60\% of mobile data traffic as of June 2023. The paramount challenge faced by video streaming service providers is ensuring high Quality of Experience (QoE) for users. In HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS), including DASH and HLS, video content is encoded at multiple quality versions, with an Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithm dynamically selecting versions based on network conditions. Concurrently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the industry, particularly in content recommendation and personalization. Leveraging user data and advanced algorithms, AI enhances user engagement, satisfaction, and video quality through super-resolution and denoising techniques.However, challenges persist, such as real-time processing on resource-constrained devices, the need for diverse training datasets, privacy concerns, and model interpretability. Despite these hurdles, the promise of Generative Artificial Intelligence emerges as a transformative force. Generative AI, capable of synthesizing new data based on learned patterns, holds vast potential in the video streaming landscape. In the context of video streaming, it can create realistic and immersive content, adapt in real time to individual preferences, and optimize video compression for seamless streaming in low-bandwidth conditions.This research proposal outlines a comprehensive exploration at the intersection of advanced AI algorithms and digital entertainment, focusing on the potential of generative AI to elevate video quality, user interactivity, and the overall streaming experience. The objective is to integrate generative models into video streaming pipelines, unraveling novel avenues that promise a future of dynamic, personalized, and visually captivating streaming experiences for viewers.},

  abstract = {Self-adaptive systems (SASs) are designed to handle changes and uncertainties through a feedback loop with four core functionalities: monitoring, analyzing, planning, and execution. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this article aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI’s within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies.†},

While some oppose their use, many researchers have begun to approach the topic of educational AI use from a different perspective. Despite being in its early stages; this field of research has produced notable insights into the capabilities and limitations of models like ChatGPT. This paper utilizes a SWOT analysis framework to analyze and consolidate existing literature, with a specific focus on Computer Science education. Through the analysis of this literature, we have created a set of use cases and guidelines to aid in the future development of strategies and tools within this field. Our findings indicate that while some concerns are valid, such as AI's ability to generate plagiarized work, we identified several promising avenues and opportunities for careful integration of this technology into education.},

  abstract = {Technological intervention to support care areas that some people may not have access to is of paramount importance to promote sustainable development of good health and wellbeing. This study aims to explore the linguistic similarities and differences between human professionals and Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) conversational agents in therapeutic dialogues. Initially, the MISTRAL-7B Large Language Model (LLM) is instructed to generate responses to patient queries to form a synthetic equivalent to a publicly available psychology dataset. A large set of linguistic features (e.g., text metrics, lexical diversity and richness, readability scores, sentiment, emotions, and named entities) is extracted and studied from both the expert and synthetically-generated text. The results suggest a significantly richer vocabulary in humans than the LLM approach. Similarly, the use of sentiment was significantly different between the two, suggesting a difference in the supportive or objective language used and that synthetic linguistic expressions of emotion may differ from those expressed by an intelligent being. However, no statistical significance was observed between human professionals and AI in the use of function words, pronouns and several named entities; possibly reflecting an increased proficiency of LLMs in modelling some language patterns, even in a specialised context (i.e., therapy). However, current findings do not support the similarity in sentimental nuance and emotional expression, which limits the effectiveness of contemporary LLMs as standalone agents. Further development is needed towards clinically validated algorithms.},

While prior research has examined GenAI from a techno-centric perspective, there is still a lack of understanding about how users perceive and utilize GenAI in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with (N = 18) GenAI users in creative industries, investigating the human-GenAI co-creation process within a holistic LUA (Learning, Using and Assessing) framework. Our study uncovered an intriguingly complex landscape: Prospects – GenAI greatly fosters the co-creation between human expertise and GenAI capabilities, profoundly transforming creative workflows; Challenges – Meanwhile, users face substantial uncertainties and complexities arising from resource availability, tool usability, and regulatory compliance; Strategies – In response, users actively devise various strategies to overcome many of such challenges. Our study reveals key implications for the design of future GenAI tools.},

UX practitioners typically use GenAI individually, favoring writing-based tasks, but note limitations for design-focused activities, like wireframing and prototyping; 3) UX practitioners call for better training on GenAI to enhance their abilities to generate effective prompts and evaluate output quality.

This study explores the congruence between online course descriptions and actual course syllabi to improve course preparation and consistency for instructors. Alignment between course catalog descriptions and actual course content as detailed in the syllabus can lead to learning improvements, student satisfaction, and academic alignment in a program. Our research introduces a novel framework utilizing GAI to systematically evaluates and identifies mismatches and suggests content to close the gap between online course descriptions and syllabus content. We used OpenAI’s ChatGPT to extract key topics from course syllabi and assessed the congruence between results and course description content with embedding methods such as BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT, coupled with cosine similarity metrics. Our framework also integrates an outlier detection algorithm to identify courses with significant misalignments and use GAI applications to refine and enhance course catalog descriptions. This approach helps higher education institutions update course offerings with cutting-edge technology and contributes to curriculum development, helping improve student learning efficiency and course design.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), exemplified by ChatGPT, Midjourney, and other state-of-the-art large language models and diffusion models, holds significant potential for transforming education and enhancing human productivity. While the prevalence of GenAI in education has motivated numerous research initiatives, integrating these technologies within the learning analytics (LA) cycle and their implications for practical interventions remain underexplored. This paper delves into the prospective opportunities and challenges GenAI poses for advancing LA. We present a concise overview of the current GenAI landscape and contextualise its potential roles within Clow’s generic framework of the LA cycle. We posit that GenAI can play pivotal roles in analysing unstructured data, generating synthetic learner data, enriching multimodal learner interactions, advancing interactive and explanatory analytics, and facilitating personalisation and adaptive interventions. As the lines blur between learners and GenAI tools, a renewed understanding of learners is needed. Future research can delve deep into frameworks and methodologies that advocate for human-AI collaboration. The LA community can play a pivotal role in capturing data about human and AI contributions and exploring how they can collaborate most effectively. As LA advances, it is essential to consider the pedagogical implications and broader socioeconomic impact of GenAI for ensuring an inclusive future.},

  abstract = {We introduce a high-fidelity portrait shadow removal model that can effectively enhance the image of a portrait by predicting its appearance under disturbing shadows and highlights. Portrait shadow removal is a highly ill-posed problem where multiple plausible solutions can be found based on a single image. For example, disentangling complex environmental lighting from original skin color is a non-trivial problem. While existing works have solved this problem by predicting the appearance residuals that can propagate local shadow distribution, such methods are often incomplete and lead to unnatural predictions, especially for portraits with hard shadows. We overcome the limitations of existing local propagation methods by formulating the removal problem as a generation task where a diffusion model learns to globally rebuild the human appearance from scratch as a condition of an input portrait image. For robust and natural shadow removal, we propose to train the diffusion model with a compositional repurposing framework: a pre-trained text-guided image generation model is first fine-tuned to harmonize the lighting and color of the foreground with a background scene by using a background harmonization dataset; and then the model is further fine-tuned to generate a shadow-free portrait image via a shadow-paired dataset. To overcome the limitation of losing fine details in the latent diffusion model, we propose a guided-upsampling network to restore the original high-frequency details (e.g., wrinkles and dots) from the input image. To enable our compositional training framework, we construct a high-fidelity and large-scale dataset using a lightstage capturing system and synthetic graphics simulation. Our generative framework effectively removes shadows caused by both self and external occlusions while maintaining original lighting distribution and high-frequency details. Our method also demonstrates robustness to diverse subjects captured in real environments.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have blurred the boundary of high-quality text generation between humans and machines, which is favorable for generative text steganography. Currently, advanced steganographic mapping is not suitable for LLMs since most users are restricted to accessing only the black-box API or user interface of the LLMs, thereby lacking access to the training vocabulary and its sampling probabilities. In this paper, we explore a black-box generative text steganographic method based on the user interfaces of large language models, which is called LLM-Stega. The main goal of LLM-Stega is to ensure secure covert communication between Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver) by using the user interfaces of LLMs. Specifically, We first construct a keyword set and design a new encrypted steganographic mapping to embed secret messages. Furthermore, an optimization mechanism based on reject sampling is proposed to guarantee accurate extraction of secret messages and rich semantics of generated stego texts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LLM-Stega outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {The global ultra-wide display market is growing rapidly due to widespread consumer adoption. However, existing content, especially on TV screens, is mainly designed for lower aspect ratios like 4:3. As TVs shift towards wider formats, there’s a need to develop a method to transform legacy content and adapt to varying screen sizes. This shift holds the potential to revolutionize the content viewing experience for gamers, content creators, and streaming enthusiasts. While delivering high-quality visual content for dynamic aspect ratios remains a challenge, recent advancements in Deep Learning show promise in addressing these problems with generative approaches. Our contribution begins with a survey of prior video completion efforts, providing a foundational backdrop. We then introduce our novel solution, combining optical flow methodologies with generative latent diffusion models. These models, conditioned on an initial prompt and evolving video frame, refine content generation. We validate our approach on the DAVIS dataset, demonstrating its efficacy and robustness. In summary, our study pioneers advancements in content generation for ultra-wide displays.},

  abstract = {The advent of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new paradigm of search engines that use generative models to gather and summarize information to answer user queries. This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},

  abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence technology, the application of artificial intelligence in drug design has received increasing attention from researchers. The process of new drug development is characterized by high costs, time-consuming and labor-intensive, and low success rate. The application of artificial intelligence technology in drug design can reduce the uncertainty in the drug development process, especially in target identification, small molecule drug screening, and drug property prediction, thereby shortening the research and development cycle of new drugs and improving research and development efficiency. In this study, 772 articles collected from the database from 2003 to 2022 were selected as the research objects, aiming to explore the bibliometric indicators of the application of artificial intelligence in drug discovery, such as countries/regions, institutions, authors, journals, categories, references, and co-authorship, co-occurrence, and co-citation of keywords. The study aims to investigate the research progress and prospects of artificial intelligence technology in the field of drug design through bibliometric methods. The results show that in the field of artificial intelligence-assisted drug design, the most influential scientist globally is "Schneider, Gisbert" from Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, the most influential research institution is University of Pittsburgh, and the most influential country is the USA. Artificial intelligence-assisted drug design mainly focuses on four aspects: small molecule drug screening, peptide drug development, protein crystal structure prediction, and candidate drug formulation optimization. In the future, artificial intelligence will play a more important role in accelerating drug design processes, personalized drug therapy, and optimization of drug combination therapy.},

To tackle this challenge, we propose a research agenda in Brazil that encompasses short, medium, and long-term actions aimed at fostering AI development that is socially conscious and critical. We conclude by emphasizing the need to promote a profound understanding of AI’s effects on society through an integrated and multifaceted approach, aligned with human values. We invite the entire HCI community to collaborate in this effort, seeking to research and develop AI interfaces that enrich human interactions in an ethical and inclusive manner.

Traditional machine learning methods have achieved certain results in solving this problem, but generally ignore the continuous characteristics of malicious network behavior in time series. Aiming at this weakness, this paper proposes a Gated Unit Convolutional Networks (GUCN) model based on gated recurrent unit and convolutional neural network. Meanwhile, it also uses the feature screening method of random forest and the data dimension reduction method of UMAP to process the high dimensional data, which reduces the data redundancy. The results show that the method can effectively detect malicious network behavior, and because it can learn the objective characteristics of behavior in time series, it has the potential to identify malicious attack behavior in advance.},

Nielsen recently argued that we have entered a new era of human-computer interaction in which users need only specify what they want and not how it should be produced&nbsp;[1]. This paradigm of intent-based outcome specification shifts control over from people to AI, enabling new forms of co-creativity and co-creation. Although these systems are capable of holding fluent conversations and producing high-fidelity images, difficulties remain regarding their ability to produce outputs that satisfy their users’ needs. Our workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from both the HCI and AI disciplines to explore the implications of this shift in control, deepen our understanding of the human-AI co-creative process, and examine how we can design, build, use, and evaluate human-AI co-creative systems that are both effective and safe.},

  abstract = {The process of fashion design usually involves sketching, refining, and coloring, with designers drawing inspiration from various images to fuel their creative endeavors. However, conventional image search methods often yield irrelevant results, impeding the design process. Moreover, creating and coloring sketches can be time-consuming and demanding, acting as a bottleneck in the design workflow. In this work, we introduce HAIGEN (Human-AI Collaboration for GENeration), an efficient fashion design system for Human-AI collaboration developed to aid designers. Specifically, HAIGEN consists of four modules. T2IM, located in the cloud, generates reference inspiration images directly from text prompts. With three other modules situated locally, the I2SM batch generates the image material library into a certain designer-style sketch material library. The SRM recommends similar sketches in the generated library to designers for further refinement, and the STM colors the refined sketch according to the styles of inspiration images. Through our system, any designer can perform local personalized fine-tuning and leverage the powerful generation capabilities of large models in the cloud, streamlining the entire design development process. Given that our approach integrates both cloud and local model deployment schemes, it effectively safeguards design privacy by avoiding the need to upload personalized data from local designers. We validated the effectiveness of each module through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments. User surveys also confirmed that HAIGEN offers significant advantages in design efficiency, positioning it as a new generation of aid-tool for designers.},

  abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) has seen great advancements in the past two years and the conversation around adoption is increasing. Widely available GenAI tools are disrupting classroom practices as they can write and explain code with minimal student prompting. While most acknowledge that there is no way to stop students from using such tools, a consensus has yet to form on how students should use them if they choose to do so. At the same time, researchers have begun to introduce new pedagogical tools that integrate GenAI into computing curricula. These new tools offer students personalized help or attempt to teach prompting skills without undercutting code comprehension. This working group aims to detail the current landscape of education-focused GenAI tools and teaching approaches, present gaps where new tools or approaches could appear, identify good practice-examples, and provide a guide for instructors to utilize GenAI as they continue to adapt to this new era.},

To frame this argument, they draw on two theories of generative failure: failing forward, which uses failures to iterate on designs to meet existing criteria, and failing sideways, which reconsiders the criteria for success. Using a fail-forward perspective, the authors describe how they might revise their research methods for data preparation, process documentation, and task delegation to create more reliable results. Then, using a fail-sideways perspective, they reexamine criteria for publishable results to reimagine the study more fundamentally.},

However, existing works focused on conventional machine-learning and pattern-based AI systems, and little is known about how researchers interact with GenAI in qualitative research. This work delves into researchers’ perceptions of their collaboration with GenAI, specifically ChatGPT. Through a user study involving ten qualitative researchers, we found ChatGPT to be a valuable collaborator for thematic analysis, enhancing coding efficiency, aiding initial data exploration, offering granular quantitative insights, and assisting comprehension for non-native speakers and non-experts. Yet, concerns about its trustworthiness and accuracy, reliability and consistency, limited contextual understanding, and broader acceptance within the research community persist. We contribute five actionable design recommendations to foster effective human-AI collaboration. These include incorporating transparent explanatory mechanisms, enhancing interface and integration capabilities, prioritising contextual understanding and customisation, embedding human-AI feedback loops and iterative functionality, and strengthening trust through validation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {When working with generative artificial intelligence (AI), users may see productivity gains, but content generated with the help of AI may not match their preferences exactly. The boost in productivity may come at the expense of users' idiosyncrasies, such as personal style and tastes, preferences we would naturally express without AI. To let users express their preferences, many AI systems let users edit their prompt (e.g., Midjourney) or allow more natural interactions (e.g., ChatGPT), and users can always review and edit the AI-generated output themselves. However, aligning a user's intentions with an AI's output can take time and may not always be worth it if the AI's first or default output "does the job." In short, users face a trade-off between AI output fidelity and communication cost. The purpose of this work is to examine the impact of this human-AI interaction on the AI-generated content we produce as a society.We propose a Bayesian model to study the societal consequences of human-AI interactions. For a given task, rational users can exchange information with the AI to align its output with their heterogeneous preferences. The AI has a knowledge of the distribution of preferences in the population and uses a Bayesian update to create the optimal output with maximal expected fidelity given the information shared by the user. Users choose the amount of information they share to maximize their utility, balancing the cost of communication with the fidelity of the output.We show that the interplay between individual users and AI may lead to societal challenges. Outputs may become more homogenized. The AI-generated output distribution has a lower variance than the users' preference distribution. And this phenomenon is exacerbated when AI-generated content is used to train the next generation of AI: we show numerically that the users' rational decisions and the AI's training process can mutually reinforce each other, leading to a homogenization "death spiral." We also study the effects of AI bias, identifying who benefits or loses when using an AI model that does not accurately reflect the population preference distribution. At the population level, the censoring type of bias (e.g., biasing against the more unique preferences) negatively impacts the population utility as a whole, especially users with uncommon preferences who rely on AI interactivity the most. On the other hand, directional biases (e.g., a slightly left-leaning AI) will influence the users' chosen output, leading to a societal bias. Nonetheless, our research also demonstrates that creating models that facilitate human-AI interactions can limit these risks and preserve the population preference diversity.A full version of this paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10448.},

  abstract = {This comprehensive study investigates the optimization of handover processes in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) utilizing a hybrid approach combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Double-Q Learning (DQL). The research is pivotal for modern telecommunication networks that demand high-speed, efficient, and seamless data transfer, especially for users in motion. The primary objective is to minimize unnecessary handovers and enhance overall network efficiency in transitioning connections among LTE, 5G, and Wi-Fi 6 technologies. The methodology integrates DQL with LSTM to create a robust decision-making framework that dynamically adapts to user movement and network conditions. This hybrid model significantly reduces the probability of service disruptions and data transmission inefficiencies typically encountered in dense network environments. The approach leverages the LSTM's capability to predict optimal handover points based on sequential data analysis and the DQL's effectiveness in refining these predictions to prevent ping-pong effects and radio link failures. In a simulated scenario within a 100x100 meter area, encompassing a 20-story building with 1,000 randomly distributed users (20\% outdoors and 80\% indoors), the network's performance under various conditions, including users moving at speeds of 0-10 km/hr., was meticulously analyzed. The simulation employed advanced machine learning techniques to manage the network's service radii effectively—15 meters for Wi-Fi6, 35 meters for 5G, and 1,500 meters for LTE—ensuring optimal coverage and connectivity. Results from the study indicated a total of 603 handovers, with a notable success rate of 94\%. This outcome highlights the efficacy of integrating LSTM with DQL in reducing unnecessary handovers, enhancing signal strength detection, and improving system throughput. The study demonstrated that this innovative approach could effectively mitigate 36 instances of ping-pong effects and completely manage to avoid critical radio link failures in three instances. This research underscores the transformative potential of applying sophisticated computational models to solve complex problems in network management. By addressing key challenges such as latency, packet loss, and the efficiency of the handover process, the study not only enhances user experience by ensuring continuous service during mobility but also supports bandwidth-intensive applications like live streaming and online gaming. These advancements herald significant improvements in network reliability and performance, paving the way for future innovations in telecommunications.},

  abstract = {The multimodal process of machine translation is studied by focusing on the development of artificial intelligence in language processing and the transformation of vocabulary into numerical representations through vectorization. The neural networks such as CBOW and Skip-gram models are applied to analyze the word vectorization. It also explores the Transformer model with self-attention mechanism, emphasizing the importance of Layer Normalization for training stability and convergence speed. The emergence of ChatGPT as a state-of-the-art conversational AI model, highlights its role in assisting translators with language understanding and generation tasks. The application of generative artificial intelligence is discussed in translation practice, where human-machine interaction maximizes human intelligence while utilizing AI capabilities. DALL·E2 is capable of generating images from text, and the integration of image with translated text plays an important role in constructing the being of the intersemiotic translated work as they maintain the existential emotions effectively through the text-image multimodal interaction.},

  abstract = {This study combines theories from psychology and artificial intelligence algorithms to explore how individuals’ level of involution engagement affects their lying flat behavior. Through a questionnaire survey of 255 participants, it was found that the overall effect of the level of involution engagement on lying flat behavior was not significant. However, learned helplessness played a mediating role, with its effect being moderated by justice perception and sense of gain. Additionally, this study used the artificial intelligence algorithm XGBOOST to further analyze the influence of demographic variables and questionnaire items on individuals’ lying flat behavior. 80\% of the data was used as the training set to build the algorithm model, and the remaining 20\% of the data was used for prediction. The results showed that the predictive accuracy reached 96.08\%. Moreover, XGBOOST can rank the importance of independent variables, allowing for more timely and effective prediction and adjustment of individuals’ lying flat behavior based on important factors.},

  abstract = {Recently, consumer demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications using deep neural network (DNN) model such as large language model (LLM), miXed Reality (XR), and AI assistants has been steadily increasing. Hitherto, on-device AI and offloaded analytics with the help of mobile edge computing (MEC) have been extensively studied to realize AI services on top of mobile devices. However, both technologies suffer from the limited resources of mobile devices, such as thermal resilience, battery capacity, and memory size. To tackle this problem, we first extensively examine the impact of heat and memory constraints of a mobile device when networking and processing resources and multi-dimensional DNN model sizes are dynamically managed for AI applications via motivating measurement. From the experimental results, we conjecture that the threshold-based approach for joint consideration of heat and memory constraints would increase the performance of AI applications in terms of energy, frames per second (FPS), and inference accuracy. Hence, we propose a threshold-based H&amp;M algorithm that jointly adjusts offloading, Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), and DNN model size, aiming to maximize inference accuracy while keeping target FPS with memory and heat constraints in various environments. Finally, we implement the proposed scheme on a mobile device and an MEC server and evaluate its performance and adaptability via extensive experiments.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The research aims to construct an efficient artificial intelligence translation model, proposing an AI translation model based on attention mechanism and adding skip links. This model extracts and fuses text features through attention mechanism, and achieves deep training of the neural network through skip links, making the neural network have better performance. The results showed that the performance of the TMMCJL model was outstanding, with the fastest convergence speed and the best convergence effect. In the experiment of processing 50 to 400 segments of text, the average accuracy of the TMMCJL was 86.5\%, and the F1 score reached 87.5, surpassing the accuracy of the BERT wwm model at 77.9\% and 76.2 F1 scores, as well as the Roberta model at 81.5\% and 85.6 F1 scores. These data clearly demonstrate the significant advantages of the TMMCJL model in terms of accuracy and F1 score. This model not only improves translation quality, but also has potential wide application value due to its stability in model training and practical application, providing a new direction for the future application of deep learning in the field of NLP.},

  abstract = {The accessibility of websites has become imperative in an increasingly connected world. However, many websites remain inaccessible to certain audiences, particularly the visually impaired. One often overlooked aspect is the description of non-textual elements, especially images. This study explores how artificial intelligence can be utilized to enhance image accessibility on websites. Initially, we identified generative models for alternative image text descriptions and explored the last version of ChatGPT-4V. These models were tested on fifty images, and the generated descriptions were evaluated by a web content generation expert. The results of this experiment emphasize the importance of these models in reducing the time required for description generation. However, we observed that the obtained results did not meet the quality requirements for descriptive texts that could render images more accessible. Regarding Chat GPT-4V, the descriptions are of better quality, though its current efficiency is hampered by its slowness.L'accessibilit\'{e} des sites Web est devenue un imp\'{e}ratif dans un monde de plus en plus connect\'{e}.

One possible application set to transform social interactions is the use of generative speech to power AI agents that can realistically represent people. Our work examines the potential implications of AI agents representing individuals in human conversations ("agent representation") as a way to begin filling this research gap. We take a multi-method approach, conducting formative interviews with developers, a co-design workshop with designers, a harm analysis among researchers, and interviews with the general public. Both technologists and potential users worry adopting agent representations might harm the quality, trust, and autonomy of human communication. Potential users are particularly concerned that agent representations could undermine the value of social interaction and threaten individuals’ ability to control their image. To avoid such potential consequences, future genAI-powered agents and speech applications should take into account user-defined red lines when considering applying these technologies in social settings.},

While the West has started to examine the limitations and risks associated with these tools, their impacts on the Global South have remained understudied. Based on our interviews, focus group discussions (FGD), and social media-based qualitative study, this paper reports how popular text-to-image GAI tools (ex., DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Firefly) are affecting various image-related local creative fields. We report how these tools limit the creative explorations of marginal artists, struggle to understand linguistic nuances, fail to generate local forms of art and architecture, and misrepresent the diversity among citizens in the image production process. Drawing from a rich body of work on critical image theory, postcolonial computing, and design politics, we explain how our findings are pertinent to HCI’s broader interest in social justice, decolonization, and global development.},

However, when such navigation aids are unavailable or not appropriately marked up, this situation can cause serious difficulties. This article presents the design and evaluation of a tool for automatically generating navigation aids with headers and internal links for screen readers with topicalisation and labelling algorithms. The proposed tool uses natural language processing techniques to divide a web document into topic segments and label each segment in two cycles based on its content. We conducted an initial user study in the first cycle with eight blind and partially-sighted screen reader users. The evaluation involved tasks with questions answered by participants with information from texts with and without automatically generated headers. The results in the first cycle provided preliminary indicators of performance improvement and cognitive load reduction. The second cycle involved co-designing an improved version with two blind experts in web accessibility, resulting in a browser extension which injects automatically generated headers and in-page navigation with internal links, along with improvements in the generation of labels using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The browser extension was evaluated by seven blind participants using the same four texts used to evaluate the preliminary prototype developed in the first cycle. With the two development cycles, the study provided important insights into the design of navigation aids for screen-reader users using natural language processing techniques, including the potential use of generative artificial intelligence for assistive technologies and limitations that need to be explored in future research.},

For example, generative AI tools may speed the process of developing and iterating on interface prototypes. However, as happens with all technologies when acquiring broader use, these systems are being creatively repurposed.Of interest to the EduCHI community are those unanticipated uses that serve to contribute to user experience design and research in novel, unexpected ways. This position paper provides an overview of existing generative AI tools, their intended purpose, and their unanticipated uses within the design and research process, as evidenced by a brief review of related literature and selected classroom examples. This position paper aims to pose questions relevant to CHI educators, namely how can these possibilities be woven into existing courses? How might our students contribute to these creative approaches and at what level of maturity shall these tools and techniques be presented alongside more traditional methods? Lastly, we raise ethical questions about the use of these tools and highlight the challenges of using them in the context of design.},

This article will explore how to bring innovative application [7] solutions to closed-loop [8] systems by combining metric analysis and artificial intelligence models. As an important means of evaluating system performance, the accuracy and real-time nature of metric analysis are crucial for system optimization. Additionally, the development of artificial intelligence models provides powerful technological support for innovative applications in closed-loop systems. By combining the two, it is expected to achieve more comprehensive and effective monitoring and management of closed-loop systems, thereby improving system performance and stability.},

  abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has created a level of chaos in higher education as both students and faculty try to determine its utility and how best to incorporate it into the learning process. Students may view generative AI as a means to an end of achieving a perfect grade, skipping important elements of the learning process, or they may view it as an opportunity to expand their creative efforts. Faculty may view it as a tool students use to circumvent plagiarism detection, may feel it potentially minimizes the role of faculty in the classroom, or they may view it as an opportunity to avail of a supplement to existing activities and assignments. Ultimately, faculty are faced with maintaining academic integrity and reinforcing the need and importance of the learning process. This paper explores the combination of three approaches: peer-supported incremental learning, master/apprentice model, and growth mindset as a way for faculty to guide appropriate student use of generative AI, while also maintaining the integrity of the learning process.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the second report on making an integrated AI. Regarding visual processing, YOLOv8 and image2-text are employed to recognize surrounding visional scenes, which output meaningful text to the AI’s text processing unit. In text processing, our previous work employed a question-answering system for questions from humans to the AI. However, in this study we use GPT2 for the convesation between humans and AI. This is because GPT2 has been found to be an excellent natural language processor that can provide appropriate responses to human questions and casual conversations. AI’s response is shown in the form of a 3D avatar animation by using the MakeItTalk routine. In this work we devised a system in which AI can autonomously learn by itself when it does not respond to humans. Namely, about eight news items are obtained from web news. From there, AI generates sentences using GPT2. The repeating process of text generation is accomplished by cutting out several leading words from sentences. As a result, AI’s attention theme is changing to a different topic. In addition, the AI creates a picture of the content by text2image routine. It makes AI’s association in a form that is easy to understand for humans. In this work, the system accomplishes fine-tuning so that these associations could be stored in the AI circuits as distributed weights. In such a way, we have created an integrated system of AI, that behaves like a human being. As described in the text, we may say that our system is superior to human beings in two points. The first is computation speed. We recognize that the association process of AI is far faster than that of humans. The second point is that AI avatars created using diffusion model may be more attractive than real humans. Of course, the present system has problems that need to be improved. However, we can surely say that those problems will be solved with the current technology. In creating an integrated AI, this study shows that it is possible to create an AI that is superior to humans in several ways even in 2024.},

However, decisions in energy systems depend on energy forecasts, and, thus, it is important that models are explainable and trustworthy. Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques exist that add explainability to energy forecasting models, but all existing methods are only post-hoc or do not use weather data on large spatial areas. This paper introduces a novel approach to forecast energy that scales and adds intrinsic explainability by design. Therefore, we use trainable spatial weights to make accurate forecasts on large spatial areas. The trained weights can be interpreted spatially to enhance explainability and increase trust. Furthermore, the spatial weights enable a wide range of future work, including postprocessing, subregion forecasting, hierarchical learning, and spatial-temporal weights.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly adopted by public sector organizations to provide better public services and to transform their internal processes. AI is now considered a key enabler for digital innovation and transformation in the public sector. However, AI is still relatively a new research area in the field of digital government. The term, AI, captures a wide range of technologies, techniques, and tools such as machine/deep learning, natural language processing, robotics, computer vision, and more recently Generative AI. While these AI technologies afford different applications and benefits in the government context, they also create social, ethical, and legal challenges. These challenges require solutions combining both technical (e.g., data and algorithmic solutions to minimize bias) and institutional (e.g., governance structures and processes) mechanisms. The special issue is a collection of articles that contribute to a better understanding of the issues associated with AI deployment in different areas of government operations. They cover AI applications in the areas of emergency response, policy analysis, public bids, and citizen participation. The contributions also address the challenge of realizing a legal transparency regime for AI in government and the effect of AI in bureaucratic decision-making.},

  abstract = {This research explores the application of ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence technology, in the field of education. ChatGPT, short for "generative pre-training," continuously evolves and adapts through user feedback, facilitating authentic human-machine interaction. It can process natural language input and generate relevant responses, thereby providing information and answering questions. The study highlights the potential of ChatGPT in university teacher education, where it can offer intelligent teaching assistance, personalized learning resources, and instructional support. However, the integration of ChatGPT also raises challenges, such as redefining the authority of knowledge and altering the dynamics of the teacher-student relationship. Some scholars contend that ChatGPT cannot replicate genuine emotions or free will, underscoring the irreplaceable nature of education. The transformative impact of ChatGPT on education demands a reevaluation of teachers' roles and professional development in the digital age. This study seeks to clarify the role of teachers within the digital transformation represented by ChatGPT and to explore strategies for successfully navigating this shift. Additionally, the research aims to assess teachers' perceptions and utilization of ChatGPT, address related challenges, and evaluate the feasibility, potential applications, and limitations of its integration into teaching.},

These tools, while impressive, are liable to reproduce, exacerbate, and reinforce extant human social biases, such as gender and racial biases. In this article, we systematically review the extent to which DALL-E Mini suffers from this problem. In line with the Model Card published alongside DALL-E Mini by its creators, we find that the images it produces tend to represent dozens of different occupations as populated either solely by men (e.g., pilot, builder, plumber) or solely by women (e.g., hairdresser, receptionist, dietitian). In addition, the images DALL-E Mini produces tend to represent most occupations as populated primarily or solely by White people (e.g., farmer, painter, prison officer, software engineer) and very few by non-White people (e.g., pastor, rapper). These findings suggest that exciting new AI technologies should be critically scrutinized and perhaps regulated before they are unleashed on society.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the main concerns of knowledge workers due to its ability to mimic realistic human reasoning and creativity. However, this integration raises critical concerns about trust and ethics, which are crucial in shaping both the acceptance and effective utilisation of these technologies. There are many reports, articles and papers currently exploring the opportunities and challenges of LLMs in higher education from the perspective of students and educators. However, these papers often focus on specific contexts like in the UK, US or a particular institutions. In this paper, we examine the problems of generative AI in higher education from educator and student perspectives using scientometrics and text analysis to provide an overview of the research landscape, followed by a narrative review and thematic analysis of selected literature. Some findings of this work are: (1) Students and educators found different ways to use generative AI. Students focus more on using it as an assistant (revising and preparing for lectures, helping with homework) and educators as a content production assistant (writing lecture notes, personalising content). Commonalities are that both students and educators use generative AI as an accessibility aid, e.g., to rephrase sentences or explain concepts. (2) The main concerns of higher education regarding generative AI are equity in access, clarity of rules regarding usage, and job displacement.},

This research uses Nanjing, a representative example of urban culture, as a backdrop to explore immersive visual image design and examine the impact of integrating technology and art on the cultural and creative industries. First, deep learning algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are employed to automatically analyze Nanjing's urban culture and extract visual elements, such as mountains, water, cities, and forests, with local characteristics. Next, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used to generate and optimize the extracted visual elements, organizing them in a systematic manner to enhance the artistic and scientific qualities of the images. Additionally, a highly interactive imaging system is designed by combining ToughDesigner (TD) software with Kinect sensing equipment. Finally, an immersive visual exhibition space is constructed using light and shadow projection technology to showcase Nanjing's urban culture and shape the city's image. This research aims to provide a reference for the future development of new media art, promote the deeper integration of technology and art, and enhance the public's cultural experience and perception of artworks.},

In this paper, we posit that designing human-centered text-to-image AI tools requires a clear understanding of how individuals intuitively approach crafting prompts, and what challenges they may encounter. To address this, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 existing users of a text-to-image AI tool. Our findings (1) offer insights into users’ prompt journey including structures and processes for writing, evaluating, and refining prompts in text-to-image AI tools and (2) indicate that users must overcome barriers to aligning AI to their intents, and mastering prompt crafting knowledge. From the findings, we discuss the prompt journey as an individual yet a social experience and highlight opportunities for aligning text-to-image AI tools and users’ intents.},

Through a qualitative study using ethnographic interviews and participatory observation, this paper explores how GAI impacted the workflows, creative processes, and professional identities of early career game developers. We present a case of GAI integration that was not a straightforward adoption. Focusing on the interns’ resistance, negotiation, and reimagining, we show that the interns were actively developing a new professional culture both with and against generative AI. For the interns, their ethical commitments to fellow game developers and the future of their profession were as important as their practical concerns about usability, utility, and efficacy of GAI tools.},

Utilizing an iterative mechanism, the framework employs a two-step process: data labeling and iterative data cleaning. With few labeled data, IterClean leverages an iterative cleaning process involving an error detector, an error verifier, and an error repairer to significantly enhance the cleaning performance. Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that, IterClean achieves an F1 score that is up to three times higher than the best state-of-the-art approaches requiring only 5 labeled tuples.},

  abstract = {Due to the significant generative capabilities of GenAI (generative artificial intelligence), the art community has actively embraced it to create painterly content. Large text-to-image models can quickly generate aesthetically pleasing outcomes. However, the process can be non-deterministic and often involves tedious trial-and-error as users struggle to formulate effective prompts to achieve their desired results. This paper describes a generative approach that empowers users to easily work with a large text-to-image (TTI) model to create their preferred painterly content. The authors propose a large model personalization method, namely Semantic Injection, to personalize a large TTI model in a given specific artistic style, i.e., Kandinsky’s paintings in Bauhaus era, as the Artist Model. Through working with a Kandinsky expert, the authors first establish a semantic descriptive guideline and a TTI dataset of Kandinsky style and then apply the Semantic Injection method to obtain an Artist Model of Kandinsky, empowering users to create preferred Kandinsky content in a deterministically controllable manner.},

  abstract = {AI-powered education technologies can support students and teachers in computer science education. However, with the recent developments in generative AI, and especially the increasingly emerging popularity of ChatGPT, the effectiveness of using large language models for solving programming tasks has been underexplored. The present study examines ChatGPT’s ability to generate code solutions at different difficulty levels for introductory programming courses. We conducted an experiment where ChatGPT was tested on 127 randomly selected programming problems provided by Kattis, an automatic software grading tool for computer science programs, often used in higher education. The results showed that ChatGPT independently could solve 19 out of 127 programming tasks generated and assessed by Kattis. Further, ChatGPT was found to be able to generate accurate code solutions for simple problems but encountered difficulties with more complex programming tasks. The results contribute to the ongoing debate on the utility of AI-powered tools in programming education.},

  abstract = {Current recommendation methods based on knowledge graphs rely on entity and relation representations for several steps along the pipeline, with knowledge completion and path reasoning being the most influential. Despite their similarities, the most effective representation methods for these steps differ, leading to inefficiencies, limited representativeness, and reduced interpretability. In this paper, we introduce KGGLM, a decoder-only Transformer model designed for generalizable knowledge representation learning to support recommendation. The model is trained on generic paths sampled from the knowledge graph to capture foundational patterns, and then fine-tuned on paths specific of the downstream step (knowledge completion and path reasoning in our case). Experiments on ML1M and LFM1M show that KGGLM beats twenty-two baselines in effectiveness under both knowledge completion and recommendation.

For open education learners who aim to just obtain adult education diplomas, particularly, the cost of learning assessment is becoming increasingly low due to the use of generative AI. How to instructional design and assessment for open education learners in the era of generative AI becomes therefore an issue requiring urgent solutions. From such perspectives as the advantages and disadvantages of generative AI, the learning needs and characteristics of open education learners, and the new characteristics of learning assessment with the use of generative AI, this paper examines the dilemma of instructional design and assessment during the age of generative AI, puts forward the ideas and models for the design of homework for open education learners, and makes learning assessment design proposals with respect to renewing the methods of learning assessment, improving the AI literacy of both teachers and students, etc., with a view to offering some insight for the design of homework in the era of generative AI.},

  abstract = {With the development of the theory and technology of computer science, machine or computer painting is increasingly being explored in the creation of art. Machine-made works are referred to as artificial intelligence (AI) artworks. Early methods of AI artwork generation have been classified as non-photorealistic rendering, and, latterly, neural style transfer methods have also been investigated. As technology advances, the variety of machine-generated artworks and the methods used to create them have proliferated. However, there is no unified and comprehensive system to classify and evaluate these works. To date, no work has generalized methods of creating AI artwork including learning-based methods for painting or drawing. Moreover, the taxonomy, evaluation, and development of AI artwork methods face many challenges. This article is motivated by these considerations. We first investigate current learning-based methods for making AI artworks and classify the methods according to art styles. Furthermore, we propose a consistent evaluation system for AI artworks and conduct a user study to evaluate the proposed system on different AI artworks. This evaluation system uses six criteria: beauty, color, texture, content detail, line, and style. The user study demonstrates that the six-dimensional evaluation index is effective for different types of AI artworks.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized different aspects of society, including higher education. This paper investigates faculty members' perceptions of using artificial intelligence, chatbots, and generative AI in teaching and learning in Uzbeki's higher education contexts. The researchers employed a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to collect the data. Purposeful sampling was employed to select participants in this study, and the interviews were conducted face-to-face at the university campus. The study's underlying theory is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, including effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, which were employed as a lens to direct the research. The data were transcribed and analyzed using the deductive approach for the thematic analysis. The findings revealed that lecturers have a positive attitude to adopt and use AI for content creation, assessment and feedback, and doing research in their institution. Some instructors may see it as a valuable tool for generating creative content and aiding student learning. In contrast, others may have concerns about its potential to replace human creativity or biases in generated materials. Lecturers also view AI as a technology to achieve accessibility and equity after overcoming the challenges. Findings revealed that some measurements should be taken about the facilitating conditions and the perceived risks of using AI.},

  abstract = {Various research studies have been conducted on the topic of students’ conceptions of artificial intelligence (AI), but there is insufficient research into how these conceptions can be changed. In computer science education, there is a need to empirically research solutions or activities for conceptions that have already been discovered in order to make them usable in terms of educational reconstruction and integrate them into instruction. However, this is hardly ever done yet. Our work addresses this issue and can be transferred as a prototype study to other areas of conceptions research in computer science education. To this end, a teaching intervention was conducted with 10th and 11th grade secondary school students in Germany in order to measure the change in their agreement to specific conceptions with the help of pre- and post-tests. This study was conducted with N = 76&nbsp;students who were divided into an experimental and control group. The results of the study show that conceptual change texts are a promising teaching method for expanding students’ conceptions of AI. This is indicated by the results of the post-test, in which students who worked with the conceptual change text were able to demonstrate greater agreement to the conception presented. However, the results of the study needs to be critically discussed in terms of validity and future perspectives.},

As Chairs of this conference, we are delighted to bring together a community of scholars, researchers, and professionals from diverse backgrounds, all driven by a shared passion for advancing the frontiers of knowledge in our field.This workshop aims to explore the potential of large generative models to revolutionize the way we interact with multimodal information. A Large Language Model (LLM) represents a sophisticated form of artificial intelligence engineered to comprehend and produce natural language text, exemplified by technologies such as GPT, LLaMA, Flan-T5, ChatGLM, and Qwen, etc. These models undergo training on extensive text datasets, exhibiting commendable attributes including robust language generation, zero-shot transfer capabilities, and In-Context Learning (ICL). With the surge in multimodal content encompassing images, videos, audio, and 3D models over the recent period, Large MultiModal Models (LMMs) have seen significant enhancements. These improvements enable the augmentation of conventional LLMs to accommodate multimodal inputs or outputs, as seen in BLIP, Flamingo, KOSMOS, LLaVA, Gemini, GPT-4, etc. Concurrently, certain research initiatives have delved into generating specific modalities, with Kosmos2 and MiniGPT-5 focusing on image generation, and SpeechGPT on speech production. There are also endeavors to integrate LLMs with external tools to achieve a near any-to-any multimodal comprehension and generation capacity, illustrated by projects like Visual-ChatGPT, ViperGPT, MMREACT, HuggingGPT, and AudioGPT. Collectively, these models, spanning not only text and image generation but also other modalities, are referred to as large generative models.},

  abstract = {Addressing the performance and efficiency challenges of detecting small target defects on PCB (printed circuit board), this research proposes a lightweight inspection model for YOLOv8-based. The initial step involves employing an enhanced Efficient_Detect network architecture with the aim of diminishing the volume of model parameters and computational intricacy, while simultaneously augmenting resource utilization. Then, the deformable convolutional networks v2 (DCNv2) are integrated into the C2f structure to improve feature extraction for defects with diverse shapes on the PCB surface, enhancing the model's capability to identify different categories of flaws. Meanwhile, the Inner-SIoU loss function is utilized instead of the conventional CIoU loss function to enhance both the precision of inspection and the robustness of the model. The enhanced approach achieves an mAP50 of 96.8\% and an mAP50-95 of 72.2\%, marking an improvement of 3.9\% and 10.1\%, respectively, comparison with base YOLOv8n model. In addition, the parameter counts of the model, GFLOPs, and weight size are notably reduced by 18.4\%, 33.3\%, and 19.7\%, respectively, resulting in final metrics of 2.34 M, 5.4 GFLOPs, and a weight size of 4.9 M. In addition, the detection speed can reach up to 161 FPS, which has the potential for real-time detection. It provides an efficient and lightweight PCB small target defect detection solution for scenarios with limited computing resources.},

Despite the advantages of this trend, it is believed that AI-powered tools should be utilized to enhance the literature review process rather than completely automating it. For this reason, this paper examines the emerging concept of "Literature Review as a Service" (LRaaS) based on the human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) perspective. Drawing on the theoretical background and service science, the paper explores a new approach to exploit the potential of AI-powered tools while putting people at the center of the research process.

  abstract = {Public sector institutions that consult citizens to inform decision-making face the challenge of evaluating the contributions made by citizens. This evaluation has important democratic implications but at the same time, consumes substantial human resources. However, until now the use of artificial intelligence such as computer-supported text analysis has remained an under-studied solution to this problem. We identify three generic tasks in the evaluation process that could benefit from natural language processing (NLP). Based on a systematic literature search in two databases on computational linguistics and digital government, we provide a detailed review of existing methods and their performance. While some promising approaches exist, for instance to group data thematically and to detect arguments and opinions, we show that there remain important challenges before these could offer any reliable support in practice. These include the quality of results, the applicability to non-English language corpuses and making algorithmic models available to practitioners through software. We discuss a number of avenues that future research should pursue that can ultimately lead to solutions for practice. The most promising of these bring in the expertise of human evaluators, for example through active learning approaches or interactive topic modeling.},

Techniques should be presented for generating various IoC(Indicators of Compromise) information from various digital forensic artifacts collected from various IoT devices, and for sharing this information through CTI(Cyber Threat Intelligence) systems such as MISP. In this study, when various artifacts are collected upon intrusion incidents in IoT devices, we propose a method for generating detailed attack information as IoCs and sharing threat information efficiently by applying the Hub \&amp; Spoke model in CTI systems like MISP.

We systematically survey state-of-the-art methods across five critical aspects of building an accurate and robust AI-powered malware-detection model: malware sophistication, analysis techniques, malware repositories, feature selection, and machine learning vs. deep learning. The effectiveness of an AI model is dependent on the quality of the features it is trained with. In turn, the quality and authenticity of these features is dependent on the quality of the dataset and the suitability of the analysis tool. Static analysis is fast but is limited by the widespread use of obfuscation. Dynamic analysis is not impacted by obfuscation but is defeated by ubiquitous anti-analysis techniques and requires more computational power. Sophisticated and evasive malware is challenging to extract authentic discriminatory features from and, combined with poor quality datasets, this can lead to a situation where a model achieves high accuracy with only one specific dataset.},

It requires distinguishing between original ideas and those generated by the model, assessing critical thinking skills, and gauging subject mastery accurately, which can impact fair assessment practices. The Human-Computer Interaction course described in this experience report has enabled consultation with textbooks, slides and other materials for over five years. This experience report describes reflections regarding using ChatGPT as a source of consultation in a written HCI exam in 2023. The paper describes experiences with analysis of the types of questions ChatGPT was able to solve immediately without mediation and the types of questions that could benefit from ChatGPT’s assistance without compromising the assessment of higher-level learning outcomes that professors want to analyse in teaching HCI. The paper uses Bloom’s taxonomy to analyse different questions and abilities to be evaluated and how they can be solved solely by using ChatGPT. The paper discusses questions that need mediation, previous lived experience in class and understanding of the knowledge acquired in class that cannot be answered directly by copying and pasting questions into ChatGPT. The discussions can raise reflections on the learning outcomes that can be assessed in HCI written exams and how professors should reflect upon their experiences and expectations for exams in the age of growing generative artificial intelligence resources.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has made unprecedented advances in vision language models over the past two years. These advances are largely due to diffusion-based generative models, which are very stable and simple to train. These diffusion models are tasked to learn the underlying unknown distribution of the training data samples. During the generative process, new samples (images) are generated from this unknown high-dimensional distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly effective in drawing samples from complex, high-dimensional distributions. This makes MCMC methods an integral component for both the training and sampling phases of these models, ensuring accurate sample generation.Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques.A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples (images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge, linking these closely related areas of research. Our tutorial aims to provide necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

  abstract = {Offline reinforcement learning aims to empower agents to derive effective strategies from a pre-existing dataset for decision-making tasks. This learning paradigm has a broad application prospect in areas with high safety constraints, such as healthcare and robotic control. However, existing offline reinforcement learning algorithms often overlook the impact of the dataset's inherent multimodal distribution on policy optimization during the training phase, leading to compromised model performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel offline reinforcement learning algorithm based on mixture density policy network, MDPo ( Mixture Density Policy). The MDPo algorithm initially employs an expected regression loss function to train the value function. Subsequently, it constructs the policy using a mixture density network and trains the policy through a distributional constraint, ultimately learning a high-quality policy model under the combined influence of the reward signal and policy constraints. Predominantly leveraging mixture density networks, MDPo models the policy as a multimodal distribution, enhancing the policy's representational capacity to better fit the multimodal distribution of actions in the dataset, thereby increasing training process stability and improving model performance. Experiments conducted on the Antmaze task of the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that MDPo significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, also demonstrating the enhancement of training stability.},

In this context, we explore AI as a tool that mediates cultural understanding and remediates human values – that are often influenced by biases and inequities. Using participatory design for learning with a group of 13 children (ages 8-13), we engaged in five co-design sessions featuring different modalities for socio-cultural approaches to AI literacy. We found that children were more aware of the cultural mediation aspect of AI when the content of the interaction aligned with their cultural background and context. This underscored the significance of aligning the representation of culture in these GenAI systems with people’s socio-cultural ecosystems in modern technological literacies. We conclude with design principles for a more critical and holistic approach to AI literacy.},

At the same time, AI is increasingly incorporated into government functions and the public sector. We propose that governments and the public sector can set an example for the responsible use of AI technologies by following the principles of algorithmic governance traditionally recommended to the private sector. Algorithmic governance has traditionally been defined in the literature as governance by algorithms, or how artificial intelligence is used to make governance decisions and affect social ordering. However, we take an alternative approach; instead, we conceptualize algorithmic governance as the governance of algorithms. We begin by summarizing the risks of generative AI use in government, then outline algorithmic governance principles, a step-by-step approach to implementing algorithmic governance into government or public sector projects, opportunities for inter-sector collaboration, and final conclusions.},

  abstract = {Distributed Collaborative Machine Learning (DCML) has emerged in artificial intelligence-empowered edge computing environments, such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), to process tremendous data generated by smart devices. However, parallel DCML frameworks require resource-constrained devices to update the entire Deep Neural Network (DNN) models and are vulnerable to reconstruction attacks. Concurrently, the serial DCML frameworks suffer from training efficiency problems due to their serial training nature. In this paper, we propose a Model Pruning-enabled Federated Split Learning framework (MP-FSL) to reduce resource consumption with a secure and efficient training scheme. Specifically, MP-FSL compresses DNN models by adaptive channel pruning and splits each compressed model into two parts that are assigned to the client and the server. Meanwhile, MP-FSL adopts a novel aggregation algorithm to aggregate the pruned heterogeneous models. We implement MP-FSL with a real FL platform to evaluate its performance. The experimental results show that MP-FSL outperforms the state-of-the-art frameworks in model accuracy by up to 1.35\%, while concurrently reducing storage and computational resource consumption by up to 32.2\% and 26.73\%, respectively. These results demonstrate that MP-FSL is a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by DCML, with superior performance in both reduced resource consumption and enhanced model performance.},

  abstract = {Engineering process management aims to formally specify processes which are executable, measurable, and controllable. Common representations include text-based domain-specific languages (DSLs) or graphical notations such as the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN). The specification itself can be seen as a Software Product Line (SPL), building upon concepts such as tasks, UI forms, fields and actions. Domain experts provide requirements for processes but often lack the technical programming skills to formalize them in a process specification language. We present an interactive SPL application prototype that allows domain experts to model simple processes in natural language. Our framework for the reliable generation of formal specifications with Large Language Models (LLMs) supports the machine-translation from natural language to a JSON-based process DSL. In this case study, five domain experts were asked to model any process of their choice through natural-language interactions. As a result, the user interface corresponding to the process DSL was shown as immediate feedback. We documented their perceived translation quality and interviewed them on their impressions of this methodology. An average user-assessed performance rating of 68\% was achieved. Even though the modelling strategies differed greatly between individuals, the tool was able to adequately capture the majority of instructions, leaving an overall positive impression on the participants. More context awareness and additional conventional interaction elements were the main aspects found to be improved for a productive implementation.},

  abstract = {With the rapid advancements in multimodal generative technology, Affective Computing research has provoked discussion about the potential consequences of AI systems equipped with emotional intelligence. Affective Computing involves the design, evaluation, and implementation of Emotion AI and related technologies aimed at improving people's lives. Designing a computational model in affective computing requires vast amounts of multimodal data, including RGB images, video, audio, text, and physiological signals. Moreover, Affective Computing research is deeply engaged with ethical considerations at various stages'from training emotionally intelligent models on large-scale human data to deploying these models in specific applications. Fundamentally, the development of any AI system must prioritize its impact on humans, aiming to augment and enhance human abilities rather than replace them, while drawing inspiration from human intelligence in a safe and responsible manner. The MRAC 2024 Track 1 workshop seeks to extend these principles from controlled, small-scale lab environments to real-world, large-scale contexts, emphasizing responsible development. The workshop also aims to highlight the potential implications of generative technology, along with the ethical consequences of its use, to researchers and industry professionals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first workshop series to comprehensively address the full spectrum of multimodal, generative affective computing from a responsible AI perspective, and this is the second iteration of this workshop.

  abstract = {Written feedback has long been a cornerstone in educational and professional settings, essential for enhancing learning outcomes. However, multimodal feedback-integrating textual, auditory, and visual cues-promises a more engaging and effective learning experience. By leveraging multiple sensory channels, multimodal feedback better accommodates diverse learning preferences and aids in deeper information retention. Despite its potential, creating multimodal feedback poses challenges, including the need for increased time and resources. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offer solutions to automate the feedback process, predominantly focusing on textual feedback. Yet, the application of GenAI in generating multimodal feedback remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates the use of GenAI techniques to generate multimodal feedback, aiming to provide this feedback for large cohorts of learners, thereby enhancing learning experience and engagement. By exploring the potential of GenAI for this purpose, we propose a framework for automating the generation of multimodal feedback, which we name MuFIN.},

By simplifying the quantification process of risk factors for transportation vehicles passing through densely populated areas, with the goal of minimizing the number of vehicles, the total transportation distance, and the shortest driving distance through densely populated areas, an optimization model for the transportation path problem of hazardous goods vehicles is established. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on probability model is designed for the model. Taking a hazardous material transportation network with 5 transportation vehicles, 24 demand nodes, and 6 densely populated areas as an example, validate the model and algorithm. The example results show that the Pareto solution of the vehicle routing problem can be obtained using this algorithm, providing decision support for the scheduling of hazardous goods transportation vehicles.},

To address this issue, we propose a meta-learning method that integrates multilingual knowledge, which mainly includes two modules: the multilingual knowledge obtain module, which alleviates data scarcity by introducing multilingual knowledge from outside; The meta-learning module utilizes ProtoMAML combined with l₂ standardization to extract language independent causal features from text and learn better event representations in different languages. The experimental results on the latest publicly available MECI dataset show that our model outperforms the current best baseline, with an average F1 improvement of 3.9\% in different languages.},

The strategy integrates adapter technology by incorporating a small-parameter adapter module on the main model, introducing highly adaptive external components tailored to each language pair to alleviate multilingual interference without altering the main model structure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in multilingual translation tasks involving Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Chinese. Compared to traditional multilingual baseline models, this method achieves a significant improvement with an average BLEU score increase of up to 1.34 in many-to-one translation scenarios and 0.7 in one-to-many translation scenarios. This work not only provides strong support for addressing multilingual interference in machine translation of minority languages in China but also opens up new avenues and methods for multilingual translation research in other language pairs.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the multimodal transportation path optimization problem for consumer electronics products under the condition of transport time uncertainty. Approaching the problem from the perspective of multimodal transport operators within a defined network, the study integrates the stochastic travel time, stochastic transfer time, customer demands for timely delivery and the complexity of multiple orders. Combining with the high-value time-sensitive characteristics of consumer electronic products and taking the minimum of total cost as the optimization objective, we establish a multimodal transport path optimization model. In order to solve this model, a genetic algorithm with elite strategy based on Monte Carlo sampling is designed. Finally, we verify the validity of the model and algorithm through a specific case. And the case results are analyzed. The case results indicate that for the long-distance transportation of goods such as consumer electronics, which have a very high time-value cost, it is more appropriate to choose a multimodal transportation scheme based on road and railroad transportation, while waterway transportation does not have an advantage. In addition, further consideration of the uncertainty of the transportation time results in a transportation solution that ensures a higher probability of on-time delivery, while the total cost increases slightly but the transportation time decreases. The transportation scheme is more stable. The results of this paper provide a reference basis for the actual multimodal transportation path optimization problem of consumer electronics.},

  abstract = {Pedestrian detection is commonly studied using visible light (RGB) images. However, in environments with poor lighting or occlusions, the performance of object detection using RGB images tends to be subpar. In contrast, infrared (IR) images yield better results in such special circumstances. Therefore, multispectral image fusion for pedestrian detection is increasingly being adopted. While this feature interaction and fusion approach enhances features, it can also introduce background noise, preventing the model from focusing on pedestrians. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight network with Unet and attention mechanism (UANet). UANet enhances the accuracy of pedestrian detection under varying illuminance by combining the strengths of RGB-IR image pairs. In UANet, a UNet-based module is designed for extracting and reusing multi-scale features from RGB images. To further extract high-level features, we incorporate a fully connected module into the UNet-based module. For infrared images, we employ high-frequency attention and average attention to extract target features from infrared images and fuse them with RGB features. In experiments, we validate the effectiveness of UANet in improving pedestrian detection performance. We conducted tests on the KAIST dataset, yielding a result of 95.23\% mAP and 7.65\% MR.},

We applied a convergent mixed-methods approach to offer a comprehensive understanding of AI adoption dynamics. We initially conducted a questionnaire survey with 100 software engineers, drawing upon the Technology Acceptance Model, the Diffusion of Innovation Theory, and the Social Cognitive Theory as guiding theoretical frameworks. Employing the Gioia methodology, we derived a theoretical model of AI adoption in software engineering: the Human-AI Collaboration and Adaptation Framework. This model was then validated using Partial Least Squares–Structural Equation Modeling based on data from 183 software engineers. Findings indicate that at this early stage of AI integration, the compatibility of AI tools within existing development workflows predominantly drives their adoption, challenging conventional technology acceptance theories. The impact of perceived usefulness, social factors, and personal innovativeness seems less pronounced than expected. The study provides crucial insights for future AI tool design and offers a framework for developing effective organizational implementation strategies.},

Existing methods based on soft tissue or DNA can be unavailable if the body is badly decomposed, white-ossified, or charred. However, bones last a long time. This raises a natural question: can we learn to identify a person using bone data? We present a novel feature of bones called Neural Boneprint for personal identification. In particular, we exploit the thoracic skeletal data including chest radiographs (CXRs) and computed tomography (CT) images enhanced by the volume rendering technique (VRT) as an example to explore the availability of the neural boneprint. We then represent the neural boneprint as a joint latent embedding of VRT images and CXRs through a bidirectional cross-modality translation and contrastive learning. Preliminary experimental results on real skeletal data demonstrate the effectiveness of the Neural Boneprint for identification. We hope that this approach will provide a promising alternative for challenging forensic cases where conventional methods are limited.

However, low-resource languages face a challenge as the availability of bilingual parallel corpora is limited, leading to subpar translation performance. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a data augmentation approach based on semantic word replacement specifically designed for neural machine translation of low-resource languages. The method comprises two key steps: firstly, expanding the corpus of low-resource languages through semantic word replacement techniques; secondly, utilizing a neural grammar correction model to proofread the augmented bilingual parallel corpora. Subsequently, these corrected corpora are merged with the original corpus to mitigate the data scarcity for low-resource languages. Experimental evaluations were conducted on various low-resource language pairs (including Mongolian-Chinese, Tibetan-Chinese, Uyghur-Chinese, Arabic-Chinese) as well as English-German and German-English translation tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the translation quality of low-resource languages, achieving a maximum BLEU score improvement of up to 3.06 compared to the baseline system, underscoring the efficacy of the approach.},

However, adapting the upstream large-scale pre-training model to downstream tasks with specific requirements, such as building extraction, often encounters significant challenges due to the complex spatial relationships present in remote sensing images. To address this issue, we proposed a novel building extraction network named Natural Language Guided Building Extraction with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (NLG-ExtractClip) to use natural language to guide building extraction. Specifically, we introduce a Natural Language Guiding Module (NLGM) to generate remote sensing image captions with rich spatial information, and then use CLIP Text Encoder to generate Guiding Text Embeddings. We use a Multimodal Fusion Attention Module (MFAM) to combine textual information with the visual features of remote sensing images to adapt to building extraction specific tasks. Our experiments on two building extraction datasets show that our proposed method performs better than other compared methods.},

In this paper, the influence of the structure size, circuit connection mode and fixing mode of the 0kHz-35kHz receiving transducer on the performance of the receiving transducer is numerically simulated. It is concluded that shorter and thicker piezoelectric patches can effectively improve the receiving sensitivity, bandwidth and stability of the receiving transducer. The series circuit connection mode has good reception sensitivity stationarity, and the reception sensitivity stationarity is improved by 23.8dB, but its reception sensitivity stationarity is extremely poor. The fixed boundary condition at both ends can obviously broaden the receiving bandwidth of impulse sound source receiver and transducer, but the receiving sensitivity of fixed boundary condition at both ends is smaller than that of free boundary condition and free boundary condition at one end. This conclusion has theoretical reference significance for the manufacture of impulse sound source receiving transducer.},

In this paper, we analyze capabilities and limitations of incorporating such models in conversational interfaces for the telecommunication domain, specifically for enterprise wireless products and services. Using Cradlepoint’s publicly available data for our experiments, we present a comparative analysis of the responses from such models for multiple use-cases including domain adaptation for terminology and product taxonomy, context continuity, robustness to input perturbations and errors. We believe this evaluation would provide useful insights to data scientists engaged in building customized conversational interfaces for domain-specific requirements.},

  abstract = {Synchronized acoustic-articulatory data is the basis of various applications, such as exploring the fundamental mechanisms of speech production, acoustic to articulatory inversion (AAI), articulatory to acoustic mapping, etc. Most of the studies in these fields directly trained various models with EMA-synchronized speech, while the target inputs or outputs are stand-alone speech in real applications. However, the recording conditions of EMA-synchronized speech and stand-alone speech are different, which may make the EMA-synchronized speech different to the stand-alone speech and degrade the performance of downstream tasks. Hence, it is necessary to shed light on whether the EMA-synchronized speech and stand-alone speech signals are different, and if so, how this affects the performance of the models trained with synchronized acoustic-articulatory data. In this study, we explore differences between EMA-synchronized speech and stand-alone speech from the aspect of speech recognition, and its influence on the performance of AAI. The results indicate the performance of phone error rate increases from 7.8\% for stand-alone speech to 37.4\% for EMA-synchronized speech, and the RMSE increases from 0.71mm for EMA- synchronized speech to 3.07mm when the input is switched from EMA-synchronized speech to stand-alone speech for the AAI model trained with EMA-synchronized speech.},

This data includes sensitive information about students’ personal information and learning records, so protecting the security of this data becomes critical. The traditional AES encryption algorithm has been widely used, but as computing power increases, the risk of cracking it also increases. Therefore, this article studies an online education big data encryption algorithm based on artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted optimization, focusing on AI technology to help analyze and process large-scale online education data, and the use of AI technology to optimize traditional Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm. The results of the two sets of simulation experiments are as follows: the average cracking success rate after optimization is 0.028\%, which is one-fifth of that before optimization, and the encryption time is reduced by about 37 seconds on average. This research can enhance users' trust in data privacy, thereby promoting users to participate more actively in online learning activities.},

It analyzes the opportunities and challenges presented by this technology. Universities need to adapt to this transformation by altering the nature of student assignments and the methods of assessment. Additionally, they must effectively leverage the advantages of students conveniently acquiring knowledge through AIGC and the opportunity for personalized tutoring across various subjects.

This article uses a simulation platform to study the safety and stability control strategies of a new energy hydrogen production project's power grid under different operating modes. The study found that the system based on conventional PID control is difficult to achieve fast and stable results. Therefore, a new energy hydrogen production power grid optimization scheduling method based on artificial intelligence algorithms is proposed. Simulation results show that this optimization scheduling method is more effective, especially in extreme emergency situations where stable control strategies are used to quickly cut off power or load and there is still a large unbalanced power. This optimization scheduling method can quickly stabilize the frequency of the new energy hydrogen production power grid and ensure power supply reliability.},

This study introduces a novel framework for optimizing e-commerce logistics by integrating AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with Back Propagation (BP) neural networks, further refined through Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization. Utilizing cargo volume data over a two-year period, we developed a sophisticated ARIMA-BP model to forecast the daily cargo volume for each route for the subsequent month. The subsequent application of a GA-optimized BP neural network aims to achieve a multi-objective optimization, focusing on minimizing the impact of route disruptions and balancing workload distribution across the network. We employed network centrality measures—degree, closeness, and betweenness—to evaluate the significance of logistics sites and routes, enhancing the network's resilience and operational efficiency. This approach also facilitated the integration of new logistics sites and routes, bolstering network performance. Further, we introduced a stochastic perturbation technique to explore the network's adaptability to both anticipated and unforeseen flow changes post-route closure. Finally, complex network topology analysis was applied to assess the robustness of the logistics network. Our methodology exemplifies a comprehensive strategy for e-commerce logistics optimization, offering a robust framework for enhancing network resilience and efficiency in face of emergencies, thereby contributing to the reduction of operational costs and improvement of service quality.},

The main focus of this research is on real-time observation of objects in a given context, which leads to a summary of the behaviors or interactions of the objects. Due to the lack of time automated monitoring and analysis, an operator must either watch a large amount of video data in time with complete attention to detect any irregularities or incidents, or only after the unusual incident has happened may the video data be used as evidence.

  abstract = {Generative AI has made impressive strides in enabling users to create diverse and realistic visual content such as images, videos, and audio. However, training generative models on large centralized datasets can pose challenges in terms of data privacy, security, and accessibility. Federated learning (FL) is an approach that uses decentralized techniques to collaboratively train a shared deep learning model while retaining the training data on individual edge devices to preserve data privacy. This paper proposes a novel method for training a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) across multiple data sources using FL techniques. Diffusion models, a newly emerging generative model, show promising results in achieving superior quality images than Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our proposed method Phoenix is an unconditional diffusion model that leverages strategies to improve the data diversity of generated samples even when trained on data with statistical heterogeneity or Non-IID (Non-Independent and Identically Distributed) data. We demonstrate how our approach outperforms the default diffusion model in a FL setting. These results indicate that high-quality samples can be generated by maintaining data diversity, preserving privacy, and reducing communication between data sources, offering exciting new possibilities in the field of generative AI.},

Through the practice of AI in the field of design in recent years, the article combs and summarizes its excellent examples, focuses on the pioneering and mining of AI-driven design innovation, and thus leads to the discussion of the future development of intelligent design.},

  abstract = {Landscape renderings are realistic images of landscape sites, allowing stakeholders to perceive better and evaluate design ideas. While recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI (generative artificial intelligence)) enable automated generation of landscape renderings, the End to End (endtoend) methods are not compatible with common design processes, leading to insufficient alignment with design idealizations and limited cohesion of iterative landscape design. Informed by a formative study for comprehending design requirements, we present PlantoGraphy, an iterative design system that allows for interactive configuration of generative artificial intelligence models to accommodate human-centered design practice. A two-stage pipeline is incorporated: first, the concretization module transforms conceptual ideas into concrete scene layouts with a domain-oriented large language model; and second, the illustration module converts scene layouts into realistic landscape renderings with a layout-guided diffusion model Fine-tune (finetune)ed through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (lora). PlantoGraphy has undergone a series of performance evaluations and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in landscape rendering generation and the high recognition of its interactive functionality.},

Using a comparative research methodology, the study analyzed the most recent policy documents from these regions through text-mining techniques to assess their key differences in terms of word frequency and specific content. This work highlights the different strategies, goals, and approaches to regulating generative AI across the regions. It found that the EU adopts a more comprehensive and stringent regulation of generative AI, emphasizing regional harmonization and foresight; the U.S. regulation is characterized by pragmatism, closely aligned with industry innovation, and a focus on risk avoidance; while China focuses more on macro-level regulation aimed at promoting innovation and encouraging ecological construction.Participants may be interested in this study because it not only uses up-to-date materials but also employs text-mining methods to present the findings in a clearer way than previous studies. It provides insights into how regulatory policies for generative AI affect the development and practice of digital government. The study sheds light on different countries’ strategies for technology governance, which is crucial for understanding and designing effective digital government policies. In addition, due to the potential of generative AI technologies to deliver public services and drive government transparency, these insights help participants better assess the opportunities and challenges of technological innovation in the digital government space.},

  abstract = {Kenya’s healthcare system is confronted with significant challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, workforce shortages, and a heavy disease burden, which collectively hinder its ability to deliver effective and sustainable healthcare services. The integration of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain presents potential solutions to these issues, but their successful adoption requires addressing critical gaps in policy, infrastructure, and workforce development.This paper builds on Tlhokomelo Rethabile Monethi’s research, which critiques Dependency Theory by exploring how AI and blockchain can reduce Kenya’s reliance on the Global North while enhancing healthcare outcomes. Through qualitative desktop research, the paper analyses existing policies and legislative frameworks, identifying obstacles and proposing practical policy recommendations for the effective integration of these technologies into Kenya’s healthcare system. The analysis covers multiple sectors, including infrastructure, public funding, education, workforce development, and environmental management, ensuring that recommendations are grounded in a comprehensive understanding of Kenya’s regulatory landscape.The findings emphasise the importance of balancing technological advancement with respect for local cultural and ethical values. By implementing the proposed policy reforms, Kenya can foster a self-sufficient and sustainable healthcare system that reduces dependency on external resources, while improving healthcare outcomes for its population.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) represents a crucial subset of AI models characterized by their ability to generate new content based on user input, showing vast potential to transform learning and teaching. However, educators have raised ethical concerns, particularly regarding the adverse effect on students' learning if students simply parrot generative AI-generated content without engaging in critical analysis or original thought. Moreover, there exists the potential of generative AI to perpetuate existing biases in training data. This editorial discusses three major concerns in generative AI use in education and proposes questions (on task-AI fit and people-AI fit) and approaches to address the ethical considerations by adopting five principles of AI ethics. The editorial also discusses developing a classroom AI use policy as one governance mechanism for promoting ethical use of AI. As generative AI technology continues to evolve, so must our educational practices. The editorial ends with a call for readers (educators) to collaboratively define the terms of engagement with generative AI in educational settings and to begin this discourse by sharing insights and experiences with promoting ethical use of generative AI.},

  abstract = {Stable Diffusion has recently emerged as a groundbreaking technique in the field of generative artificial intelligence. By utilizing concise text prompts, Stable Diffusion is capable of producing images that are either strikingly realistic or visually stunning, bridging the gap between textual descriptions and visual representations. A notable challenge associated with Stable Diffusion is the retrieval of corresponding prompts from generated images. To tackle this challenge, we employed a strategy that leverages the capabilities of the ConvNeXt model within the OpenCLIP framework. Having trained the model on an extensive dataset of nearly 2.1 million Stable Diffusion generated images, we then subjected our approach to the evaluation of the Kaggle Stable Diffusion - Image to Prompts competition. The effectiveness of our methodology is underscored by a mean cosine similarity score of 0.63032 between the predicted and actual prompt embedding vectors on the private test set, securing a silver medal position. This achievement not only attests to the robustness of our approach but also signifies its potential in diverse sectors where the retrieval of text from images is of great importance.},

  abstract = {Fostering students’ interests in learning is considered to have many positive downstream effects. Large language models have opened up new horizons for generating content tuned to one’s interests, yet it is unclear in what ways and to what extent this customization could have positive effects on learning. To explore this novel dimension, we conducted a between-subjects online study (n=272) featuring different variations of a generative AI vocabulary learning app that enables users to personalize their learning examples. Participants were randomly assigned to control (sentence sourced from pre-existing text) or experimental conditions (generated sentence or short story based on users’ text input). While we did not observe a difference in learning performance between the conditions, the analysis revealed that generative AI-driven context personalization positively affected learning motivation. We discuss how these results relate to previous findings and underscore their significance for the emerging field of using generative AI for personalized&nbsp;learning.},

We propose a framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate contextual, useful, answerable, fluent and diverse questions about products, via in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Recommending these questions to customers as helpful suggestions or hints to both start and continue a conversation can result in a smoother and faster shopping experience with reduced conversation overhead and friction. We perform extensive offline evaluations, and discuss in detail about potential customer impact, and the type, length and latency of our generated product questions if incorporated into a real-world shopping assistant.},

This study examines early user reactions to GenAI, consisting of 725 Reddit threads between 06/2022 and 05/2023. Through natural language processing (NLP) and content analysis, we observe an increasingly negative sentiment in the discussion and identify six main categories of student and faculty experiences of GenAI in education. These experiences reflect concerns about academic integrity and AI’s negative impact on the values of traditional education. Our analysis also highlights the tension and burden imposed by new technologies. Our findings suggest that dialogue between stakeholders in the education community is critical and can mitigate sources of tension between students and faculty.},

  abstract = {In practical application environments, the task of piano music transcription confronts a series of challenges including the long-tail distribution characteristics of training data, inadequate transcription accuracy in multi-key scenarios, interference from environmental noise, and the inability of mobile devices to meet the demands of real-time transcription. This study builds upon the Onsets and Frames model and introduces a series of structural improvements aimed at enhancing model performance. These include the simplification and optimization of the model structure, the introduction of data augmentation strategies, and the refinement of the loss function. Precise quantization of the model, coupled with effective mobile deployment strategies, ensures the efficient operation of the model on mobile devices. Experimental validation in the mobile environment demonstrates that the proposed improvements significantly enhance transcription accuracy in various scenarios, achieving a 56.98\% increase in transcription speed compared to the original model, thereby meeting the requirements for real-time transcription. Moreover, the new model exhibits substantial noise resistance capabilities, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions where the performance degradation is considerably less than that of the original model.},

  abstract = {Automatic melanoma detection from dermoscopic skin samples is one of the most challenging tasks in medical image analysis. Deep Convolutional Networks (DCN) have emerged as practical tools in addressing these challenges, particularly in skin cancer diagnosis. The research aims to explore the performance of various neural networks in skin cancer recognition, assessing metrics such as accuracy (ACC), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The study uses modified DCN classifiers, namely ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121, on the HAM10000 dataset. The results demonstrate that the modified InceptionV3 exhibited high performance compared to other networks, achieving a weighted accuracy of 86.58\% and a weighted ROC of 0.96. This model's advantage lies in its efficient feature extraction capability and acceptable inference time per epoch. The study concludes that DCN provides a reliable framework for automating melanoma diagnosis and expediting identification, potentially saving lives. The paper also delves into the dataset preprocessing, model optimization strategies, and detailed performance analysis of the modified models. Key findings include the superior performance of the modified InceptionV3 in skin cancer classification and its potential to enhance early skin cancer detection, aligning with developing an efficient melanoma detection method.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses transformative and disruptive challenges for democracy, for policy makers, and for government agencies. While various policy initiatives around the world seek to regulate AI, in the United States (US) federal government there is no sign of a comprehensive AI law, and few legal measures to enable or restrict AI have been proposed and passed. However, states across the US are active in attempting to address issues related to AI and have proposed hundreds of legislations related to AI in the past few years. In this paper, we examined what these legislations have sought to accomplish in relation to AI, and the potential impacts for the public in general and for public administration in particular. From a preliminary and descriptive analysis of all US state legislations related to AI passed from 2019 to 2023, we show how these legislations are addressing AI in terms of: (1) the types of legislations adopted or enacted; (2) the definitions of AI and associated technologies given; (3) the sectors and domains principally addressed in AI legislations; (4) the private sector and government actions directed by the legislations; and (5) how ethical and economic considerations are addressed. We generally found a lack of definition of AI, and associated technologies mentioned are rarely specific. Many of the laws create commissions or task forces to study AI, addressing the various practical and ethical issues related to AI. Legislations have created some regulations and support for industry, and have directed government agencies to identify existing AI capabilities and how AI may be employed in their agencies and jurisdictions. Considerable emphasis has been placed on issues of bias and discrimination, as well education and economic investment in AI, although unevenly distributed across states. We summarize and discuss these results in relation to existing literature and make some recommendations on how state legislatures may better address AI in the future.},

At the same time, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a very successful paradigm for a variety of machine learning tasks. In this survey, we discuss the state of the art, opportunities and open research questions in applying RL to generative AI. In particular, we will discuss three types of applications, namely, RL as an alternative way for generation without specified objectives; as a way for generating outputs while concurrently maximizing an objective function; and, finally, as a way of embedding desired characteristics, which cannot be easily captured by means of an objective function, into the generative process. We conclude the survey with an in-depth discussion of the opportunities and challenges in this fascinating emerging area.},

  abstract = {The traditional evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems is generally very costly as it requires manual relevance annotation from human experts. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence -specifically large language models (LLMs)- can generate relevance annotations at an enormous scale with relatively small computational costs. Potentially, this could alleviate the costs traditionally associated with IR evaluation and make it applicable to numerous low-resource applications. However, generated relevance annotations are not immune to (systematic) errors, and as a result, directly using them for evaluation produces unreliable results.In this work, we propose two methods based on prediction-powered inference and conformal risk control that utilize computer-generated relevance annotations to place reliable confidence intervals (CIs) around IR evaluation metrics. Our proposed methods require a small number of reliable annotations from which the methods can statistically analyze the errors in the generated annotations. Using this information, we can place CIs around evaluation metrics with strong theoretical guarantees. Unlike existing approaches, our conformal risk control method is specifically designed for ranking metrics and can vary its CIs per query and document. Our experimental results show that our CIs accurately capture both the variance and bias in evaluation based on LLM annotations, better than the typical empirical bootstrapping estimates. We hope our contributions bring reliable evaluation to the many IR applications where this was traditionally infeasible.},

  abstract = {Currently, China's demand for energy is increasing. In order to reduce China's dependence on traditional mineral energy, some achievements have been made in increasing research and development efforts in new energy. With the continuous increase in the scale of new energy grid connection, the proportion of new energy grid connection is constantly increasing, and problems such as grid stability and power quality degradation are becoming increasingly prominent, which directly affects the widespread application of new energy generation technology. This article explored the research on a remote control system for new energy grid connected power generation based on artificial intelligence. Taking the island detection of photovoltaic grid connected inverters based on Adaboost algorithm as an example, the feasibility of the technology was verified through experiments.

  abstract = {Search and recommender systems should prioritize support for user tasks over support for individual queries or actions. To that end, the Information Retrieval (IR) community has spent decades trying to understand users' tasks and their contexts, and how to best assist users in making progress toward completing them. The recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have drastically shifted the landscape of task-focused IR. Users can now express not only their queries and questions, but actual information needs, tasks, and goals in natural language to an AI system and receive not just results, but also answers in natural language that are generated specifically for them. This new paradigm raises many interesting questions, opportunities, and challenges. We brought together a group of highly motivated students and scholars in a two-day workshop on the Microsoft campus in Redmond to discuss these issues, learn from each other, and envision a new future for task-focused IR and information access more broadly.Date: 28--29 September 2023.Website: https://ir-ai.github.io.},

  abstract = {The graph coloring problem is a classic NP-hard problem in the field of computer science, with significant applications in various practical domains such as timetabling, frequency allocation, and register allocation. As the scale of data increases and the complexity of problems grows, traditional algorithms often struggle to find optimal solutions within a reasonable timeframe. This study primarily explores the effectiveness and performance of two artificial intelligence algorithms—Backtracking and the Welch-Powell algorithm—in addressing the graph coloring problem. Through experimental analysis and comparison, we aim to evaluate the adaptability and efficiency of these two methods across different types and scales of graph structures. The experimental results indicate that the Backtracking algorithm exhibits faster solution times and produces higher quality solutions compared to the Welch-Powell algorithm in solving the graph coloring problem.},

In order to improve the efficiency of reservoir dynamics analysis and decision-making, an intelligent reservoir dynamics analysis platform based on a cloud platform and artificial intelligence analysis methods was established in Qinghai Oilfield. The intelligent reservoir dynamic analysis platform integrates heterogeneous data from multiple sources, establishes scenario-based reservoir dynamic analysis topics, forms a four-level dynamic analysis structure of well-well group-layer-reservoir, and implements functions such as reservoir evaluation indicators calculation, reservoir dynamic early warning analysis, reservoir development parameters optimization, and reservoir development evaluation. Based on this platform, Qinghai Oilfield has achieved the intelligent practice of reservoir dynamic analysis with integrated geological engineering technology. Through the intelligent practice of reservoir dynamic analysis, Qinghai Oilfield has greatly improved the efficiency of reservoir development and production, and the digital and intelligent development has been promoted.},

  abstract = {The Putian dialect is an ancient language with a rich historical and cultural background. Currently, there is a lack of published research on automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology for the Putian dialect due to various reasons. One notable example is the absence of an audio corpus specifically for this dialect. Moreover, the pronunciation of Putian dialect significantly differs from that of Mandarin used in our daily lives. This paper aims to address these challenges by collecting 8000 isolated words from a phonetic corpus dedicated to the Putian dialect. Based on this self-built database, I attempt to achieve speech recognition for the Putian dialect using various models such as single phoneme model recognition, three-phoneme model, linear discriminant analysis, maximum likelihood change, speaker adaptive training, quick model and DNN-HMM model. Notably, the DNN-HMM-2 model yields the best results with a word error rate of 20.56\%. In this experiment, I introduce an additional layer of mapping in order to construct a two-step mapping method for phoneme - Putian dialect - Mandarin alignment. This approach improves training alignment accuracy and reduces character error rate by approximately 3\% compared to using only one-level mapping.},

  abstract = {In recent years, with the development of the Internet, APT malware detection remains an important issue for society. The lengthy nature of API sequence text leads to polysemy issues with distant repeated words. Traditional deep learning models must improve extracting the long-term dependencies of entire API sequences. During an APT attack, attackers combine benign and malicious sequences to conceal their malicious intent, resulting in localized malignancy. In response to these issues, the paper proposes A BERT-Transformer-TextCNN model for attack detection. BERT encodes API sequences, addressing the polysemy issue of distant repeated words. The Transformer-encoder extracts long-term dependencies, resolving the global feature issues of long sequences, and TextCNN is applied to capture local sequence information to solve the problem of localized malignancy. Based on actual APT malware samples, BERT encoding achieves higher precision than traditional encoders. Employing a Transformer-Encoder to extract long-term dependencies yields higher precision than using BiLSTM to extract long-term relationships. When adding features related to local feature correlation, the precision increased by 3.39\%.},

And based on this, the appropriate plan execution plan is selected, which greatly improves the system's handling efficiency of emergency cases. The experimental results were used to prove the efficiency of the system in selecting similar cases.

  abstract = {The co-occurring sector trends in the stock market reveal interdependencies among certain industry sectors. This study proposes a novel approach to construct index features by leveraging this correlation phenomenon to forecast the future trends of sector indices. By computing the correlation coefficients between sector indices, sectors with strong positive correlations with a specific sector are identified. The historical trends of these strongly correlated sectors are extracted, and a joint forecasting model based on Long Short-term Memory Networks (LSTM) is established. Multi-dimensional time-series features are extracted to predict the future trend changes of specific sector indices. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves effective results in predicting the trends of some industry sectors, obtaining weighted F1 score greater than 0.75 for multiple industry sectors such as Automotive Services and Energy Metals. The findings of this study suggest that leveraging industry sector correlations can enhance the accuracy and reliability of index trend forecasting, albeit with attention required to market risks and model errors in practical applications.

In recent years, artificial intelligence education has gradually been promoted and popularized in primary and secondary schools across the country and has become a key focus of educational researchers. However, the popularization of artificial intelligence education in primary and secondary schools is currently in the initial exploration stage, and research related to artificial intelligence classrooms is relatively lacking. Therefore, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the artificial intelligence classroom in primary schools, this study starts from the perspective of interactive behavior in artificial intelligence classroom teaching in primary schools. Based on the improved Flanders Interaction Analysis System (iFIAS), video analysis method is adopted, and actual teaching videos of primary school artificial intelligence classroom are selected as the research object. The analysis is conducted from aspects such as the interactive structure of artificial intelligence classroom teaching and the tendency of teacher interaction style, In order to explore the interactive behavior patterns of teaching in artificial intelligence classrooms in primary schools, and lay the foundation for subsequent practical research on artificial intelligence classroom teaching.},

  abstract = {In response to the problem of complex visual feature categories and sparse datasets for related refined categories in traffic accidents, this article has created a traffic accident target detection dataset, the AccOD dataset, which is divided into five categories. This dataset can serve as a benchmark for training and evaluating traffic accident target detection algorithms. Aiming at the real-time, accuracy, and intelligence issues of traffic accident detection, an improved traffic accident target detection network based on YOLOv8 is proposed. This network replaces a more efficient backbone network structure and improves the downsampling module that integrates different scale features in the head network, reducing the number of model parameters and computational complexity while improving the detection accuracy of the model. The C2f module is improved to balance various contextual information, further enhancing the detection ability of the model. The experiment showed that the improved model achieved a 4.75\% improvement in mAP0.5 and 4.58\% improvement in mAP0.5:0.95 on the AccOD dataset compared to YOLOv8n, and a 2.14\% improvement in mAP0.5 and 6.23\% improvement in mAP0.5:0.95 on the open source ACD dataset. This algorithm improves the detection accuracy of traffic accidents and maintains the lightweight of the model, providing an effective method for intelligent traffic accident detection.},

  abstract = {In addressing the limited receptive field of single-layer convolution in EEG emotion recognition, the need to stack multiple layers of convolution for expanding the receptive field poses challenges of increased parameter size and training cost. Simultaneously, there is an oversight of channel information in EEG emotion recognition. To tackle these issues, this paper introduces a multi-feature EEG emotion recognition model based on 1D-Inception (1D-Inception-Channel-Spatial-LSTM Network, DCSL). DCSL integrates channel information, spatial features, and temporal dependencies, resulting in more effective EEG emotion recognition. The Inception structure is enhanced to fit EEG signals, enabling multi-scale convolution. The Channel Attention Module is introduced to learn the weights of different channels, enhancing emotion recognition performance. Additionally, a Spatial Attention mechanism is incorporated to further extract spatial features from EEG signals. To better capture the temporal dependencies in EEG signals, an LSTM module is introduced at the end of the model. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the DCSL network in EEG emotion recognition tasks.},

Experiments show that reinforcement learning method can use the same reward function for similar intelligent agents, so as to achieve action decisions that conform to the game world view and set after training. It can complete the construction of game AI without reorganizing the decision structure, and improve the intelligence level of intelligent agents in the game.},

However, current music recommendation methods are mainly recommended through collaborative filtering, content-based, and manual rule methods, and cannot be recommended based on the user's real-time status, resulting in the recommended music does not meet the real-time needs of users. In response to this situation, this paper proposes a personalized music recommendation model based on human physiological signals. This model first analyzes the user's physiological data, such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, etc., and uses a graph convolutional neural network algorithm to perceive the user's real-time emotional state. It then achieves more accuracy and personalization music recommendations based on the relationship model between emotion and music selection. This research not only expands the research scope in the field of music recommendation, but also provides new ideas and methods for the further development of intelligent music recommendation systems.},

  abstract = {Sentiment analysis technology is widely used in many fields such as network public opinion. It has important research significance in the field of natural language processing. In many network texts, sentiment analysis of each entity has always been an important issue. The traditional Bi-LSTM model has the problem of gradient explosion or excessive correction in the learning rate, which affects the convergence speed and stability of the model. In this paper, a Bi-LSTM optimization model combining progressive preheating and cosine annealing is proposed, which uses word embedding technology, word shape reduction technology and named entity recognition technology. Experiments show that our model can achieve high accuracy on both the training set and the verification set, and the loss is gradually reduced. It shows an accuracy of up to 84.13 \% in both positive and negative categories, which is significantly better than the existing baseline model. Through in-depth comparative analysis, the model shows obvious advantages in key performance indicators such as accuracy, recall rate and F1 value.},

  abstract = {This study delves into the impact of artificial intelligence on students’ learning.The paper pioneers the use of k-means classification to reduce the dimensionality of features before the classification process, which minimizes redundant information and computational overhead. This step is not commonly found in prior research.Firstly, a random forest model is established with “whether AI assistance was used to complete the paper” as the output, and various features as inputs. The analysis of the predictive accuracy when changing input features reveals the degree of influence of each feature on using AI to complete the paper. After feature selection, the remaining 6 features can still effectively predict the use of AI to complete the paper, indicating the representativeness of the extracted indicators. Subsequently, the PCA-K-means algorithm is employed to classify the use of artificial intelligence. PCA algorithm is used for dimensionality reduction of the extracted features to better characterize students’ use of AI. Three representative variables are selected, and the contribution of each feature is computed based on the factor loading matrix. Finally, the K-means algorithm is used to classify students based on the three-dimensional features, showing that students can be effectively classified into 2 categories. The results indicate that the majority of students support the use of AI technology to enhance their abilities, although some students may only intend to use AI to cope with exams and similar tasks.},

  abstract = {Due to the inherent differences in grammar structures, cultural customs, and social contexts among various languages, the current efficacy of machine translation still falls short of meeting individuals' diverse and nuanced needs. Merely isolated training in translation skills proves inadequate in nurturing the caliber of high-quality translation professionals required today. In this regard, a comprehensive translation education must encompass practical skills and a strong foundation in theoretical knowledge. Consequently, there arises a necessity for the integration of vocational translation education with a substantial theoretical and academic framework. In light of this, the present study delves into the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology for a comparative analysis between human and machine translations. The research findings underscore the promising potential of the proposed AI-driven approach, showcasing a relatively robust accuracy rate of 73.96\% across human-machine translation evaluations. These outcomes undeniably highlight the efficacy of the method elucidated in the study's framework, particularly in the realm of human-machine translation evaluations. The implications of these findings are far-reaching, potentially smoothing the transition into the field of translation, especially for individuals endowed with broad-ranging knowledge and adept oral communication skills. Such proficiencies not only constitute fundamental requisites for advanced interpretation training but also serve as pivotal prerequisites for cultivating highly proficient English-Chinese communicators.},

  abstract = {After the construction of Deep Cement Mixing (DCM) piles underwater, due to the formed strength, it is difficult to repair any unqualified pile. The only option is to supplement with additional piles in the nearby area. However, in some construction areas with high requirements for project quality and settlement, full-scale reinforcement is needed, leaving no room even for supplementary piling, posing challenges to quality control. There is a large amount of research on the strength prediction of cement soil indoor mix ratio tests both domestically and internationally, but they fail to consider the parameter changes during actual construction. In this paper, based on real-time raw data from inspection piles of actual construction projects, a "survey-construction-inspection" associated data set is established. Quality prediction is performed using three methods: BP neural network, random forest, and support vector machine regression. Among them, the random forest has the best prediction effect, with a mean square error of 0.86MPa in the test set and an average relative error of 15.8\%. Based on this technology, the quality of the formed piles can be predicted immediately after construction. Pile sections at risk of poor quality can be timely grouted and mixed to improve project quality.},

  abstract = {With the development of technology, AI technology is gradually on the rise. Moreover, it has established close connections with various other fields. Biology, chemistry, geology, and so on are all closely related to the environment we live in. Therefore, exploring the extent of the connections between these three fields and AI is beneficial for us to have a clearer understanding of the applications of AI technology in these areas. To investigate the connections between AI artificial intelligence and these three disciplines, we crawled the top 10,000 most cited articles in each field from the Semantic Scholar [8] website, along with their corresponding paper IDs and author IDs, to prepare data for the subsequent citation networks and co-authorship networks. After obtaining the data, we created citation networks and co-authorship networks for each field, resulting in a total of six images, and analyzed various features of each graph. Finally, through comparing the data and images, we found that the complexity of the citation network is much higher than that of the co-authorship network. In the co-authorship network, the connection between the field of biology and AI is relatively independent, while chemistry and geology are more closely linked. In the citation network, geology exhibits two relatively independent parts, whereas biology and chemistry are more closely connected. This indicates that the application of biology to AI is multifaceted and independent, while geology has two major directions in its application to AI. Therefore, we can conclude that collaborators in biology have diverse research styles in their approach to AI, resulting in a more comprehensive application of AI.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a novel technology with profound implications for education and deep learning, particularly due to its advancements in image generation. This progress has had a disruptive impact on the design industry, where designers are increasingly embracing generative AI images as innovative tools and techniques to enhance design ideation and creative expression. Integrating generative AI images into design education has become an inevitable trend, as it guides students in developing a deeper understanding of design aesthetics. However, the current application of generative AI images in design education lacks innovative use grounded in design theory. Therefore, the incorporation of generative AI images within the framework of design theory becomes crucial to interpret and refine design processes and design thinking. This research aims to explore the application of generative AI images in design semiotics, utilizing design theory as its foundation. By integrating design processes and incorporating design case studies, the study seeks to analyze how generative AI images can be effectively applied in design semiotics. Ultimately, the research strives to establish a pedagogical approach for the application of generative AI image-based design semiotics.},

In this paper, we will explore the application areas of AI in cultural industry supply chain management, analyse the benefits and challenges it brings, and look forward to the future development trend of the integration of AI and supply chain. Traditional supply chain management methods often require a large amount of manpower to manage and monitor due to the lack of intelligence and automation. This not only increases the operating costs for the development of cultural and creative industries, but also may adversely affect the development of cultural industries due to poor information transmission and errors caused by human factors. With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, these problems are gradually being solved. Through the application of artificial intelligence technology, the intelligence and automation of supply chain management can be realised, and the reliance on human resources can be reduced. The application of artificial intelligence technology in supply chain management has great potential. It can effectively solve the problems of traditional management methods and improve the competitiveness and operational efficiency of cultural industry development. Therefore, more and more cultural industries have begun to pay attention to and try to apply AI to supply chain management in order to achieve more efficient and smarter operations.},

  abstract = {This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past. The book also teaches a careful and consistent method that enables the reader to do this kind of work as the need arises. The book suggests the need will arise.” - John Leslie King, Emeritus Professor, University of Michigan},

  abstract = {In recent years, various dense retrieval methods have been developed to improve the performance of search engines with a vectorized index. However, these approaches require a large pre-computed index and have a limited capacity to memorize all semantics in a document within a single vector. To address these issues, researchers have explored end-to-end generative retrieval models that use a seq-to-seq generative model to directly return identifiers of relevant documents. Although these models have been effective, they are often trained with the MLE method. It only encourages the model to assign a high probability to the relevant document identifier, ignoring the relevance comparisons of other documents. This may lead to performance degradation in ranking tasks, where the core is to compare the relevance between documents. To address this issue, we propose a ranking-oriented generative retrieval model that incorporates relevance signals to better estimate the relative relevance of different documents in ranking tasks. Based upon the analysis of the optimization objectives of dense retrieval and generative retrieval, we propose utilizing dense retrieval to provide relevance feedback for generative retrieval. Under an alternate training framework, the generative retrieval model gradually acquires higher-quality ranking signals to optimize the model. Experimental results show that our approach increasing Recall@1 by 12.9\% with respect to the baselines on MS MARCO dataset.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are gaining popularity as they seamlessly integrate into end-user devices, enhancing the quality of life. In recent years, there has been a growing focus on designing Smart Eye-Wear (SEW) that can optimize user experiences based on specific usage domains. However, SEWs face limitations in computational capacity and battery life. This paper investigates SEW and proposes an algorithm to minimize energy consumption and 5G connection costs while ensuring high Quality-of-Experience. To achieve this, a management software, based on Q-learning, offloads some Deep Neural Network (DNN) computations to the user's smartphone and/or the cloud, leveraging the possibility to partition the DNNs. Performance evaluation considers variability in 5G and WiFi bandwidth as well as in the cloud latency. Results indicate execution time violations below 14\%, demonstrating that the approach is promising for efficient resource allocation and user satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Generative AI has the potential to scale a number of educational practices, previously limited by resources. One such instructional approach is mastery learning, a pedagogy emphasizing proficiency before progression that is highly resource (teacher time, materials) intensive. The rise of computer-based instruction offered partial solutions, tailoring student progression and automating some facets of the mastery learning process. This work in progress considers the application of large language models for content generation tailored to mastery learning. We present a paired framework for analyzing and evaluating the generated content relative to rubrics designed by the teacher. Recognizing the potential of large language models, we critically assess the potential of improving mastery-based instruction. We close our discussion by considering the applications and limitations of this approach.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in font generation models include GANs, diffusion models, and transformers. This study introduces a GAN-based model, zi2zi self-attention, which enhances the zi2zi model by incorporating Residual Blocks (ResNet Block) and Self-Attention Layers in the encoder and decoder. These enhancements improve the ability to capture complex font details, mimicking the writer’s style while preserving the source image’s content. The study also introduces Perceptual Loss, using high-level features from the VGG-19 network to improve visual consistency and quality. The Adam optimizer with appropriate learning rates and Beta parameters is employed to enhance convergence speed and stability. For comparison, four other mainstream models are evaluated: MX-Font, CF-Font, SDT, and Font-Diffuser. These models differ from zi2zi in their focus on extracting content characters and writing style features rather than solely using adversarial networks. Experimental results show the potential and effectiveness of zi2zi-Self-Attention in generating high-quality, visually appealing handwritten fonts.},

  abstract = {Crowd counting in dense scenes is a crucial task in the field of computer vision that aims to estimate crowd statistics by predicting the location of heads. However, the accuracy of detection algorithms usually depends on manual precision labeling of a vast amount of data, which is less feasible in practical scene applications due to its high labeling cost. Moreover, the manual labeling process is prone to errors such as false labeling and missing labeling due to overlapping and small targets in the image. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a pseudo label generation algorithm based on semi-supervised learning for dense crowd datasets. The proposed algorithm employs the self-training method of target detection in semi-supervised learning to generate pseudo-labels offline. Furthermore, the algorithm uses existing point labels in dense crowd datasets to correct the positioning information, which significantly reduces the high labeling cost. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on three widely used benchmarks, ShanghaiTech, NWPU-Crowd, and UCF-QNRF, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

The attention mechanism combines channel attention and spatial attention, which helps to the proposed model effectively select sample points with high signal-to-noise ratio in the traces and assign weights, and then the feature extraction ability of the proposed model is improved. Furthermore, the densely connected convolutional network makes the enhanced features clearer and transmission of gradients more effective through dense connections, which would improve the training effect of the model. The tested results on four public data sets of the AES algorithm show that, compared with the existing deep learning side-channel attack models, the attention mechanism can effectively improve the feature extraction ability of the proposed model, so that the model have more adaptable to different datasets, then the number of traces needed to complete key recovery is reduced.},

The Curve-25519 algorithm, protected by the security features of elliptical curve algorithms and constant-time operations, presents a challenge for low-cost, non-invasive SCA methods due to its robustness. This work focuses on the leakage of conditional judgment operations that occur before each point addition and point doubling operation. By identifying these information leakage points through SCA, electromagnetic radiation and power consumption information are collected and labeled. We conduct a dataset and transformed 1-dimensional signals into a 2D image for training. The trained model is subsequently used for testing. Experiments demonstrate that this method can effectively analyze leakage points in the Curve-25519 algorithm and help to improve the robustness of the algorithm.},

Intelligent processing of ancient texts, as an essential part of digital humanities, is also undergoing a transformation in research methodologies in the wave of AIGC. The integration of generative pre-trained models with Chinese ancient texts, a vital carrier of Chinese culture, allows for deep mining of the content of these texts and provides services that make ancient texts more understandable and accessible to the general public. In this research, we propose a method that combines the most renowned Chinese anthology, the “Siku Quanshu,” with generative pre-trained models. We developed the SikuGPT model, a generative model for ancient text processing tasks, based on GPT-type language models by continued pretraining. This model was tested on two typical tasks of ancient text processing: translation between classical and modern Chinese, and classification of ancient texts. The findings reveal that our model achieves advantages in understanding and generating scenarios of ancient texts. The capability of SikuGPT in processing traditional Chinese texts helps to promote the organization of ancient information and knowledge services, and advances the international dissemination of traditional Chinese culture.},

Nowadays, soccer has been deeply integrated with artificial intelligence, and this paper combines artificial intelligence technology with deep learning, and for the difficult task of detecting players and soccer, firstly, we propose to use the deep learning-based image segmentation technology Mask R-CNN, and optimize the related computation by using residual network + feature pyramid network + RoI Align, and using binary cross-entropy loss function to predict the Pixel category not only highlights the boundaries of the image compared to traditional target detection methods, but also achieves pixel-level segmentation of each detection target, and achieves more accurate detection of players and soccer balls. Based on this, another algorithm optimized YOLOv3 is proposed for the lack of speed of Mask R-CNN, which employs a more efficient feature extraction network - -GhostNet and choosing a more appropriate a priori frame size and number and proposing the CIoU loss function for calculating the loss value of target localization to achieve a more efficient and lightweight detection of targets. Finally, for the simulated match, with the clubs, players, and soccer balls of both sides of the match as the detection targets, the data such as passes, shots, players' activity ranges, and other specific tasks are visualized and analyzed at the macro, meso, and micro levels.},

  abstract = {Usually, a soil profile ruler is located vertically on a soil profile, which is an important reference for horizontal and vertical correction of soil profile images. So, it will be detected with an improved YOLOv5 to raise its accuracy. Firstly, training samples will be expanded to solve the problem that soil profile images are less. Then to boost the detection accuracy and enhance generalization ability of the model, this paper adopts transfer learning and injects Channel Attention mechanism into YOLOv5 backbone network. Finally, the experimental sample set was used to conduct comparative experiments on soil profile ruler detection between the algorithm in this paper and other target detection algorithms to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the improved YOLOv5s model exhibits an increase of 3.7\% in precision, 1.6\% in recall, 2.1\% in mAP50, and 1.5\% in mAP50-90 compared with the original YOLOv5s model. After YOLOv5s is trained with transfer learning, the improved YOLOv5s model exhibits an increase of 2.2\% in precision, 2.9\% in recall, 0.3\% in mAP50, and 7.8\% in mAP50-90. compared with YOLOv3 -tiny, YOLOv5m, YOLOv6 and YOLOv8s of the YOLO series, the algorithm in this paper demonstrates better accuracy, recall and mAP50. The above experimental results confirm that the algorithm proposed in this paper is effective and can accurately detect the soil profile ruler in the image.},

  abstract = {In the past years, a growing number of highly-automated systems has build on Artificial-Intelligence (AI) capabilities, for example, self-driving vehicles or predictive health-state diagnoses. As for any software system, there is a risk that misbehavior occurs (e.g., system failure due to bugs) or that malicious actors aim to misuse the system (e.g., generating attack scripts), which can lead to safety and security incidents. While software safety and security incidents have been studied in the past, we are not aware of research focusing on the specifics of AI incidents. With this paper, we aim to shed light on this gap through a case survey of 240 incidents that we elicited from four datasets comprising safety and security incidents involving AI from 2014 to 2023. Using manual data analyses and automated topic modeling, we derived relevant topics as well as the major issues and contexts in which the incidents occurred. We find that the topic of AI incidents is, not surprisingly, becoming more and more relevant, particularly in the contexts of autonomous driving and process-automation robotics. Regarding security and its intersection with safety, most incidents connect to generative AI (i.e., large-language models, deep fakes) and computer-vision systems (i.e., facial recognition). This emphasizes the importance of security to also ensure safety in the context of AI systems, with our results further revealing a high number of serious consequences (system compromise, human injuries) and major violations of confidentiality, integrity, availability, as well as authorization. We hope to support practitioners and researchers in understanding major safety and security issues to support the development of more secure, safe, and trustworthy AI systems.},

  abstract = {Policy mandates in addressing climate change are hindered by a lack of intrinsic motivation amongst participants to take collective action. Instead of overt persuasion, this study applied generative AI tools to speculative imagining of future climate scenarios and their adaptation strategies, using a workshop to encourage participants to align themselves with climate action. Participants used text-to-image tools to generate visions of the future in speculative scenarios, then prompted ChatGPT for potential solutions in these scenarios. They then asked text-to-image again to visualize the ChatGPT suggestions. Participants encountered difficulties editing or removing visual elements, dealt with the lack of transparency in the generation process by specifying the physical layout as opposed to the semantics, and collaboratively developed linguistic strategies for visual depiction of novel artifacts. This work shows how generative tools can be used to prototype future scenarios and envision designs that serve social purposes.},

  abstract = {In the digital age of the 21st century, with the widespread use of Web applications, SQL injection attacks have become one of the significant challenges in the field of information security. This study proposes a method for detecting SQL injection attacks based on an improved Text-CNN model. The method starts with the preprocessing of collected SQL injection attack data, followed by the use of the convolutional layers of the Text-CNN model to extract local features, and then combines the CAM attention mechanism to achieve the task of SQL injection detection. The introduction of the CAM attention mechanism aims to merge the information from max pooling and average pooling to reduce information loss and enhance the global representation capability of the model. Experimental results show that the proposed method has improved in terms of accuracy, precision, recall rate, and F1 score, with values of 92.40\%, 92.45\%, 92.29\%, and 0.9237, respectively. Given that traditional Text-CNN, Text-RNN, and CNN algorithms can perform well in recognizing SQL injection attacks, this provides help for subsequent applications in network security protection.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence tools (Generative AI), such as ChatGPT, allow users to interact with them in intuitive ways (e.g., conversational) and receive (mostly) good-quality answers. In education, such systems can support students’ learning objectives by providing accessible explanations and examples even when students pose vague queries. But, they also encourage undesired help-seeking behaviors, such as by providing solutions to the students’ homework. Therefore, it is important to better understand how students approach such tools and the potential issues such approaches might present for the learners.In this paper, we present a case study for understanding student-AI collaboration to solve programming tasks in the CS1 introductory programming course. To this end, we recruited a gender-balanced majority non-white set of 15 CS1 students at the University of Houston, a large public university in the US. We observed them solving programming tasks. We used a mixed-method approach to study their interactions as they tackled Python programming tasks, focusing on when and why they used ChatGPT for problem-solving. We analyze and classify the questions submitted by the 15 participants to ChatGPT. Additionally, we analyzed user interaction patterns, their reactions to ChatGPT’s responses, and the potential impacts of Generative AI on their perception of self-efficacy.Our results suggest that, in about a third of the cases, the student attempted to complete the task by submitting the full description of the tasks to ChatGPT without making any effort on their own. We also observed that few students verified their solutions. We discuss the potential implications of these results.},

  abstract = {Recent studies revealed an overwhelming concern about the misuse of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools by students in completing academic requirements. The detection of AI-generated content using the naked eye was perceived to be difficult, hence the need for more accurate, reliable, and effective detection methods. As a countermeasure, educators are turning to AI content detectors and plagiarism checkers to ascertain the originality of submitted school requirements, raising concerns from students regarding the accuracy and reliability of these tools and the ethical implications and negative consequences of misclassification of genuinely original works as machine-generated outputs. By employing a holistic case study approach, the authors attempted to determine the perceptions of selected university students on the use of AI detection systems by faculty members in checking the originality and novelty of their academic outputs. Through the lenses of various normative ethical theories, the authors also analyzed the ethical issues and concerns raised by selected students to better understand their sentiments and the factors they believe could influence the faculty members' intention to adopt this emerging technology. The results of the study revealed that students have mixed attitudes and perceptions toward the faculty's intention to use AI detectors. While students perceived it as a means to encourage independent learning and critical thinking, they also expressed valid concerns regarding fairness, accuracy, and reliability, the impact on teacher-student trust, and the responsible use of the technology, among others. The participants also acknowledged the influence of other faculty members and the students' increasing dependence on AI as possible enablers of technology adoption while technological limitations, the teachers’ lack of technological skills, and age as perceived barriers. From an ethical view, the findings of the study highlighted the importance of transparency, fairness, privacy, and the need for a policy to regulate AI use.},

  abstract = {In general, grammar polishing systems recombine words and their order of combination based on the comparison results of word combinations and large vocabulary grammar data to achieve error polishing. However, this process is limited by the storage capacity of the large vocabulary grammar, which hampers the effectiveness and efficiency of error polishing. To overcome this constraint, deep learning algorithms are employed. These algorithms involve reconstructing the underlying hardware framework and optimizing the error polishing calculation parameters of the system software using deep learning algorithms. This allows for global replacement of deep learning algorithms, enhances the system's self-learning ability for error polishing, and frees it from the limitations of large vocabulary grammar information. The test results demonstrate that the continuous error polishing ability of this approach is superior. Among the error polishing systems tested, the designed system exhibits the best overall stress test performance, showcasing strong stability and control. The overall stability demonstrated by the stress test aligns with the standards and requirements of practical applications. As a result, the design system possesses good overall error polishing ability, system stability, and practical applicability.},

However, there are also concerns about accuracy and trustworthiness of self-care advice provided via AI. This paper reports our findings from workshops, diaries, and interviews with five researchers and 24 participants to explore their experiences and use of generative AI for self-care. We analyze our findings to present a framework for the use of generative AI to support five types of self-care, – advice seeking, mentorship, resource creation, social simulation, and therapeutic self-expression – mapped across two dimensions – expertise and modality. We discuss how these practices shift the role of technologies for self-care from merely offering information to offering personalized advice and supporting creativity for reflection, and we offer suggestions for using the framework to investigate new self-care designs.},

StyleSpeech incorporates a Style Decorator structure that enables deep learning models to learn style and phoneme features simultaneously. It improves adaptability and efficiency through the principles of Lower Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA allows efficient adaptation of style features in pre-trained models. Additionally, we introduce a novel automatic evaluation metric, the LLM-Guided Mean Opinion Score (LLM-MOS), which employs large language models to offer an objective and robust protocol for automatically assessing TTS system performance. Extensive testing on benchmark datasets shows our approach markedly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods in producing natural, accurate, and high-quality speech. These advancements not only push the boundaries of current TTS system capabilities, but also facilitate the application of TTS system in more dynamic and specialized, such as interactive virtual assistants, adaptive audiobooks, and customized voice for gaming.

In collaborative design, sketches play a pivotal role as a means of expressing design creativity. However, designers often tend to not openly share these meticulously crafted sketches. This phenomenon of data island in the design area hinders its digital transformation under the third wave of AI. In this paper, we introduce a Federated Generative Artificial Intelligence Clothing system, namely StyleWe, employing federated learning to aid in sketch design. StyleWe is committed to establishing an ecosystem wherein designers can exchange sketch styles among themselves. Through StyleWe, designers can generate sketches that incorporate various designers' styles from their peers, drawing inspiration from collaboration without the need for data disclosure or upload. Extensive performance evaluations and user studies indicate that our StyleWe system can produce multi-styled sketches of comparable quality to human-designed ones while significantly enhancing efficiency compared to hand-drawn sketches.},

Addressing their needs involves tackling the intricacies of caregiving and managing emotional burdens. Chatbots can serve as a viable support mechanism in regions with limited resources. This study delves into the perceptions of dementia caregivers in Peru regarding a chatbot tailored to offer care navigation and emotional support. We divided the study into three phases: the initial stage encompassed engaging stakeholders to define design requirements for the chatbot; the second stage focused on the creation of ‘Ana’, a chatbot for dementia caregivers; and the final stage assessed the chatbot through interviews and a caregiver satisfaction survey. ‘Ana’ was tested in two configurations - one employed pre-defined conversation patterns, while the other harnessed generative AI for more dynamic responses. The findings reveal that caregivers seek immediate access to information on handling behavioural symptoms and a platform for emotional release. Moreover, participants preferred the generative AI alternative of Ana, as it was perceived to be more empathic and human-like. The participants valued the generative approach despite knowing the potential risk of receiving inaccurate information.},

  abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have seen significant research interest over the past decade, yet core issues of training instability and mode collapse persist. This work proposes SwarmGAN, a novel GAN framework incorporating swarm intelligence to address these limitations. Specifically, swarm intelligence exhibits properties well-suited to enhance GAN training: emergent complex behaviors arising from simple individual agents, decentralized adaptability to instantaneous data and hyperparameters, and robustness through simple iterative interactions. SwarmGAN incorporates a particle swarm optimization algorithm to guide generator and discriminator updates. Convolutional neural network architectures and gradient penalties further ensure baseline generation quality and diversity. Extensive experiments over diverse image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SwarmGAN. Quantitative evaluations using Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance, Inception Score, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, and Structural Similarity Index Score validate performance improvements across stability, sample quality, and convergence speed. The proposed integration of swarm intelligence into adversarial networks shows promising capability to address long-standing GAN challenges.},

  abstract = {Search is far from being a solved problem. While search engines may cope well with simple tasks, searchers and systems struggle as task complexity increases. Task is central to the search process, motivating the search and driving search behavior. Complex search tasks require more than support for rudimentary fact finding or re-finding. Various support options have been offered by search systems over time (e.g., query suggestions, contextual search) to help search engine users more effectively tackle complex tasks. The recent emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and the arrival of assistive agents, or copilots, based on this technology, has the potential to offer further assistance to searchers, especially those engaged in complex tasks. The implications from these advances for the design of intelligent systems and for the future of search itself are significant. This overview of the keynote that I gave at the 2023 ACM SIGIR Conference introduces AI copilots and briefly presents some of the challenges and opportunities for researching, developing, and deploying search copilots.Date: 26 July 2023.},

In particular, interactive narratives have proven to be effective scaffolds for learning, and learnersourcing has emerged as a promising student-driven approach to enable personalized education and quality control at-scale. We introduce the first synthesis of these ideas in the context of teaching artificial intelligence (AI), which is now seen as a critical component of 21st-century education. Specifically, we explore the design of a narrative-based learnersourcing platform where engagement is centered around a learner-made choose-your-own-adventure story. In grounding our approach, we draw from pedagogical literature, digital storytelling, and recent work on learnersourcing. We report on our iterative, learner-centered design process as well as our study findings that demonstrate the platform’s positive effects on knowledge gains, interest in AI concepts, and the overall user experience of narrative-based learnersourcing technology.},

  abstract = {In Summer 2023, we developed and integrated a suite of AI-based software tools into CS50 at Harvard University. These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course's own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had "a personal tutor.'' Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues. In this paper, we detail how AI tools have augmented teaching and learning in CS50, specifically in explaining code snippets, improving code style, and accurately responding to curricular and administrative queries on the course's discussion forum. Additionally, we present our methodological approach, implementation details, and guidance for those considering using these tools or AI generally in education.},

  abstract = {Refactoring presents a complex computational challenge, and its learning is intricate, requiring a solid foundation in computational thinking, programming and object-oriented concepts. Moreover, making students realize the importance and benefits of refactoring is also challenging. To address this complexity, we introduce a refactoring teaching method based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), incorporating single-loop and double-loop learning principles, focusing on fostering deeper and critical learning. We used ChatGPT, a GAI-based tool, and conducted an eight-week mixed-methods study involving 23 computer science undergraduate students. The study involved applying four distinct projects extracted from GitHub, where participants were tasked with identifying code smells and performing the necessary refactoring to improve code quality. The primary focus was on identifying both the positive and negative aspects of the method, as well as delineating the computational thinking characteristics developed during the process. The results indicate that the use of ChatGPT facilitated the learning of refactoring, contributing to the development of numerous computational thinking skills, especially problem formulation, decomposition, and abstraction. Thus, this paper contributes a GAI-based teaching method along with evidence on how it helps students develop refactoring skills.},

  abstract = {This work questions AI´s role in bureaucratic decision-making. The Weberian conception of bureaucracy, based around the concept of an ideal bureaucracy in which authority is distributed, delegated, clearly delimited and hierarchical and that enshrines the following of formal rules, task specialization through division of labor, legal certainty and a predilection for efficiency in recordable and accountable decisions can serve as a framework to orient how governments should approach the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) given the many problems associated with its careless deployment. Using theoretical analysis, this work explains Weberian ideas of bureaucracy and contrasts them with real-life cases of implementation of AI in bureaucratic decision-making, often with detrimental results for society. After identifying and framing issues related to AI, e.g., lack of transparency, attempts to shift accountability from humans to technology, the exacerbation of bias and potential for systemic discrimination, the paper proposes Weberian prescriptions that should help public administration make careful decisions about the adoption of AI and the consequences of its implementation. The article also engages with Weber critically, rejecting the notion that public administrators do not engage in politics and asserting that AI decision-making is necessarily political as well, as it entails exercising power over citizens.},

The analysis emphasizes five dimensions of the models' capabilities in handling text data: convenience, lexical statistical abilities, core topic extraction, sentiment analysis, and code generation support. Results indicate that GPT-4 excels in core topic extraction and programming assistance but falls short in convenience for file uploads and sentiment quantification. GLM-4 shows strong performance in sentiment analysis quantification but has limitations in text analysis, code generation, and overall balance. Qwen2.5 demonstrates robust capabilities in text understanding and sentiment classification, highlighting its practicality in processing Chinese text.

This paper introduces the improved YOLO8 algorithm to practice face detection accurately to complete class attendance. First, the global attention mechanism GcNet model is introduced into the algorithm to help the model focus on key information better. The performance of the model is optimized. Secondly, the loss function adopts WIoU method to enhance the detection ability of small faces. Finally, the improved target detection head realizes the detection of small faces. Experimental result show that the improved YOLO8 algorithm can improve mAP50 by about 6\% compared with the unchanged YOLO8 algorithm. This mode can also be used for face recognition, which proves the practicability of this model.},

Next to common plagiarism, this is another reason why proving one’s authorship becomes increasingly important. One way to support this proof is to document the work process in a certified artifact. Blockchain technology lends itself to this by generation of a data structure that is intrinsically unchangeable and via strong asymmetric cryptographic algorithms tied to the creator. In this paper, we present a concept to record and validate one’s creative work. To demonstrate its feasibility, we provide a proof of concept implementation that documents and encodes a sculpting process conducted in the open-source modeling software Blender.},

At the same time, with the change of the subject of collaborative problem solving, the cultivation of collaborative problem-solving skill urgently needs to explore a new path. In this regard, more and more studies have begun to apply conversational agents in collaborative problem-solving activities, digging deeper into the effects of time on students in conversational agents. However, there is no clear answer to the question of how conversational agents can be better integrated into a collaborative environment for all to assist people in the collaborative problem-solving process and improve performance. In this study, we constructed a conceptual model of human-computer collaboration in order to improve students' learning performance. Based on this model, we integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generative and GPT to construct a conversational agent, and the results of the study showed that the Retrieval-Augmented Generative Agent for Collaborative Problem Solving constructed in this study can effectively promote students' collaborative problem-solving performance.},

This paper focuses on the role and advantages of edge computing in 5G communication, the application of artificial intelligence combined with edge computing in 5G communication, and the realization of edge AI technology architecture. Finally, two sets of simulation results are as follows: The average accuracy error of the optimized edge AI model and cloud AI model is less than 1\%, and the average response time is reduced by 31.9ms.

  abstract = {AI-pair programming is a novel approach to software development that involves a human developer and an AI assistant working together on the same code. AI-pair programming aims to improve the productivity, quality, and creativity of software development by leveraging the complementary strengths of human and AI agents. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on its impact on code quality and developer satisfaction. In this paper, we conduct a case study of TiMi studio, a leading mobile game development studio group that has been using AI-pair programming tools since 2023, and has produced several popular and high-quality games. We collect and analyze data from code repositories, code reviews, developer surveys, and developer interviews, to measure and compare the code quality and developer satisfaction of AI-pair and non-AI-pair projects. The results show that AI-pair programming has a positive impact on code quality and developer satisfaction, as it offers various benefits, such as time-saving, error-avoiding, skill-learning, possibility-exploring, feedback-receiving, and quality-improving. The results also reveal some challenges, such as reliability-questioning, explainability-questioning, trust-lacking, communication-lacking, autonomy-losing, and motivation-losing, which need to be addressed and overcome by improving and enhancing the AI-pair programming tools and practices. The paper provides empirical and practical evidence on the impact of AI-pair programming on code quality and developer satisfaction, and provides useful and actionable insights and guidance for developers, managers, researchers, and educators, who are interested in or involved in AI-pair programming, and who want to improve and optimize their software development process and outcomes.},

  abstract = {The implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, and academic research has generated considerable discussion and debate. Currently, AI systems attempt to address student learning by helping with obstacle alleviation that students face. With a full grasp of the technical systems involved, students ensure the optimal utilization of AI-assisted personalized learning. However, despite numerous empirical studies on its functionality and capabilities, there is a lack of understanding about AI's place in providing a personalized learning environment while assisting students, especially in the Philippines. This review aims to explore literature regarding the incorporation of AI systems for personalized learning that can be used by Senior High School (SHS) students, specifically in the Philippines. A multi-phase approach was employed, starting with a systematic literature review based on the PRISMA method, carried out in three phases to explore AI-assisted personalized learning's implementation, benefits, and challenges. Data from N=34 studies published from 2019 to 2024 were gathered and analyzed to explore the feasibility and impact of AI-assisted personalized learning. Overall findings show the positive impact of AI-assisted personalized learning, emphasizing improved learning outcomes and student motivation in various nations especially in Asia, Africa, and North America. Our findings show that AI personal learning systems, while promising, face challenges such as the need for empathetic AI systems, comprehensive teacher training, and underscores areas for further research and consideration to realize the full potential of AI personalized learning interventions.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force, driving productivity and shaping new forms of education. The future of education will be characterized by interactive learning, the blending of virtual and physical environments, and personalized learning experiences. The key to empowering science education with AI lies in creating new learning scenarios and applications, such as immersive teaching, personalized services, and comprehensive assessments. It is essential to understand the principles and objectives of talent development, emphasizing the integration of theoretical research and practical engineering. Furthermore, it is important to explore the mechanisms of the integrated development of AI and science education, as well as the scientific and technological issues involved. We briefly discuss three viewpoints. STEM education is the fundamental way to cultivate innovative talents. Science education, namely STEM education, conforms to the basic laws of historical materialism and the principle that science and technology are the primary productive forces. The purpose of STEM is to teach the fundamental methods for understanding, describing, transforming, and constructing the world. The key to empowering scientific education with AI lies in new scenarios and new applications. In the field of education, AI empowers the processes of teaching, learning, assessment, management, and services. In terms of engineering, knowledge graphs combined with LLMs represent a new key to personalized tutoring. AI+ is also creating new scenarios and applications, such as autonomous infrastructure inspection and intelligent diagnosis with micro-nano robots. The key to the integration of AI with STEM education lies in teachers. AI will empower education but cannot replace teachers. Teachers who understand how to use AI may replace those who do not, enabling a new form of intelligence that surpasses the limitations of human intelligence through human-machine collaboration.},

  abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) systems offer unprecedented opportunities for transforming professional and personal work, yet present challenges around prompting, evaluating and relying on outputs, and optimizing workflows. We argue that metacognition—the psychological ability to monitor and control one’s thoughts and behavior—offers a valuable lens to understand and design for these usability challenges. Drawing on research in psychology and cognitive science, and recent GenAI user studies, we illustrate how GenAI systems impose metacognitive demands on users, requiring a high degree of metacognitive monitoring and control. We propose these demands could be addressed by integrating metacognitive support strategies into GenAI systems, and by designing GenAI systems to reduce their metacognitive demand by targeting explainability and customizability. Metacognition offers a coherent framework for understanding the usability challenges posed by GenAI, and provides novel research and design directions to advance human-AI interaction.},

As educators, we need to understand the potential and limitations of AI in HCI education and ensure our graduating HCI students are aware of the potential and limitations of AI in HCI. In this paper, we report on the main pedagogical insights gained from the inclusion of generative AI into a 10-week undergraduate module. We designed the module to encourage student experimentation with GAI models as part of the design brief requirement and planned practical sessions and discussions. Our insights are based on replies to a survey sent out to the students after completing the module. Our key findings, for HCI educators, report on the use of AI as a persona for developing project ideas and creating resources for design, and AI as a mirror for reflecting students’ understanding of key concepts and ideas and highlighting knowledge gaps. We also discuss potential pitfalls that should be considered and the need to assess students’ literacies and assumptions of GAIs as pedagogical tools. Finally, we put forward the case for educators to take the opportunities GAI presents as an educational tool and be experimental, creative, and courageous in their practice. We end with a discussion of our findings in relation to the TPACK framework in HCI.},

  abstract = {With the recent advancement in technology, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can produce hyper-realistic multimedia content, such as audio, text, images, and videos. Although this technology has raised great concerns about its misuse and harmful applications, it holds great potential to revolutionize traditional ways of teaching and learning. The use of GenAI in education has increased markedly, however, pedagogical research on this rapidly emerging technology is yet to be studied extensively. There is an urgent need to investigate the unexamined potential of this technology. Therefore, this ongoing research will explore the potential of AI-generated pedagogical agents (PA), or avatars, in instructional videos to facilitate learning. The effects of the type of PA (AI-generated, real-life human), and voice (AI-generated, human voice) on an individual's learning outcomes, cognitive load, motivation, and attention will be studied. Findings from a pilot study provide some preliminary evidence that PA appearance influences learners’ retention and cognitive load, but not attention. The type of PA influenced learners' perception of the agent's ability to facilitate learning, its human-like qualities, and its engagement level. However, it did not affect its credibility. This ongoing work will contribute to the growing understanding of the impact of AI in education, provide evidence of the efficacy of AI-generated PAs in instructional videos for learning, and narrow the gap between human-computer interaction research and education.},

This article examines the socio-technical and legal perspectives of transparency in relation to algorithmic decision-making in public administration. We show how transparency in AI can be understood in light of the various technologies and the challenges one may encounter. Despite some first steps in that direction, there exists so far no mature standard for documenting AI models. From a legal perspective, this article examined the applicable freedom of information (FOI) regimes across different jurisdictions, with a particular focus on Denmark and other Scandinavian countries. Despite notable differences, our findings show that the FOI regimes generally only grant access to existing documents, and that access can be denied on the basis of the wide proprietary interests and internal documents exemptions. This is why we ultimately conclude that the European data-protection framework and the proposed EU AI Act — with their far-reaching duties to document the functioning of AI systems — provide promising new avenues for research and insights into transparency in AI.},

  abstract = {We propose an algorithm for road crack detection, leveraging enhancements to YOLOv7. This approach aims to overcome challenges related to the limited capacity for extracting features from irregularly shaped road crack targets and the sluggish inference speed caused by the intricate model structure. In this algorithm, YOLOv7 is used as the foundation. Firstly, the Detect module is improved to a Decoupled Head Detect module to augment the detection capacity of the model on feature maps. Then, the Head part is augmented with an ELAN-G module based on GSConv to reduce the model's parameter computation and accelerate the inference speed. Finally, Deformable Conv is employed to modify the original ELAN module into an ELAN-D module and integrate it into the Backbone part to bolster the model's capability in extracting irregular-shaped crack targets. Experimental results on the CRDDC-2020-US dataset demonstrate that the improved algorithm achieves a 10\% enhancement in detection accuracy, with the mAP(0.5) increasing from 53.7\% to 59.4\%. Furthermore, the model's parameter computation is decreased by 12\%, while the throughput in terms of the number of images processed per second during inference is boosted by 13\%. This algorithm proves to be effective for road crack detection applications.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is integrated into everyday technology, including news, education, and social media. AI has further pervaded private conversations as conversational partners, auto-completion, and response suggestions. As social media becomes young people’s main method of peer support exchange, we need to understand when and how AI can facilitate and assist in such exchanges in a beneficial, safe, and socially appropriate way. We asked 622 young people to complete an online survey and evaluate blinded human- and AI-generated responses to help-seeking messages. We found that participants preferred the AI-generated response to situations about relationships, self-expression, and physical health. However, when addressing a sensitive topic, like suicidal thoughts, young people preferred the human response. We also discuss the role of training in online peer support exchange and its implications for supporting young people’s well-being. Disclaimer: This paper includes sensitive topics, including suicide ideation. Reader discretion is advised.},

  abstract = {Manual verification has become very challenging based on the increasing volume of information shared online and the role of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Thus, AI systems are used to identify disinformation and deep fakes online. Previous research has shown that superior performance can be observed when combining AI and human expertise. Moreover, according to the EU AI Act, human oversight is inevitable when using AI systems in a domain where fundamental human rights, such as the right to free expression, might be affected. Thus, AI systems need to be transparent and offer sufficient explanations to be comprehensible. Much research has been done on integrating eXplainability (XAI) features to increase the transparency of AI systems; however, they lack human-centered evaluation. Additionally, the meaningfulness of explanations varies depending on users’ background knowledge and individual factors. Thus, this research implements a human-centered evaluation schema to evaluate different XAI features for the collaborative human-AI disinformation detection task. Hereby, objective and subjective evaluation dimensions, such as performance, perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust in the AI system, are used to evaluate different XAI features. A user study was conducted with an overall total of 433 participants, whereas 406 crowdworkers and 27 journalists participated as experts in detecting disinformation. The results show that free-text explanations contribute to improving non-expert performance but do not influence the performance of experts. The XAI features increase the perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust in the AI system, but they can also lead crowdworkers to blindly trust the AI system when its predictions are wrong.},

To unpack people’s attitude towards and experience with generative AI-powered writing assistants, in this paper, we conduct an experiment to understand whether and how much value people attach to AI assistance, and how the incorporation of AI assistance in writing workflows changes people’s writing perceptions and performance. Our results suggest that people are willing to forgo financial payments to receive writing assistance from AI, especially if AI can provide direct content generation assistance and the writing task is highly creative. Generative AI-powered assistance is found to offer benefits in increasing people’s productivity and confidence in writing. However, direct content generation assistance offered by AI also comes with risks, including decreasing people’s sense of accountability and diversity in writing. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings.},

Thanks to generative artificial intelligence, tools that once could only be used by highly qualified technical personnel are now in the hands of potentially inexperienced users, but unfortunately, the understanding of the layman is very far from the machinery behind the scenes. More than ever, it is necessary to help people develop an awareness that allows them to use these tools in an appropriate way and with the appropriate expectations. We believe this problem should be addressed by exploring ways to train thinking strategies to facilitate understanding of machine learning concepts that can be applied in daily life, not just by developing teaching tools on this or that topic.

  abstract = {We introduce ToonCrafter, a novel approach that transcends traditional correspondence-based cartoon video interpolation, paving the way for generative interpolation. Traditional methods, that implicitly assume linear motion and the absence of complicated phenomena like dis-occlusion, often struggle with the exaggerated non-linear and large motions with occlusion commonly found in cartoons, resulting in implausible or even failed interpolation results. To overcome these limitations, we explore the potential of adapting live-action video priors to better suit cartoon interpolation within a generative framework. ToonCrafter effectively addresses the challenges faced when applying live-action video motion priors to generative cartoon interpolation. First, we design a toon rectification learning strategy that seamlessly adapts live-action video priors to the cartoon domain, resolving the domain gap and content leakage issues. Next, we introduce a dual-reference-based 3D decoder to compensate for lost details due to the highly compressed latent prior spaces, ensuring the preservation of fine details in interpolation results. Finally, we design a flexible sketch encoder that empowers users with interactive control over the interpolation results. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method not only produces visually convincing and more natural dynamics, but also effectively handles dis-occlusion. The comparative evaluation demonstrates the notable superiority of our approach over existing competitors. Code and model weights are available at https://doubiiu.github.io/projects/ToonCrafter},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid shift to online and hybrid learning models, presenting unique challenges and opportunities in the educational sector. This study, conducted at Sultan Moulay Slimane University (USMS) in Morocco, explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance distance learning through the automatic generation of assessment questions from video content. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques, the research aims to address the limitations of passive video watching and promote active learning and self-regulated learning skills. The methodology encompasses the use of speech recognition to transcribe video content, summarization techniques to distill core concepts, and a Text2Text generation model for creating relevant assessment questions. The study's findings demonstrate that the AI-driven question generation system can match the quality, diversity, and relevance of human-authored questions, thereby reducing instructor workload and fostering personalization and engagement in hybrid learning contexts. This research contributes to the body of knowledge on applying AI in education, offering insights and frameworks for adopting AI-driven methodologies to improve online pedagogies, assessments, and learning experiences in the post-pandemic era.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in prompt-based generative AI has given rise to discourse surrounding the perceived ethical concerns, economic implications, and consequences for the future of cultural production. As generative imagery becomes pervasive in mainstream society, dominated primarily by emerging industry leaders, we encourage that the role of the CHI community be one of inquiry; to investigate the numerous ways in which generative AI has the potential to, and already is, augmenting human creativity. In this paper, we conducted a diffractive analysis exploring the potential role of prompt-based interfaces in artists’ creative practice. Over a two week period, seven visual artists were given access to a personalised instance of Stable Diffusion, fine-tuned on a dataset of their work. In the following diffractive analysis, we identified two dominant modes adopted by participants, AI for ideation, and AI for production. We furthermore present a number of ethical design considerations for the future development of generative AI interfaces.},

Other phases in the Software Engineering process have been less explored. In this paper, we argue that more investigation is needed on the support that GenAI can provide to the design, and operation of software systems, i.e., a number of crucial activities, beyond coding, that are necessary to successfully deliver and maintain software services. These include reasoning about architectural choices and dealing with third-party platforms.

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is fundamentally changing the ways of working and blurring the boundaries between human and machine-generated contents. While there is an increasing interest in the adoption of GAI systems, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, there are also serious concerns about the copyright of the contents—the inputs or generated as outputs by the GAI systems. Such concerns need to be identified and assessed to ensure the ethical and responsible use of GAI systems. Thus, this article aims to address the key research challenge: “how to identify and assess GAI system's copyright concerns”? In response, we propose the development of a Copyright Risk Checker (CRC) Tool. This tool has been formulated and evaluated using a recognised design science research methodology, drawing on an analysis of 10 legal cases across Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. The CRC Tool has undergone evaluation through an experimental scenario, and the results suggest that it is suitable for conducting an indicative copyright risk check of GAI systems. The outcomes of this preliminary assessment can be further examined by expert legal advisors for an in-depth analysis. The development of the CRC Tool provides a foundation for continued research and advancement in this significant area of study.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally transforming agriculture by optimizing productivity and addressing critical challenges. This study offers a comprehensive examination of AI's applications and technological advancements in agriculture. Key topics include precision agriculture, supply chain optimization, weed and pest management, crop monitoring, predictive analysis, and emerging innovations like vertical farming and fruit-picking machines. AI-driven precision agriculture utilizes data analytics to refine the application of inputs such as herbicides, fertilizers, and water, enhancing both efficiency and environmental sustainability[4]. Using advanced algorithms and data from sensors and satellites, AI facilitates precise crop monitoring and management, identifying pests, diseases, and weeds at early stages to mitigate crop losses[6]. Predictive analytics leverage AI to forecast weather patterns, crop yields, and commodity prices, empowering farmers with actionable insights for better decision-making[3]. The study further explores vertical farming, an innovative method using AI to optimize controlled environments for crop growth, and fruit-picking machines that automate harvesting, improving efficiency and addressing labor shortages[1]. Additionally, plant stress recognition technologies use AI to detect early signs of stress and disease, thereby enhancing crop resilience[5]. However, the adoption of AI in agriculture faces challenges, including high initial investment costs, increased energy consumption, and limitations in crop variety and adaptability[7]. High costs of infrastructure and energy, particularly in vertical farming, pose significant barriers. Moreover, current AI systems are often optimized for specific crops, with limited applicability to staple crops and deep-rooted vegetables. The complexity of agricultural ecosystems and the need for extensive, high-quality data further complicate the development of robust, generalized AI models[2]. Addressing these challenges requires on-going research, and collaboration among researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders. By overcoming these barriers, AI has the potential to significantly enhance agricultural productivity, and food security, paving the way for more resilient and efficient farming practices.},

This can drastically impact users and the media sector, especially given global risks of misinformation. While the currently discussed European AI Act aims at addressing these risks through Article 52’s AI transparency obligations, its interpretation and implications remain unclear. In this early work, we adopt a participatory AI approach to derive key questions based on Article 52’s disclosure obligations. We ran two workshops with researchers, designers, and engineers across disciplines (N=16), where participants deconstructed Article 52’s relevant clauses using the 5W1H framework. We contribute a set of 149 questions clustered into five themes and 18 sub-themes. We believe these can not only help inform future legal developments and interpretations of Article 52, but also provide a starting point for Human-Computer Interaction research to (re-)examine disclosure transparency from a human-centered AI lens.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems bring innovative ways of information provision and knowledge delivery. In the public sector, generative AI has the potential to decrease bureaucratic discretion in the decision-making process. Increasing reliance on this technology brings challenges of unfair treatment, colonized responses from the system, and data governance. Because of historical interaction, tribal communities are the most underrepresented in policy planning and implementation. Indigenous communities suffer from the neglect of tribal sovereignty by the U.S. federal government and limited accessibility and literacy in the digital world. Generative AI systems exacerbate these challenges with insufficient tribal input. However, the negative impact can be alleviated with digital equity and knowledge cocreation. Digital equity emphasizes the importance of tribal knowledge representation, and knowledge cocreation focuses on the collaboration between Indigenous communities and relevant actors in data governance for generative AI systems. This study proposes two research questions to discuss tribal knowledge cocreation in generative AI systems: (1) what are the biases in the system responses from the tribal perspective? (2) what are the potential resolutions for these problems? The findings from in-depth interviews with tribal members in the U.S. indicate that the insufficient articulation of tribal culture, the lack of crucial tribal historical events, and the inappropriate appellation of tribal nations are the primary drawbacks in the system responses. From the Indigenous perspective, tribal oral traditions, native publications and documents, and collaboration with tribal governments can address the problems of generative AI responses. This study contributes to the theory development of digital equity and knowledge cocreation in tribal generative AI system responses. Policy recommendations and future research agendas are included in this research.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are being applied to numerous applications from Healthcare to Cyber Security to Finance. For example, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are being applied to solve security problems such as malware analysis and insider threat detection. However, there are many challenges in applying ML algorithms for various applications. For example, (i) the ML algorithms may violate the privacy of individuals. This is because we can gather massive amounts of data and apply ML algorithms to the data to extract highly sensitive information. (ii) ML algorithms may show bias and be unfair to various segments of the population. (iii) ML algorithms themselves may be attacked possibly resulting in catastrophic errors including in cyber-physical systems such as transportation systems. Finally, (iv) the ML algorithms must be safe and not harm society. Therefore, when ML algorithms are applied to transportation systems for handling congestion, preventing accidents, and giving advice to drivers, we must ensure that they are secure, ensure privacy and fairness, as well as provide for the safe operation of the transportation systems. Other AY techniques such as Generative AI (GenAI) are also being applied not only to secure systems design but also to determine the attacks and potential solutions. This presentation is divided into two parts. First, we describe our research over the past decade on Trustworthy ML systems. These are systems that are secure as well as ensure privacy, fairness, and safety. We discuss our ensemble-based ML models for detecting attacks as well as our research on developing Adversarial Machine Learning techniques. We also discuss securing the Internet of Transportation systems that are based on traditional methods such as Extended Kalman Filters to detect cyberattacks. Second, Second, we discuss our work on Finally, we discuss the research we recently started as part of the USDOT National University Technology Center TraCR (Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency) led by Clemson University. In particular, we describe (i) the application of federated machine learning techniques for detecting attacks in transportation systems; (ii) publishing synthetic transportation data sets that preserve privacy, (iii) fairness algorithms for transportation systems, and (iv) examining how GenAI systems are being integrated with transportation systems to provide security. Our focus includes the following: · Data Privacy: We are designing a Privacy-aware Policy-based Data Management Framework for Transportation Systems. Our work involves collecting the requisite data and developing analysis tools to identify and quantify privacy risks. Existing privacy-preserving, differentially private synthetic data generation techniques, which tailor data utility for generic ML accuracy, are not well suited for specific applications. We are developing synthetic data generation tools for transportation systems applications. We will develop new ML algorithms that can leverage these datasets. · Fairness: We have developed a novel adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning algorithm, FairSAOML, which adapts to changing environments in both bias control and model precision. Our current work is focusing on adapting our framework to fairness in transportation systems. and control bias over time, especially ensuring group fairness across different protected sub-populations; identifying interesting attributes using explainable AI techniques that might help to mitigate bias and develop equitable algorithms. We have also developed a second system, FairDolce, that recognizes objects involving fairness constraints in a changing environment. We are adapting it to transportation applications. For example, pedestrian detection (whether or not the object being seen is a pedestrian) must be fair with respect to the race or gender of the individuals being detected under changing environments (e.g., rainy, cloudy sunny). Adversarial ML: Our prior work on adversarial ML models worked on traditional datasets such as network traffic data. Our current focus is on adapting our approach to AV-based sensor data. Our ML models are being applied to sensor data for object recognition and traffic management. These ML models may be attacked by the adversary. We will study various attack models and investigate ways of how interactions may occur between the model and the adversary and subsequently develop appropriate adversarial ML models that operate on the AV sensor data. · Attack Detection - Smart vehicles are often exposed to various attacks making it difficult for manufacturers to collaboratively train anomaly/attack detection models. Yet it would be ideal if all the data available across manufacturers could be used in building robust attack detection systems. To achieve this, we developed FAST-SV, which incorporates federated learning in conjunction with augmentation techniques to build a highly performant attack detection system for smart cars. Safety: Safety has been studied for cyber-physical systems and formal methods have been applied to specify safety properties and subsequently verify that the system satisfies the specifications. However, our goal is to ensure that the ML algorithms utilized by the transportation systems are safe. This would involve developing an AI Governance framework that would require transparency and explainability (among others) of the ML algorithms utilized by the transportation system.},

The focus is on computer vision technology to enhance safety, reliability, and potential road hazards [2]. Specifically, the focus of this paper is to recognize stop signs and cyber attacks using computer vision technology. We explore various methodologies while creating multiple model versions to determine what it takes to create trust worthy AI. Model Version 6, an implementation of YOLOv8, emerges as the most successful achieving a 95\% confidence level in identifying a normal stop sign while at the same time distinguishing from a cyber-attack with 85\% accuracy [3]. The study establishes a 95\% confidence threshold for normal stop signs and observes lower confidence levels as susceptible to cyber-attacks [4]. These results pave the way for further advancements in Trustworthy AI, providing valuable insights for ongoing development of ethical and reliable AI systems in real-world applications [5].},

  abstract = {Most recently, the number of students dropping out of universities or higher education institutions increased dramatically. This might be partly because of the students’ limited capability exploring their own learning paths within a certain course. The introduction of adaptive learning management systems could be a potential solution to this issue. Based on individual’s learning styles, these systems recommend customised and tailored learning paths. These learning styles are commonly identified using questionnaires and learning analytics, but both methods are prone to errors. While questionnaires potentially give superficial answers due to e.g. time constraints, Learning Analytics cannot mirror offline behaviour. This paper proposes an alternative to classify the learning style of individuals through the integration and combination of eye tracking and artificial intelligence algorithms. The eye movement data, which is collected in a study including more than 100 participants, is processed with different methodolgies such as data scaling and subsequently classified using various models ranging from Logistic Regression to Neural Network. Moreover, this experiment setting discovers the interplay between preprocessing and classification techniques based on complex eye tracking metrics in order to determine the most promising solutions for learning style identification. Ultimately, this comprehensive analysis not only enables the understanding of individuals’ subconscious processes, but could also lead to improved educational outcomes.},

However, few subjects in special schools cover AI-related topics, and it remains unclear how students with special educational needs (SEN) perceive, learn, and use AI. In this study, we documented the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) learning experience of seven students from two special schools who participated in a series of game design workshops. We analysed their learning process, usage, and perspectives of text-to-image GenAI through video analysis, questionnaire, and evaluation of design outputs. Our findings reveal the students' willingness to learn and utilise AI technology. This AI experience allows students, especially those who struggle with fine motor skills, to translate their ideas into digital images. Moreover, the text-to-image interaction enhances students' ability to convey their ideas in writing and develop their skills in conceptualisation. We also summarised significant human-AI interaction challenges, including difficulties with typing, Chinese and English spelling, and prompt writing. We conclude with recommendations for designing future inclusive human-AI interaction experiences for students with SEN in China.},

This alignment, with English as a reference, proves effective in enhancing cross-modal understanding. UniGen reduces reliance on multilingual text-image data, surpassing comparable models in multilingual multimodal benchmark IGLUE by a notable 7\%. Notably, UniGen is the first multilingual multimodal model to unify all pre-training tasks within a generative pre-training framework.},

It has been praised for its ability to generate human-like responses but has perhaps faced even more criticism over potential concerns for biased responses, misinformation, and generation of harmful or inappropriate content. Chat GPT utilizes large sources of data to curate responses to all kinds of questions. The generative AI models are designed to be objective and avoid any sort of bias in their output. However, in the age of misinformation, social media, user-generated content and the 24-hour news cycle, biased information has never been more plentiful. This paper investigates the possibility of biased responses produced by Chat GPT 4 utilizing public data from biased media sources through Support Vector Machines.

  abstract = {The advent of Artificial Intelligence-generated Content(AIGC) has revolutionized the traditional creative activities in the design field, the workflow of which includes idea generation, sketching, solution determination, low-fidelity prototype interaction, detail tuning, high-fidelity prototyping, front-end slicing, and deployment. By contrast, AIGC streamlines the process of design into idea generation, design model prompting, image dataset collection, AIGC tool use, model fine-tuning, and tool optimization. The designer's focus, the subject, and the object of attention have been changed accordingly. Traditional design activities without AIGC focus on realizing individual and team creativity; the ones with AIGC introduce AI models, algorithms, and AI-HMIs as collaborators in the creative process. The quality of the created content is no longer determined by the designer alone due to the involvement of Artificial Intelligence(AI) of in the prediction and decision-making of the created content. There is also a growing need for designers to have a self-explanatory and responsible intelligent system. This study investigates the role of explainability in four AIGC tools and its impact on creative design. It aims to assess how explainability influences user satisfaction and computer vision metrics in the context of style transfer for iOS mobile interface design. The results demonstrate the adaptations and limitations of these AIGC tools. As observed in CycleGAN, a high level of explainability involves various factors, including superior model performance, manageable datasets, extensive fine-tuning of model parameters, user-centered human-computer interaction, explainability results presentation, and input methods. This high degree of explainability leads to the highest levels of user satisfaction and computer vision evaluation. However, it has drawbacks, as it has limited control over design details.AIGC tools with a medium level of explainability, such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, rely on text-to-image cues for user interaction. They scored in the medium range for user satisfaction and computer vision evaluation. These tools rely on system scalability and functional control for explainability. In contrast, the low level of explainability of "Sense of Everything" stems from single dataset control and simple user interaction. As a result, it scored low on user satisfaction and computer vision assessments, indicating a need for more controllability and poor-quality content generation. The study also analyzes the impact of computer vision assessment metrics, where SSIM aligns more with users' subjective evaluations than VGG19. The study highlights areas for improving explainability to meet user expectations for higher performance and ease of use of AIGC tools.},

This study proposes an innovative unsupervised time series anomaly detection algorithm that is able to dynamically learn and adapt to anomalies in real-time data streams by combining reinforcement learning, spectral residual (SR), and variational encoder (VAE) techniques. We use a two-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) model and a self-attention network to build a reinforcement learning agent that is able to integrate temporal information of time series data to optimize policies. In addition, we propose a novel unsupervised reinforcement learning model by combining SR and VAE as the reward function. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the other four methods on two public datasets and one real-world dataset.},

To activate effective human-AI partnerships in writing, this paper provides a first step toward conceptualizing the notion of critical learner interaction with AI. Using both theoretical models and empirical data, our preliminary findings suggest a general lack of Deep interaction with AI during the writing process.

It emphasizes the personalization factor and proposes a model more aligned with the user's personalized needs by subdividing the driving stages and analyzing consumer needs. In terms of interaction modes, attention is paid to the integration of clicks, voice control, gestures, sliding, and other interaction methods to improve the flexibility of the user's operating experience. In terms of interface design, through elements such as colour, icons, typography, and fonts, combined with the automatic optimization of AI, personalized design is achieved to adapt better to the user's driving situation and preferences. Overall, this model aims to improve in-vehicle interactive systems' performance and user experience and provide a valuable reference for the future intelligent driving field.

  abstract = {Automated testing is crucial in software development to ensure that applications perform as intended. However, generating automated End-to-End (E2E) tests can be time-consuming and challenging, especially for junior developers. This study investigates the use of ChatGPT, a popular Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) model, as an assistant in developing automated E2E test scripts for Android apps. We present an empirical study that compares the effort required to create E2E test scripts and the resulting reliability of these tests using two treatments: manually and assisted by ChatGPT. We used Gherkin, a domain-specific language that allows non-technical practitioners to define test scenarios using a human-readable syntax. Our findings indicate that using ChatGPT significantly reduces the time required to develop automated test scripts without compromising the reliability of the scripts. Statistical analysis shows a notable reduction in development time for the ChatGPT-assisted group compared to the manual group, with a large effect size. While the reliability of the tests did not show a significant difference between the two groups, the results suggest practical benefits in terms of efficiency.},

  abstract = {Among creative professionals, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has sparked excitement over its capabilities and fear over unanticipated consequences. How does GenAI impact User Experience Design (UXD) practice, and are fears warranted? We interviewed 20 UX Designers, with diverse experience and across companies (startups to large enterprises). We probed them to characterize their practices, and sample their attitudes, concerns, and expectations. We found that experienced designers are confident in their originality, creativity, and empathic skills, and find GenAI’s role as assistive. They emphasized the unique human factors of “enjoyment” and “agency”, where humans remain the arbiters of “AI alignment’’. However, skill degradation, job replacement, and creativity exhaustion can adversely impact junior designers. We discuss implications for human-GenAI collaboration, specifically copyright and ownership, human creativity and agency, and AI literacy and access. Through the lens of responsible and participatory AI, we contribute a deeper understanding of GenAI fears and opportunities for UXD.},

  abstract = {Recent methodologies have achieved good performance in objectively summarizing important information from fact-based datasets such as Extreme Summarization and CNN Daily Mail. These methodologies involve abstractive summarization, extracting the core content from an input text and transforming it into natural sentences. Unlike fact-based documents, opinion-based documents require a thorough analysis of sentiment and understanding of the writer’s intention. However, existing models do not explicitly consider these factors. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel text summarization model that is specifically designed for opinion-based documents. Specifically, we identify the sentiment distribution of the entire document and train the summarization model to focus on major opinions that conform to the intended message while randomly masking minor opinions. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing summarization models in summarizing opinion-based documents, effectively capturing and highlighting the main opinions in the generated abstractive summaries.},

The services and the infrastructure provided by the TI4.0 are characterized by complexities due to the rapid evolution of associated technologies. This has continued to increase the attack surface and expose the industry to more cyber security risks. This article shows how the use of AI impacts CSRM in the TI4.0. Our work provides insights into the application of AI in mitigating cyber security risks.

  abstract = {To address constrained multi-objective optimization problems through evolutionary algorithms, both the constraint handling technique and the search operator are crucial. However, existing approaches often prioritize the former for identifying promising solutions, while the critical role of the latter in producing feasible solutions is frequently overlooked. This paper shifts the focus to the search operator's contribution by introducing an offspring generation technique that is guided by a model-driven approach leveraging adversarial learning. The method involves dividing the population into groups of feasible and infeasible solutions, which are then used as adversarial examples during the model's training phase. If the solution crafted by the generator is impractical, the feasible subset guides the evolution towards the feasible solution space, while the infeasible subset helps define the boundaries of the feasible space. This adversarial training technique progressively replicates the distribution of feasible regions within the decision space. By utilizing adversarial learning, this innovative method generates offspring with significant potential, thereby accelerating the convergence of the population towards the optimal feasible region.},

  abstract = {Aiming to improve communication and increase the access to available channels and tools, chatbots, or conversational agents, are being used to support people´s digital participation and foster civic engagement. However, conversational agents attend only expected cases of participation, that is, those based on e-consulting, e-decision making and e-informing. Hence, chatbots don´t concern non mapped cases of self-mobilization, besides there are problems in human-computer communication and in the transmission of information caused by digital divide that hinder peoples ‘participation. Literature review indicates that generative AI chatbot shall be used in non-expected interactions between human and conversational agents. Therefore, this paper discusses how chatbots could interact within self-mobilizations’ types of digital participation, concerning obstacles like lack of infrastructure and digital illiteracy. Using design science research, we propose the GenPart, a generative AI-chatbot model for enhancing people´s digital participation. We claim that this artifact can be used by researchers and practitioners who want to promote the integration between people, organizations, and information in digital platforms, promoting citizen participation and civic engagement.},

The technological framework employs AR for dynamic artifact interaction and in situ navigation, while VR capabilities facilitate virtual tours, broadening access for individuals with disabilities or those from distant geographies or socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Gamification transforms educational content into interactive experiences, fostering deeper engagement and learning. Moreover, aligning with the mission of museum institutions for cultural heritage preservation, a module for digital conservation and reconstruction was developed resorting to photogrammetry-based approaches. This module aims to create a virtual catalog accessible to both experts and the general public. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools automate tasks such as generating thematic quizzes for gamification and cataloging scanned artifacts. The system aims to improve the interpretative and educational potential of museum exhibits, modernizing visitor engagement while preserving the integrity of physical artifacts and spaces. Its continuous evolution aims to bridge traditional forms of cultural preservation and promotion with contemporary digital interaction techniques, leveraged from cost-effective publicly accessible edge technologies.},

  abstract = {As we advance in time, with the evolution of the computer industry and the escalating intricacy of diverse software, the demand for source code defects is also increasing.&nbsp;Traditional deep learning-based software defect detection methods perform well on synthetic defect datasets, but their performance on real software defect datasets is unsatisfactory. At the same time, pre-trained models derived from extensive data training are extensively employed in various NLP tasks and have achieved excellent results.&nbsp;Based on this background, this study introduces a software defect detection system leveraging CodeBERT and Bi-LSTM. This method first preprocesses and standardizes the C source code to minimize the impact of redundant information and reduce noise;&nbsp;Secondly, coding sequences are segmented and encoded using the CodeBERT pre-trained model, capturing the semantic features within the program's code and converting them into vectors containing code feature information and output;&nbsp;Then, the output of the received CodeBERT is processed through the Bi-LSTM network to acquire the structural composition inherent to the code and the semantic information of the positive and negative terms;&nbsp;Finally, the vectors containing source code features are classified using a fully connected network to determine whether the code segment has defects.&nbsp;To verify the impact of this approach, we used the cross-language benchmark test set CodeXGLUE proposed by Microsoft Research Institute for evaluating code tasks for validation. The results showed that this method had higher accuracy in detecting real software defect samples than other methods, indicating that the proposed method can effectively improve software defect detection capabilities.},

  abstract = {Current article analyzes the relationship between human capital improvement, artificial intelligence, and socioeconomic development. Specifically, it investigates the impact of human capital improvement, general artificial intelligence, and average IQ scores on total reserves. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between various independent variables and the dependent variable, total reserve. The data was analyzed using a multiple regression model in Stata. The results indicated that poverty and GARI were not significant predictors of total reserve. However, there was a significant negative relationship between HCI and total reserve, as well as a significant negative relationship between GAI and total reserve. Additionally, there was a marginally significant positive relationship between IQ and total reserve, and a marginally significant negative relationship between GII and total reserve. The coefficient for GDP per capita was also negative, but not statistically significant. These findings suggest that at least some of the independent variables have a significant relationship with total reserve, supporting the alternative hypothesis. Further research is needed to explore the direction and magnitude of these relationships. The analysis uses a linear robust regression model to account for potential outliers and influential observations. The results show that only HCI and GAI are statistically significant predictors of total reserves, while the relationship between IQ and total reserves is weaker. The findings suggest that policymakers should focus on improving human capital and harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence to promote socioeconomic development.},

In this paper we propose a fine-grained validation framework that is not overly reliant on any one facet of these sociotechnical systems, and that recognises their inherent modular structure: technical building blocks, user-facing explanatory artefacts and social communication protocols. While we concur that user studies are invaluable in assessing the quality and effectiveness of explanation presentation and delivery strategies from the explainees’ perspective in a particular deployment context, the underlying explanation generation mechanisms require a separate, predominantly algorithmic validation strategy that accounts for the technical and human-centred desiderata of their (numerical) outputs. Such a comprehensive sociotechnical utility-based evaluation framework could allow to systematically reason about the properties and downstream influence of different building blocks from which explainable artificial intelligence systems are composed – accounting for a diverse range of their engineering and social aspects – in view of the anticipated use case.},

  abstract = {Abstract: At present, Artificial intelligence technology is extensively applied across diverse sectors of the social economy and daily life. Firstly, this study introduces the current research status and relevant theoretical basis at home and abroad. Secondly, this study analyzes and summarizes the key problems and optimization goals that need to be solved in intelligent evolutionary game theory. Finally, this study improves the genetic algorithm by constructing models of different levels, and designs a comprehensive iterative cross-validation strategy combined with genetic operators to achieve the optimal control effect of the final performance index. The results show that by optimizing the intelligent algorithm, the bit error rate of the system is reduced from 0.001 to 1e-25, which greatly reduces the possibility of data corruption. Moreover, the packet loss rate decreases with the increase of distance. The result of a packet loss rate of 0.0001 makes the wireless signal more stable in data transmission. It can be seen that the application of intelligent algorithms not only improves the performance of the system, but also improves the reliability of data transmission. This can improve the stability of the communication system in complex environments, and provide users with better, more secure and reliable experience and convenience services.},

However, with the complexity of terms in the electric power field, the generic word-based encoding approach of natural language understanding model fails to identify those domain phrases even if they appear in the training samples. To improve the semantic accuracy of special content labeling, this paper proposes a words-phrase fusion encoding NLU model with the help of domain corpus. We pre-train a phrase-level Bert model in the electric power field which is involved during the model encoding step to accurately capture the semantics of domain terms and perceive the boundary of phrases. Additionally, continuous consistency loss of sequences is added to the model to reduce the to reduce the misclassification of individual words in the phrases. Experiment with real dataset in power QA system demonstrates that our model helps improve semantic parsing accuracy on both training and untrained items, alleviates the complete dependency of the phrase encoding model on word segmentation results.},

Co-housing communities typically have smaller personal spaces, closer neighbourly relationships, and engage in more mutually supportive sustainable practices. To understand such communities’ motivations and visions, we developed a speculative design tool that harnesses Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to facilitate the envisioning of alternative future scenarios that challenge prevailing values, beliefs, lifestyles, and ways of knowing in contemporary society. Within the context of co-housing communities, we conducted a participatory design study with participants in co-creating their future communities. This paper unpacks implications and also reflects on the co-design approach employing GenAI. Our main findings highlight that GenAI, as a catalyst for imagination, empowers individuals to create visualisations that pose questions through a plural and situated speculative discourse.},

As a mixed-abilities team, we investigated student experiences with GenAI tools by collecting survey and interview responses from 62 and 21 students with disabilities, respectively, across two universities to measure students’ use of GenAI tools and their perspectives on the impact of these tools in ways related to disability, university support, and sense of belonging. Despite concerns over potential risks of GenAI and unclear university policies, students described GenAI tools as a useful resource for personalizing learning, promoting self-care, and assisting with important self-advocacy work. Guidance demonstrating safe, acceptable uses of GenAI tools, along with clear policies and resources that acknowledge diverse student needs, were desired. We discuss implications of these tools for accessibility and inclusion in higher education.},

In research, a lot of attention has been given to concerns like academic integrity and how to integrate AI into learning and teaching. However, little is known about how these tools impact student help-seeking patterns and peer interactions. This short paper investigates GenAI tools, help-seeking preferences and the importance of peer support among first-year software engineering students (n=94). Our responses show that 50\% of the students use GenAI tools as the primary source of help-seeking, and 43\% report that using ChatGPT reduces their need to interact with peers. However, students generally recognize the importance of social interaction and peer support for their learning. We use these duality findings to extend previous recommendations for integrating generative AI in education by providing new recommendations on how educators can support help-seeking and peer support in the age of GenAI.},

  abstract = {As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly ubiquitous, it is crucial to equip users, particularly vulnerable populations like older adults (65+), with the knowledge to understand its benefits and potential risks. Older adults often face greater reservations about adopting emerging technologies and require tailored literacy support. Using a mixed methods approach, this study examines strategies for delivering GenAI literacy to older adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their Al literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data showed a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically significant. However, the qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of familiarity with generative AI, along with a strong desire to learn more. Qualitative findings also show that although Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not significantly enhance participants’ trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI. This exploratory case study highlights the challenges and opportunities in designing AI literacy education for the rapidly growing older adult population.},

  abstract = {The widespread adoption of generative AI is already impacting learning and help-seeking. While the benefits of generative AI are well-understood, recent studies have also raised concerns about increased potential for cheating and negative impacts on students' metacognition and critical thinking. However, the potential impacts on social interactions, peer learning, and classroom dynamics are not yet well understood. To investigate these aspects, we conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with undergraduate computing students across seven R1 universities in North America. Our findings suggest that help-seeking requests are now often mediated by generative AI. For example, students often redirected questions from their peers to generative AI instead of providing assistance themselves, undermining peer interaction. Students also reported feeling increasingly isolated and demotivated as the social support systems they rely on begin to break down. These findings are concerning given the important role that social interactions play in students' learning and sense of belonging.},

Our study emphasizes the layered digital, technical, rhetorical, and algorithmic literacies associated with design thinking and genAI to support theorizing privacy literacy. We introduce Design as an analytical element complementary to Woods and Wason's (2021) multi-pronged framework for analyzing Terms of Service (ToS) documents. Using a cluster of Adobe Generative AI ToS, we illustrate the necessity of including Design, which allows those invested in Communication Design (CD) and Technical and Professional Communication (TPC) to interrogate how or if design supports or undermines values related to user privacy, data ownership, and informed consent. We conclude by detailing how collective surveillance apathy regarding emergent data infrastructures signal a Post-Surveillance era in our global society and digital lives.},

  abstract = {Depression is a big public health problem around the world. Like the traditional methods of screening, clinical assessments, and self-rating scales are among the limits. These methods are based on the subjectivity of patient reports and the experience of doctors and clearly can have bias. In addition, they do not permit real-time monitoring of changes in mood. For this reason, this field of mental health is challenged with accurately and efficiently detecting probable mood changes in individuals at risk for depression. To resolve these challenges, we then propose a BERT-based sentimental analysis model adapted for depression-related text. Current methods for screening for traditional depression and established sentiment analysis models are hindered by data scarcity, data imbalance, and the problems of deriving emotional changes in a dynamic and clean manner. To leverage the strengths of BERTs in our model, we train the last layer of BERTs and then construct a classification layer tailored to the depressive emotion, which is more sensitive to the semantic information of the mood. Moreover, we also present data augmentation in its simplest form, which is the rearrangement of positive samples to increase the diversity of samples while still preserving the semantic meaning. To tackle data imbalance, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism to the BCEWithLogitsLoss function by adjusting the weight of the positive samples with data distribution. The model effectively captures the complex emotional changes by combining global and local semantic dynamic representations. In our empirical study, we analyze the open-source dataset of interview transcripts of 162 volunteers. Our model is evaluated using the experimental results, and the precision, the recall rate, and the F1 score obtained are 0.667, 0.667, and 0.667, respectively. Our model has achieved 2.62 higher in terms of precision and F1 score as compared to the existing models. The results indicate that our model provides a big benefit in identifying screened individuals at risk for depression.},

Finally, CRF is used for decoding to ensure the consistency of the results. Experiments show that the model has an F1 score of 0.8305 on the CDTier dataset and 0.9122 on the cybersecurity dataset, and exhibits strong robustness in dealing with noise and long-range dependencies.

  abstract = {With the wide deployment of deep learning models in various applications, the reliability problem of neural networks has gradually become a research hotspot. Computer systems are susceptible to single-particle effects, electromagnetic interference, and other factors in complex environments, resulting in frequent bit-flipping faults. Among them, Silent Data Corruption (SDC), as an imperceptible fault, cannot be detected by the system, which ultimately destroys the output results of neural network models. Current SDC detection techniques mainly focus on the system instruction stream level, and lack efficient methods to implement detection reinforcement at the model level. In addition, due to the black-box weight update mechanism of neural networks, traditional selective redundancy methods cannot provide a reliable explanation of which important weights to fix. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network Reinforcement Framework Based on Neural Network Interpretability (RFNI). RFNI explores the redundancy ratio of convolutional kernels by performing layer-by-layer search in convolutional neural networks through SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) agent; secondly, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated by combining with neural network interpretability algorithms; and finally, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated based on the total Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS). Second, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated by combining with the neural network interpretable algorithm; finally, the granularity configurable redundancy reinforcement is implemented based on the total floating point operations per second (FLOPS). The experimental results show that RFNI on multiple neural network architectures significantly improves the recognition accuracy in case of SDC over existing methods, and can effectively enhance the robustness of the model.},

The pipeline includes a novel Spanish language question-answer dataset, automatic question text generation, data augmentation, preprocessing using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and a Transformer model that integrates the components to quantify and provide a prediction of fluency. We found that our model is able to predict language fluency with high accuracy using the components: morphology, syntax and pragmatics with higher scores for syntax. The results of this study show the possibility of the use of AI to verify if an individual is fluent in a particular language.},

  abstract = {Starting in November 2022 with the free provision of ChatGPT, large language models (LLM) are now publicly available. This has significantly increased the number of publications that scope potential changes caused by the application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in various societal domains. The private use of AI and the economic integration of generative LLMs have increased significantly. However, for parliamentarians and parliamentary professionals, the technology often remains abstract, impacting everyday work only peripherally. Due to the special responsibility of parliaments, governments, and administrations as the organizational instances of society, and through the inherent legitimations by society itself, there is a necessity to examine the implications of the use of generative LLMs within these institutions and traditional structures as well as their influence on political system logic. The article analyzes the responses that the generative LLMs GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 have provided via ChatGPT, based on the same input command (prompt) over different times. The responses help to assess how LLMs can be used in the parliamentary context, to reflect what dangers exist as well as to respond to the question on how a business model of an AI department in parliament might look like. Furthermore, it shall be explored whether there are fluctuations in the quality of the responses and how these should be evaluated against the backdrop of the need for accurate and precise workflows in parliamentary operations. Ultimately, the article aims to provide an answer as to whether the application of ChatGPT together with the LLMs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 could already deliver this necessary quality and consistency for the parliamentarian working environment today.},

  abstract = {User behavior and experience are important for improving information retrieval (IR) systems. While much research has focused on traditional IR systems, few studies have systematically examined user behavior and search experience with emerging generative IR systems. A key reason for this gap is the lack of publicly available toolkits to record user behavior and feedback in generative IR systems. We developed a comprehensive platform to collect user behavior and feedback on the generative IR system. This platform consists of: 1) a generative IR system that supports both API-based and customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, 2) a user interface that logs various user behavior, including prompts, clicks, mouse movements, and scrolling, and 3) an annotation website that allows users to provide feedback. We believe the proposed platform has the potential to streamline data collection for user studies on generative IR systems, paving the way for future research on how users engage with and interact with these systems.},

  abstract = {Have you ever wondered how a researcher from the periphery can gain an enduring foothold in the pantheon of researchers from the center? This essay will attempt to answer that question. Halcyon Lawrence was a researcher, writer, and professor from the Global South who has made a mark on a community of technical communication scholars, writers, researchers, and professors with her widely discussed research articles dealing with the pros and cons, perils and promises, boon and bane of speech recognition tools and technology. Lawrence's research explores the thickets of speech recognition and proposes strategic and revisionary measures toward neutralizing the lopsided corpora of speech recognition software, vaporware, and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology. To crystalize her contributions to justice, data justice, and racial-linguistic justice, I chose a chapter, "Siri Discipline," she (2021) wrote for the book Your Computer is on Fire (Mullaney et al, 2021). My essay highlights how her ideas have gained more traction in relation to the current disruption of the AI revolution (Gopal, 2020). That disruption is often exemplified through ChatGPT, a platform that shows how Lawrence's core insight from "Siri Discipline" can have a direct bearing on normative frameworks being developed to address burgeoning challenges ushered in by the AI revolution.},

  abstract = {Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning, as it leverages multiple MRI modalities to provide complementary diagnostic information. However, missing modalities are frequently en- countered in clinical practice due to factors such as image degradation, artifacts, protocol inconsistencies, or patient con- traindications to contrast agents. While certain unified models are designed to accommodate various missing modality scenarios, their performance declines markedly when multiple modalities are absent, particularly in cases where only a single modality is available. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a Guided- learning Network that leverages dynamic FFT filters. This network trains multiple specialized models designed for different missing modality scenarios, achieving outstanding performance. The architecture comprises two distinct learning paths: one dedicated to capturing multimodal information and another focused on generating modality-specific representations for the missing modality. A guided-learning strategy connects these two paths. Initially, the multimodal path is trained and its parameters are locked, enabling the missing modality path to learn under its guidance. The training process incorporates several key com- ponents: adversarial learning to align high-level features across paths, frequency-domain adaptive filtering using dynamic FFT filters to extract global features, and mutual information transfer to ensure critical information is retained even when modality data is missing. Experiments conducted on the BraTS2018 dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms comparable state-of- the-art methods in all missing modality cases.},

We further propose a hybrid framework that combines language model with gradient boosted trees. Our framework achieves the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) across all prediction time horizons, achieving a 2.4\% reduction in MAE compared to baseline methods. This work provides foundational resources and methodological insights for future studies on retraction impacts, aiming to help researchers make more informed citation decisions.},

  abstract = {At present, network security becomes more and more important, but the security vulnerability data in various databases are relatively dispersed and it is difficult to establish the connection between them, network security knowledge graph can associate the security vulnerability data of different databases together, and it can be updated in real time with the latest security vulnerabilities. This paper establishes network security knowledge graph based on CAPEC, CWE and other security libraries. Aiming at the problem that TransR model cannot utilize entity semantic information, TransR-Roberta model is proposed, and splicing layer, attention layer and convolutional layer are added on the basis of TransR model. And for the problem that the quality of negative samples generated by Bernoulli negative sampling is too low, a clustering-based negative sampling optimization method is proposed. Firstly, the clustering task is accomplished with the help of Gaussian hybrid clustering algorithm on the entities in the security vulnerability knowledge graph to label the entities with clusters. In the next step, the clustered vulnerability entities are reclassified using support vector machine. Finally, a classifier combined with Facolloss function is added to the loss function of the TransR model, which is used to improve the ability of the knowledge inference model to distinguish between positive and negative samples. The experimental results show that the improved model improves the hit@N, MR and MMR metrics for the knowledge reasoning task.},

However, the existing SISR technology based on convolutional neural network (CNN) still faces great challenges in the application of resource-constrained mobile devices. For lightweight SISR, we propose a multi-level feature mixing network (MFMN), which achieves high-quality super-resolution image reconstruction at low computational cost. Based on re-parameterization, a multi-level feature generation module (MFGM) is designed to extract feature mappings from different perspectives. Then, to enhance feature details, a feature refinement module (FRM) is constructed to aggregate high-frequency information, which can assign weight values to pixels in feature maps according to the importance of different hierarchical features. Through many experiments, our proposed method shows excellent image reconstruction results in a lightweight way on multiple benchmark datasets and exceeds the current advanced methods.},

However, there are still challenges in EMR interoperability, security, and data exchange. To address these existing limitations, This study proposes a voice electronic medical record system driven by artificial intelligence and blockchain, which is designed to improve clinical records and nursing coordination. This system adopts a dedicated deep learning architecture. It transcribe the conversations between doctors and patients into text, and then uses natural language processing to extract the relevant medical information. At the same time, it also provides diagnostic prompts, which can reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Doctors can view and edit these summaries generated by artificial intelligence. Then safely record them on the decentralized crypto blockchain ledger. With federated learning, the model can be continuously improved in multiple centers without infringing on data privacy. This solution integrates automatic speech recognition, distributed ledger technology, and collaborative deep learning, aiming to enhance the EMR efficiency, security, data integrity, and care continuity of medical institutions. The combination of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence technology holds great potential. It can transform fragmented health data into portable and interoperable records under patient control, thus bringing strategic advantages to the health system that is undergoing a comprehensive digital transformation.},

  abstract = {Prompt and sufficient feedback is essential for students' academic learning since it enables them to review their learning techniques and improve their areas of weakness. Nevertheless, delivering personalised feedback to every student continues to be difficult&nbsp;for teachers due to its demanding and time-intensive nature. While automated feedback systems are available, their primary focus is providing feedback on a single subject, and most of them utilise statistical analysis or traditional machine learning techniques to provide feedback. Moreover, no feedback model utilises the same criteria to generate text-based feedback for more than one subject. Generative artificial intelligence (GEN AI) has recently made incredible progress, and large language models (LLMs) can retain the context from the vast amount of text. Hence, this research presents a framework that employs an innovative technique to offer text-based feedback to students in different fields of study. This framework employs two LLMs, one for generating the feedback and another for categorising it into separate subjects using suitable headings for structural organising. Consequently, the output produced by this technology corresponds to the original tone of the teacher.},

  abstract = {This study is the research outcome of the project "Exploration of Student-Centered Teaching Reform and AI Technology Application in Dynamic Website Design Courses" led by the author at ZhuJiang College, South China Agricultural University. This study investigates the development and application of an intelligent question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) system tailored for computer science course instruction, using the BERT model as its core framework. Traditional teaching methods face limitations in providing timely, personalized responses to students' inquiries, especially in large classroom settings. To address this, we propose a Q&amp;A system based on BERT's bidirectional training capabilities, enabling deeper contextual understanding and precise response generation. The research introduces specific advancements in system structure, model selection, dataset creation, and training processes to address the unique needs of computer science education. The methodology encompasses dataset construction, using a collection of 2,000 carefully curated question-answer pairs spanning essential topics like operating systems, programming languages, and databases. We refined the BERT model with this dataset through fine-tuning, employing dynamic masking and the Adam optimizer with a decay learning rate to achieve optimal generalization. Furthermore, we developed a user feedback mechanism, where responses are evaluated for accuracy, enabling continuous model refinement and adaptation to student feedback. This study designed an MVC-based system integrating Java, TorchServe, and MySQL. Experiments show that it outperforms traditional methods in performance and efficiency, achieving an F1 score of 91.1\% with a response time of just 0.8 seconds. Error analysis indicates room for improvement in handling complex terminology and contextual understanding. This work's innovations contribute a robust, scalable tool for enhancing computer science education, offering educators a powerful solution to improve teaching interactivity, efficiency, and personalized learning support. The insights gained from this study support broader applications of AI-driven Q&amp;A systems in academic settings, paving the way for future developments in automated educational assistance.},

However, the proliferation of generated images has also raised issues such as information distortion, which poses challenges to the protection of original content and the assurance of information authenticity. As a result, many detection methods have been proposed in recent years to identify generated images. By analysing existing AIGC detection methods, we categorise them into four groups: frequency domain features, traditional models, image reconstruction and multi-modal large models. Through comparative analysis, this paper highlights the advantages and limitations of current detection methods and outlines potential research directions for the future. Our aim is to provide valuable insights to researchers in related fields, thereby promoting the further development of AIGC detection technology and enhancing our ability to address the challenges posed by AIGC.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence extends beyond its success in image/text synthesis, proving itself a powerful uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique through its capability to sample from complex high-dimensional probability distributions. However, existing methods often require a complicated training process, which greatly hinders their applications to real-world UQ problems, especially in dynamic UQ tasks where the target probability distribution evolves rapidly with time. To alleviate this challenge, we have developed a scalable, training-free score-based diffusion model for high-dimensional sampling. We incorporate a parallel-in-time method into our diffusion model to use a large number of GPUs to solve the backward stochastic differential equation and generate new samples of the target distribution. Moreover, we also distribute the computation of the large matrix subtraction used by the training-free score estimator onto multiple GPUs available across all nodes. Compared to existing methods, our approach completely avoids training the score function, making it capable of adapting to rapid changes in the target probability distribution. We showcase the remarkable strong and weak scaling capabilities of the proposed method on the Frontier supercomputer, as well as its uncertainty reduction capability in hurricane predictions when coupled with AI-based foundation models.},

  abstract = {People often apply gender stereotypes to Artificial Intelligence (AI), and AI design frequently reinforces these stereotypes, perpetuating traditional gender ideologies in state-of-the-art technology. Despite growing interests in investigating this phenomenon, there is little conceptual clarity or consistency regarding what actually constitutes a "gender stereotype" in AI. Therefore, it is critical to provide a more comprehensive image of existing understandings and ongoing discussions of gender stereotypes of AI to guide AI design that reduces the harmful effects of these stereotypes. In doing so, this paper presents a scoping review of over 20 years of research across HCI, HRI and various social science disciplines on how gender stereotypes are applied to AI. We outline the methods and contexts of this growing body of work, develop a typology to clarify these stereotypes, highlight under-explored approaches for future research, and offer guidelines to improve rigor and consistency in this field that may inform responsible AI design in the future.},

  abstract = {The continuous development of social media in scientific communication and the arrival of the era of artificial intelligence have provided more possibilities for evaluating the influence of scholars, making evaluation algorithms no longer limited to quantitative indicators. On the basis of existing scholars' influence evaluation algorithms at home and abroad, this article designs a scholar influence evaluation approach and algorithm based on open peer review. That is, the qualitative content of open peer review in scholar articles is processed by certain artificial intelligence technology to form multiple label sets that can represent the influence of scholars from different dimensions, thus exploring the multi angle evaluation of scholar influence from a quality perspective. Finally, this article conducts empirical research and comparative analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using the open peer review platform F1000 as the data source platform. Empirical research has shown that the algorithm proposed in this article provides a new perspective and approach for evaluating the influence of scholars, which can preliminarily achieve multidimensional evaluation of scholars, endow scholars with personal academic profiles, and enhance the fullness and recognition of scholar influence. Comparative analysis shows that this algorithm does not have a significant correlation with bibliometric evaluation algorithms and can serve as a supplement to the existing evaluation system. The combination of traditional bibliometric analysis algorithms and open peer review based algorithms will be the future development trend of academic evaluation.},

The study emphasises that AI in education should be based on the essence of “educating people”, and promote the role of teachers to shift from “knowledge transfer” to “growth guidance” under the ethical framework, and synergise technological empowerment and humanistic care. The future needs to explore localised adaptation paths. In the future, it is necessary to explore the local adaptation path, not only to make use of AI to break through the bottleneck of large-scale education but also to prevent the alienation of the technology, and build an intelligent education ecology of “teaching in accordance with one's aptitude”.},

  abstract = {In the field of data privacy protection, data access is restricted by setting access privileges and authentication mechanisms. However, when data usage scenarios or access requirements change, the privilege settings need to be adjusted frequently, resulting in complex and inefficient management. Especially when dealing with large-scale distributed data, traditional methods are difficult to efficiently screen and eliminate malicious behavior clients, which further aggravates the risk of privacy leakage. Therefore, we study the optimization of data privacy protection algorithm based on distributed artificial intelligence technology. The key feature information is extracted to reflect the essential attributes of the data, in order to simplify the form of data representation. The federal learning algorithm in distributed artificial intelligence technology is used for data protection to efficiently screen and eliminate potential malicious clients. On this basis, we add appropriate amount of noise to the query process to protect the data from being leaked, and at the same time, dynamically adjust the data privacy protection algorithm and update the protection scheme in real time to cope with the changing nature of the data and its intrinsic relevance. The experimental results show that the optimization method of data privacy protection algorithm based on distributed artificial intelligence technology is significantly better than other comparative methods in reducing the possibility of privacy leakage, improving privacy protection efficiency, and reducing data loss rate. Moreover, the security and reliability of privacy data is as high as 90\%, fully verifying the superiority of the proposed method. The results indicate that this method provides an efficient, stable, and secure technical means for data privacy protection.},

We selected papers published since 2000 concerning the aforementioned applications, investigated the algorithms described therein, and compared their data performance in the testing sections to explore the advantages and disadvantages. Our findings reveal that SVM exhibits excellent performance in detecting attack traffic, whereas decision trees and their enhanced versions are less prominent. Additionally, genetic algorithms are not suitable for attack traffic detection but excel in filtering irrelevant traffic features. These insights hold significant implications for both real-world applications in enhancing cybersecurity measures and theoretical contributions by laying groundwork for future research in the rapidly evolving domain of DDoS attack mitigation. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive overview of the landscape of machine learning in DDoS defense, providing valuable insights and directions for future investigations.},

Through qualitative and quantitative research methods, this paper analyzes the application of AIGC technology in home textile design, revealing its role in improving design efficiency, optimizing design quality, and promoting human-machine collaboration. The study shows that AIGC technology not only redefines the mode of idea generation, but also provides new impetus for process design innovation. Based on the research results, this paper proposes a strategy to optimize the design process of home textiles, which provides theoretical support and practical guidance for the further application and design practice of AIGC technology, as well as new ideas for future research and industrial applications.},

The report of the 20th National Congress of the Party proposed the “Digital Strategy for the Cultural Industry,” emphasizing the need to drive industrial innovation through scientific and technological innovation and to develop new-quality productivity. As an important part of the cultural industry, the cultural and creative industries have extremely high economic and social value. The empowerment of digital technology not only improves the production efficiency of the cultural and creative industries but also expands their market boundaries, creating new economic growth points. Generative artificial intelligence has changed the traditional content production model and brought about a transformation in the development of cultural and creative products. This study explores the significant impact of generative artificial intelligence on the collaborative approaches, production logic, and development models of cultural and creative products, as well as how it promotes the close integration of culture and technology.},

  abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence technology, generative AI models such as GPT are now increasingly used in education. Studies have found that these models have great potential in improving students' innovation ability, especially in cultivating students' creative thinking and problem-solving abilities. However, we found that the current traditional teaching methods are still somewhat lacking in cultivating students' innovation and creativity. For example, many students are not well prepared and answer questions when facing complex real-life problems. This time, our research mainly wants to see whether the tasks designed based on GPT can effectively improve undergraduate students' creativity. At the same time, we use the support vector machine (SVM) model for quantitative evaluation. We designed four specific tasks to examine students' performance from the core dimensions of innovation, namely creative thinking, problem solving, knowledge integration, and teamwork. The experimental results show that GPT has a significant effect on improving students' creative thinking (task one) and problem solving (task two), especially in the problem-solving task. We also compared the scores predicted by the model with the actual scores and found that the two were very consistent, which shows that GPT can indeed help students better diverge their thinking and analyze problems. In addition, this study also verified the feasibility of using support vector machines to quantitatively evaluate students' innovation ability. In general, GPT combined with machine learning models such as SVM may become a valuable tool in the future in improving students' creativity, problem-solving ability, and even overall innovation performance.},

  abstract = {Facing enormous data generated at the network edge, edge intelligence (EI) emerges as the fusion of edge computing and AI, revolutionizing edge data processing and intelligent decision-making. Nonetheless, this emergent mode presents a complex array of security challenges, particularly prominent in image-centric applications due to the sheer volume of visual data and its direct connection to user privacy. These challenges include safeguarding model/image privacy and ensuring model integrity against various security threats, such as model poisoning. Essentially, those threats originate from data attacks, suggesting data protection as a promising solution. Although data protection measures are well-established in other domains, image-centric EI necessitates focused research. This survey examines the security issues inherent to image-centric EI and outlines the protection efforts, providing a comprehensive overview of the landscape. We begin by introducing EI, detailing its operational mechanics and associated security issues. We then explore the technologies facilitating security enhancement (e.g., differential privacy) and EI (e.g., compact networks and distributed learning frameworks). Next, we categorize security strategies by their application in data preparation, training, and inference, with a focus on image-based contexts. Despite these efforts on security, our investigation identifies research gaps. We also outline promising research directions to bridge these gaps, bolstering security frameworks in image-centric EI applications.},

  abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) supports early detection of learning difficulties by predicting student performance. However, machine learning models often operate as black boxes. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) helps to explain why black-box models produce specific predictions. This paper systematically reviews the past five years of research on XAI applications for interpreting student performance prediction in Computer Science and STEM education. We found that behavioral and academic performance data were the most commonly used features, with the main prediction goals focused on course failure risk or grades. This study also examined the application areas of XAI, revealing that the most common uses were global feature importance analysis, individual prediction explanations, and supporting interventions and decision-making. Moreover, we found that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were the most frequently utilized XAI technique, predominantly applied at the global level, with limited use at the individual level. Furthermore, a research gap was identified in utilizing XAI to support course improvements, customize visualizations, and generate personalized recommendations. Addressing this gap could enable educators to provide personalized, data-driven guidance to better support individual students.},

The review synthesized current research trends and key applications, with a particular focus on large language models (LLMs) and advanced chatbots. The findings revealed a significant increase in research interest following the release of ChatGPT, with most studies concentrating on university-level programming education. The review identified eight primary applications of AIGC tools in programming education, including evaluating AI performance in solving programming tasks, providing AI-driven code generation and assistance, automating assessment review and feedback, delivering personalized learning and tutoring, supporting educators and instructional design, investigating educator and student perceptions, checking for plagiarism, and exploring AI's impact on curriculum design. Despite the promising potential of these tools, critical gaps remained, particularly in primary and secondary education, as well as in online and blended learning environments. Future research was recommended to address these areas and to explore a broader range of AIGC tools to unlock their full potential for enhancing programming education.},

The development and application of mixed reality and generative AI are accelerating, evolving classroom structures and methods. In the context of rapid social, economic, and technological development, students require more personalized and innovative education, which dialogue learning interventions based on generative AI can effectively address. Through a systematic literature review method, 128 relevant studies from the past decade were systematically analyzed to explore the feasibility of dialogue learning in the context of generative AI. The study finds that the application of generative AI in dialogue learning not only enhances learning outcomes but also excels in personalized learning and timely feedback. However, the diversity and operability of technological implementation and application scenarios require further exploration.

  abstract = {Modern AI systems are man-made objects that leverage machine learning to support our lives across a myriad of contexts and applications. Despite extensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations remain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI systems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions—their metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this perspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We do so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria—formal rules that answer the questions “When are two AI systems the same?” and “When does an AI system persist, despite change?” Building on Carrara and Vermaas’ account of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness provides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of these artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical make-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their trustworthiness profiles—the collection of capabilities that the systems must uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their effectiveness in maintaining these capabilities. Our approach suggests that the identity and persistence of AI systems is sensitive to the socio-technical context of their design and utilization via their trustworthiness, providing a solid metaphysical foundation to the epistemological, ethical, and legal discussions about these artifacts.},

It is evaluated from dimensions such as publication time characteristics, author collaboration networks, and keyword clustering graphs. Systematically sort out the current research status, hot topics and development trends in this field. Research has found that in recent years, studies have focused on core areas such as higher education, integration of industry and education, and digital transformation of education. Research shows that the research direction has shifted from the application of technological tools to educational ethics and the essence of talent cultivation. Based on these findings, the study puts forward development suggestions from three dimensions. The three dimensions are respectively building a cross-disciplinary collaboration mechanism, strengthening technology-driven innovation, and enhancing the digital literacy of teachers and students. The aim is to promote the deep integration of artificial intelligence and higher education and contribute to the establishment of a new intelligent education ecosystem.},

  abstract = {University students' adoption of generative AI tools in educational contexts is investigated in this research through two complementary studies. A Jordanian-based cross-sectional study (N=95) initially established the middle students' familiarity (M=3.14, SD=0.81) with generative AI writing tools, along with significant concerns about misinformation/data security (M=3.35, SD=0.85), but high awareness regarding advantages for creativity simulation and innovation facilitation (M=3.62, SD=0.81). Second, a Chinese UTAUT-based research (N=361) employing SEM-ANN hybrid analysis found that DeepSeek adoption intention is significantly determined by Perceived Price (β=0.346), Performance Expectancy (β=0.244), Effort Expectancy (β=0.233), eXplainable AI (β=0.126), and Facilitating Conditions (β=0.084), while Social Influence did not appear to be significant (β=−0.019). Moderator analysis found gender and education level to significantly moderate some predictor-intention relationships. Synthetically, these findings demonstrate: (a) cultural consensus in recognition of AI's value for learning in various capacities despite technical challenges, (b) the critical role of cost disclosure, usability, and explainability in adoption, and (c) stratified intervention needs to address technical instruction, ethical literacy, cost reduction, and maximization of usability – particularly through personalized learning deployments. The study supports the UTAUT's efficacy for use in AI adoption studies while enriching methodology integration through SEM-ANN methods.},

  abstract = {Recently, creative generative artificial intelligence software has emerged as a pivotal assistant, enabling users to generate content and seek inspiration rapidly. Text-to-Image (T2I) software, one of the most widely used, synthesizes images with text input by engaging in a cross-modal process. However, despite substantial advancements in the T2I engine, T2I software still encounters errors when generating complex or non-realistic scenes, including omitting focal entities, low image realism, and mismatched text-image information. The cross-modal nature of T2I software complicates error detection for traditional testing methods, and the absence of test oracles further exacerbates the complexity of the testing process. To fill this gap, we propose ACTesting, an Automated Cross-modal Testing Method of Text-to-Image Software, the first testing method explicitly designed for T2I software. ACTesting utilizes the metamorphic testing principle to address the oracle problem and identifies cross-modal semantic consistency as its fundamental Metamorphic relation (MR) by employing the Entity-relationship (ER) triples. We design three kinds of mutation operators under the guidance of MR and the adaptability density constraint to construct the new input text. After generating the images based on the text, ACTesting verifies whether MR is satisfied by detecting the ER triples across two modalities to detect the errors of T2I software. In our experiments across five popular T2I software, ACTesting effectively generates error-revealing tests, resulting in a decrease in text-image consistency by up to 20\% when compared to the baseline. Additionally, an ablation study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed mutation operators. The experimental results validate that ACTesting can reliably identify errors within T2I software.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has led the AI community to speculate that artificial superintelligence (ASI) may be within reach, particularly if an AI system can iteratively search for solutions, learn from results, and leverage improved knowledge for more searches. In this context, this study explores the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into Building Information Modeling (BIM) by focusing on the four key pillars of the OpenAI o1 model and their ethical implications. Through comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we examine these pillars—policy initialization, reward design, search strategies, and learning mechanisms—and their application in BIM-GenAI within a continuous improvement cycle. Results demonstrate that policy initialization generates human-like reasoning behaviors and domain-specific knowledge for BIM tasks. Reward design, central to reinforcement learning, optimizes BIM objectives through measurable metrics and learned evaluation methods. Search strategies prove valuable for exploring complex design spaces and generating high-quality BIM solutions, while learning mechanisms, including policy gradient and behavior cloning, enable continuous model improvement through feedback. The study emphasizes the importance of establishing BIM-AI protocols, maintaining human expertise in decision-making, and balancing automation with human input. Our findings suggest that while GenAI, powered by reinforcement learning, offers significant potential for enhancing BIM capabilities, three critical ethical considerations—data privacy and security, algorithmic bias mitigation, and transparency and accountability—must guide responsible implementation. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI in construction technologies and provides a foundation for the ethical advancement of BIM-GenAI systems using OpenAI o1.},

  abstract = {Inter-generational communication plays a vital role in bridging generational gaps and fostering mutual understanding. However, it remains challenging due to differences in cultural norms, communication styles, and geographical separation. While prior studies have shown Virtual Reality (VR) as a medium that fosters a relaxed atmosphere and companionship, its capacity to address the nuanced dynamics of inter-generational dialogue, such as divergent values and relational intricacies, remains limited. To address this gap, we explored the opportunities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support inter-generational communication in VR. We developed three technology probes (e.g., Content Generator, Communication Facilitator, and Info Assistant) in VR and employed them in a probe-based participatory design study with twelve inter-generational pairs. Our results show that AI-powered VR facilitates inter-generational communication by enhancing mutual understanding, fostering conversation fluency, and promoting active participation. We also introduce several challenges when using AI-powered VR in supporting inter-generational communication and derive design implications for future VR platforms, aiming to improve inter-generational communication.},

  abstract = {The integration of generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) into everyday life raises questions about the competencies required to critically engage with these technologies. Unlike visual errors in genAI, textual mistakes are often harder to detect and require specific domain knowledge. Furthermore, AI’s authoritative tone and structured responses can create an illusion of correctness, leading to overtrust, especially among children. To address this, we developed AI Puzzlers, an interactive system based on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), to help children identify and analyze errors in genAI. Drawing on Mayer \&amp; Moreno’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, AI Puzzlers uses visual and verbal elements to reduce cognitive overload and support error detection. Based on two participatory design sessions with 21 children (ages 6 - 11), our findings provide both design insights and an empirical understanding of how children identify errors in genAI reasoning, develop strategies for navigating these errors, and evaluate AI outputs.},

While previous research has explored the pedagogical applications of GenAI and the challenges faced by educators and students, there is less focus on GenAI in the context of a design education. We present findings from group interviews and a survey study conducted with interaction design bachelor students, foregrounding the attitudes and perspectives of students who are motivated to learn. We show that although students are generally aware of ethical issues surrounding GenAI, they make considered decisions on how they use it to support their learning. An insight is how the students’ pride in their own learning and accomplishment guides their use more than moralistic and disciplinary rhetoric widespread in the higher education sector. The paper concludes with thought-provoking questions to guide future steps. The insights presented may inform curriculum development and suggest future research directions on the role of AI-assisted learning in HCI education.},

  abstract = {The rising levels of stress and anxiety among university students have become increasingly alarming, largely driven by academic pressures, social expectations, and the transition to adulthood. These challenges often result in a decline in mental well-being, necessitating innovative solutions to help ease the burden. This paper presents the design and development process of Purry, a social robot inspired by cat behaviors, created to provide stress relief for university students. Purry was designed to offer emotional comfort in a unique way, harnessing the calming effects of pet-like interactions. The design process focused on achieving both aesthetic appeal and functional efficiency, combining modern and traditional technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and low-cost materials, following the double diamond methodology. The robot mimics feline behaviors like kneading and purring, exploring both active and passive tactile interactions, which have been shown to reduce stress through sensory stimulation. Iterative development cycles, guided by user feedback, led to significant advancements in balancing form and function. The final result is a robotic experience that combines emotional support with innovative design, offering a product that not only addresses students' mental health needs but also fosters an engaging and comforting presence in their environment.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is integrated with various domains for design education — expanding creativity, problem-solving, design methodologies, research, etc. due to its ability to simulate human cognition and behavior. Using systematic review and content analysis, this study conducts a systematic review to understand the AI-powered curriculum innovation trends in design education. From the analyzed papers, five emerging themes were identified: (1) Art and Design Education, (2) Visual Communication and Graphic Design, (3) Integration and Innovation of AI in Design Education, (4) Design Thinking and AI for Education, and (5) Generative AI for Design and Fashion. The results suggest that AI has evolved from a foundational technical tool to a transformative force changing how we learn, update curricula, and assess knowledge. Although AI is a game changer in terms of efficiency and finding different creative paths, the ethics and influence on the design process will have to be examined thoroughly. Future research directions may include human-AI collaboration in pedagogy, the ethics of AI-generated design content, and learner adaptation to AI-enabled design education. This research offers the most recent review of AI in practice in design schools, helping educators and policymakers alike shape the role AI plays within the design education context.},

The study focuses on a deep learning automated system, combining an LSTM for temporal analysis for feature extraction of CNN. As well as datasets of the experiment collected 500 participants’ personalized feedback by artificial intelligence. It showed the model of CNN+LSTM that achieved a precision improvement with the error rate decreasing by 16.4\%. This study also considers Transformer-based models, such as Music Transformer and MERT, because they can model complex artistic expressions to meet new developments. And the future research will examine Transformer designs to improve the accuracy of feedback and the subtlety of song. Ultimately, the system can create flexible, objective, and adaptable programs in music education training.},

The new approach integrates artificial intelligence and virtual reality (VR) technology for the development of an interactive VR learning game. The use of AI facilitates the development of a picture library that is thoughtfully crafted to match the distinctive linguistic and thematic characteristics inherent in classical poetry. This machine-generated system creates atmospheric drawings with respect to the text of the poem, giving designers a series of idea visualisations. The drawings are utilized as a basis for the subsequent design of VR scenes, in which sensory experiences and avatars are employed to immerse the user in the poetic environment. The system takes full advantage of user interactivity and imagination, providing an active platform for exploring poetic moods. The integration of virtual reality and artificial intelligence in this study is of paramount importance in enhancing the instruction of classical poetry, developing deep cultural affinities, and promoting the continuation and innovation of classical Chinese culture and poetry.},

For each version we informed audiences of how the performance was developed either before or after they had taken a survey on their perceptions of the performance. There were thirty-nine participants (13 males, 26 female) recruited and divided between the four performances. After the survey, we conducted focus groups with a subset of audience members. Results demonstrated that individuals were more inclined to attribute artistic merit to works made by GenAI when they were unaware its use.

  abstract = {Filigree art, which represents typical intricate metalwork, has been captivating audiences worldwide with its delicate lace-like patterns and interwoven metal wires’ refined aesthetics. Particularly, Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage filigree craftsmanship has a unique aesthetic value in fine patterns and complex three-dimensional shapes. However, designing and creating filigree artworks is a labor-intensive and technically complex task and often requires extensive training and a deep understanding of the craft, which limits its design aesthetic and cultural continuity. Aiming to overcome these challenges, this study proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) -aided method that uses AI-generated content (AIGC) technology to accelerate the visualization process of this time-consuming and intricate craft by investigating the role of AI in craft design. First, a comprehensive study of filigree art culture is conducted to identify more than ten historic filigree techniques to obtain AI opportunities. Then, an AI-powered framework called AIFiligree is developed by optimizing culture-based labels and training parameters, enabling the generation of highly authentic fine filigree structures. Further, user workflows are introduced to support diverse design scenarios. Through user studies involving 22 filigree experts and 16 designers, we finally gained insights into AI’s opportunities and challenges in cultural learning, expression, and design.},

However, DETR still faces low detection accuracy and efficiency problems when dealing with small objects and complex backgrounds. In order to enhance the performance of DETR in aircraft detection, this paper proposes an aircraft detection method based on an improved DETR architecture, which mainly consists of two innovative improvements: first, an ECA attention mechanism is introduced after CNN feature extraction to enhance the model's adaptive learning ability for important features; second, Swin Transformer is used to replace the encoder in the original DETR -decoder structure in the original DETR, using its local windowing self-attention mechanism to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of the model. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper improves the detection accuracy and speed compared with the traditional DETR in the aircraft detection task, especially in the complex background with better robustness and generalization ability. The research in this paper provides an effective improvement idea for the Transformer-based target detection method and provides new technical support for high-precision target detection tasks in practical applications.},

High-income groups clearly occupy an advantageous position in the access and application of artificial intelligence technology. Their access frequency, application depth and technology dependence are far greater than those of low-income groups. Data analysis shows that there are significant differences in the adoption and application of artificial intelligence technology among social classes.

These innovations promise more improved diagnoses and time-saving cost-effectiveness. However, GenAI’s rapid implementation poses significant challenges for meeting regulatory, ethical, and trustworthiness standards. These challenges include data privacy issues, reproducibility concerns, algorithmic bias in training data causing disparities in outcomes, and a lack of transparency and explainability. Unresolved, these issues could negatively affect the public’s confidence in and perception of GenAI systems. Addressing these challenges, international AI governance frameworks, including the EU AI Act and WHO guidelines, prioritize regulatory adherence, trustworthiness, and the explainability of healthcare AI systems. While such frameworks have expanded, a deficiency remains in translating policy into effective compliance mechanisms. We propose a Compliance Agentic Model (CAM) framework to help organizations comply with GenAI and machine learning (ML)-based solutions. The CAM framework establishes trustworthiness in GenAI applications used in healthcare, ensuring alignment with organizational values and ethical standards to enhance accountability and regulatory adherence.},

This paper proposes the Emotion-Art Prompt Framework (EAPF) which provides a systematic link between Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions and L\"{o}vheim's three-dimensional model with basic underlying elements of art — form, color, light/shadow, and composition to facilitate drawing generation in an AI setting. This paper describes a new system architecture that autonomously maps layered emotional descriptors onto structured prompts interfacing with the Tencent Yuanbao AI drawing platform. Through a large-scale experiment involving more than 800 students (aged 10–12) in Shenzhen (China), we assessed quantitative and qualitative data embedded in emotional alignment, creative engagement, and platform suitability. Our findings show that EAPF substantially improves the emotional expressiveness of AI-generated works of art, while offering data-based insights for educators to tailor art teaching to individual student preferences. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of well-designed prompt engineering to overcome accessibility barriers in traditional art education while enhancing emotional development. Additionally, it proposes a scalable model for integrating AI technologies into K–12 creative learning.},

  abstract = {In recent years, pre-trained language models have seen significant success in natural language processing and have been increasingly applied to code-related tasks. Code intelligence tasks have shown promising performance with the support of code pre-trained language models. Pre-processing code simplification methods have been introduced to prune code tokens from the model’s input while maintaining task effectiveness. These methods improve the efficiency of code intelligence tasks while reducing computational costs. Post-prediction code simplification methods provide explanations for code intelligence task outcomes, enhancing the reliability and interpretability of model predictions. However, comprehensive evaluations of these methods across diverse code pre-trained model architectures and code intelligence tasks are lacking. To assess the effectiveness of code simplification methods, we conduct an empirical study integrating these code simplification methods with various pre-trained code models across multiple code intelligence tasks.Our empirical findings suggest that developing task-specific code simplification methods would be beneficial. Then, we recommend leveraging post-prediction methods to summarize prior knowledge, which can pre-process code simplification strategies. Moreover, establishing more evaluation mechanisms for code simplification is crucial. Finally, we propose incorporating code simplification methods into the pre-training phase of code pre-trained models to enhance their program comprehension and code representation capabilities.},

This paper takes Text-Mining process of blind review comments of master's theses from a university as an example to explore the application effectiveness of AI technology in the quality management of master's thesis. Through empirical research, it provides a case reference for the application of AI in higher education management and a replicable integration program for similar institutions. This study used a three- phase approach to analyse blind review comments, namely independent use of AI (ChatGPT), independent use of traditional text analysis tools (NVIVO), and collaborative analysis combining the two. It was found that despite the significant advantages of AI in terms of processing speed and scale, the AI's output highly depends on the user's prompts and pre-training. Moreover, human intervention was critical to the stability and accuracy of AI's output.},

  abstract = {The deep learning model LSTM (Long Short - Term Memory) can be used to deal with the problem of sequences, and is currently the most commonly used model to deal with music training. The process of LSTM training is sequence-to-sequence, which allows the back-and-forth relationship of notes in an instrument to be learnt by the model; however, when dealing with multiple instruments, there are multiple sequences that need to be processed at the same time, which is a limitation of the LSTM model architecture, which makes most of the current automated composition systems for single instrument training and output. However, when dealing with multiple instruments, there are multiple sequences that need to be processed at the same time, which is a limitation of the LSTM model architecture, and this makes most of the current automated composers train and output for a single instrument. Currently it is visible to deal with LSTM multiple sequences problem. Whereas this study needs to achieve multiple sound event sequence inputs corresponding to multiple sequence outputs, and the sequences are connected to each other, a problem for which there is no effective solution at present. This study attempts to choose to use Deep Improvisation (Tatsuya, 2017) for improvement by training a single track and optimizing and modifying the system to be able to have two tracks of input and two tracks of output to achieve a more resilient system, which in turn creates more realistic music. Due to the above background, the motivation to improve the deep learning automatic songwriting system arises with the expectation that the research in this paper will improve the system to be able to produce multi-tracked and more realistic music, so that more researchers will be able to apply the system to be able to produce songs and apply them to a variety of contexts at a small cost.},

Podcasts have grown increasingly relevant in education due to their accessibility and ability to integrate learning into everyday life. With the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI), there is a unique opportunity for scalable and adaptable creation of learning media. However, with novel technology, there also come new challenges. Thus, we developed fine-tuned AI-generated podcasts using Google NotebookLM, our course materials, and a custom prompt. We conducted a one-month explorative evaluation in the field using a qualitative diary study. Our study reveals that students find the podcasts beneficial for flexible everyday learning but also point toward challenges like a lack of emotional engagement and technical non-English language issues. In sum, our study highlights the current benefits and challenges of AI-generated podcasts and presents an agenda for future research.},

  year = {2025},

  abstract = {Observers and practitioners of artificial intelligence (AI) have proposed an FDA-style licensing regime for the most advanced AI models, or 'frontier' models. In this paper, we explore the applicability of approval regulation - that is, regulation of a product that combines experimental minima with government licensure conditioned partially or fully upon that experimentation - to the regulation of frontier AI. There are a number of reasons to believe that approval regulation, simplistically applied, would be inapposite for frontier AI risks. Domains of weak fit include the difficulty of defining the regulated product, the presence of Knightian uncertainty or deep ambiguity about harms from AI, the potentially transmissible nature of risks, and distributed activities among actors involved in the AI lifecycle. We conclude by highlighting the role of policy learning and experimentation in regulatory development, describing how learning from other forms of AI regulation and improvements in evaluation and testing methods can help to overcome some of the challenges we identify.},

Through the bibliometric and content analysis methods, together with the CiteSpace tool, highlight the trending application of this technology in education, the distribution characteristics of the core authors and institutions' postings, and the clustering analysis of the research hotspots. The results show continued wide adoption of generative AI technology in education in recent years, peaking sharply in 2023. There hasn't been a stable core group of authors within the field, and the collaborative network is relatively sparse. Research hotspots mainly cover artificial intelligence, human-computer collaboration and educational transformation, which indicates the function generative AI technology could have within the digital transformation and quality enhancement of education. This paper additionally shows the actualization of generative AI technology through its presentation of AI tutors and teaching assistants, teaching models reform, and reshaped instructional evaluation systems via case studies. In face of misuse, integrity issues, and ethical concerns arising, there is a need to find a balance in the application of the technology, such that its more proper development can promote rather than replace human subjectivity.},

Based on current advanced multilingual model architectures and cross-modal content generation technologies, an automatic generation system for teaching resources supporting 12 languages is constructed.  Experimental data showed that the system led to a 41.2\% increase in learning efficiency in a Tamil course at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) (p&lt;0.01, n=320), while a test of teaching Chinese as a second language at the Beijing Language and Culture University (BLCU) showed that AIGC-generated personalized exercises reduced the learner error rate by 33.7\%.  The study further revealed that (i) the cost of generating instructional materials for low-resource languages (e.g., Kiswahili) decreased to 18.5\% of the traditional approach;  and (ii) through an authoritative equity assessment framework, it was confirmed that the technological solution could narrow the digital education divide between developing and developed countries by up to 27.3 percentage points.  This provides actionable technological support for the equity goals of the UN's Education 2030 Agenda.},

  abstract = {Finding out the consistency between two entities is important for grouping or learning similar behavior for classification and recommendations. Consistency means that an entity follows a certain similar pattern when related to other entities in the same group. Models are often classified according to categories, uses, complexity level, similar sets of classes, and other attributes. Heterogeneous models tend to have similar patterns and categories thus giving rise to an inconsistency. Identifying the similarity and consistency becomes crucial in Model-driven engineering where we often have to group UML/ECORE models for various purposes such as classification, Machine learning, and recommendation systems. In this paper, We have introduced the Siamese neural network to determine the similarity between the two models. This network carefully extracts the relevant features from the given models and generates the similarity index based on features and contextual information. The proposed approach has been validated using the Modelset dataset with an accuracy of 96.67\% percent. The proposed approach sets a solid platform to evaluate model consistencies for different purposes.},

  abstract = {A pumped storage plant (PSP) is an indispensable facility for energy storage and grid regulation in the electrical power system (EPS), and its efficient and safe operation significantly impacts the stability and economy of the power grid. Modern PSP typically features intelligent equipment systems capable of real-time data collection and efficient data analysis, with integrated fault diagnosis, early warning, and efficient communication functions, providing a solid foundation for intelligent power station management and operation. Considering the crucial importance of accurately monitoring equipment status in PSP for safe and economical operation, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a key means to improve monitoring efficiency and accuracy. This article proposes an innovative AI-based monitoring system for PSP equipment status. The system utilizes deep learning (DL) algorithms to achieve autonomous learning and extraction of operating status features, enabling accurate performance evaluation and health status prediction of critical equipment. Experimental results show that the system not only significantly improves the accuracy of fault recognition but also shortens the response time of fault warning, effectively preventing potential safety risks.},

  abstract = {Financial texts contain rich emotional information, which is of great significance for capturing emotional fluctuations in financial markets, assisting investors in decision-making and implementing financial risk management. However, sentiment information of financial texts requires a lot of domain expert knowledge, and manual retrieval is expensive. In this paper, we propose the application of an evolutionary generative model for sentiment retrieval of financial information based on interactive genetic algorithms from the perspective of user implicit modeling. The uncertain preference estimation of evolutionary individuals is realized. The user preference model is adjusted according to the uncertainty evaluation, and the user preference is dynamically tracked to obtain the fitness value of the evolutionary individual for evolutionary optimization. The experimental results show that the proposed method can implicitly perceive user preferences, reduce user explicit evaluation, reduce user fatigue, and improve the search performance of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {Service model is the general way to deliver services. This study focuses on the library service model with AI empowerment. Through literature analysis, user demand investigations, and system development practices, this paper discusses the innovation and optimization strategy with AI technology for library service model. The traditional library service models are limited, and most of them are query and supply of book resources. With the development of technology and knowledge acquisition, the traditional library service model no longer meets the personalized retrieval needs and cross-domain retrieval needs. In recent years, some libraries have intelligent chat robots, but most of them can only answer some fixed questions instead of answering personalized questions such as books in a certain field. AI technology can significantly improve service efficiency and user experience through natural language processing, intelligent recommendation algorithm and cross-domain resource integration ability. This study designed and implemented an intelligent service system based on WeChat applet and Button Platform, including intelligent search, personalized recommendation, book review aggregation and other functional modules, which improved the library's current service model and solved the problems caused by limited service models.},

This paper seeks to understand the problems of teaching choral tunes in a way that the singing voice is not easy to learn and the students are not easy to understand the instructor's verbal comments and corrections, and proposes the use of artificial intelligence technology to assist the teaching of choral tunes and to solve the above problems. This paper proposes an auxiliary system for choral teaching, for which this study collects a collection of a cappella vocal recordings of a choral seven-word tune, and uses music information retrieval and machine learning algorithms to analyze and compare the recording files, and outputs style similarity scores and visualization charts of the user's input and the collection of sound files. Teachers of choral teaching can use this system to solve the difficulties in teaching choral promotion, and the karaoke game-like tune teaching system has a higher willingness to learn for choral beginners.},

  abstract = {Generative AI is transforming the educational landscape, raising significant concerns about cheating. Despite the widespread use of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in assessments, the detection of AI cheating in MCQ-based tests has been almost unexplored, in contrast to the focus on detecting AI-cheating on text-rich student outputs. In this paper, we propose a method based on the application of Item Response Theory (IRT) to address this gap. Our approach operates on the assumption that artificial and human intelligence exhibit different response patterns, with AI cheating manifesting as deviations from the expected patterns of human responses. These deviations are modeled using Person-Fit Statistics (PFS). We demonstrate that this method effectively highlights the differences between human responses and those generated by premium versions of leading chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini), but that it is also sensitive to the amount of AI cheating in the data. Furthermore, we show that the chatbots differ in their reasoning profiles. Our work provides both a theoretical foundation and empirical evidence for the application of IRT to identify AI cheating in MCQ-based assessments.},

  abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly impact society, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) is the first legislative attempt to regulate AI systems. This paper proposes a governance framework for organizations innovating with AI systems. Building upon secondary research, the framework aims at driving a balance between four types of pressures that organizations, innovating with AI, experience, and thereby creating responsible value. These pressures encompass AI/technology, normative, value creation, and regulatory aspects. The framework is partially validated through primary research in two phases. In the first phase, a conceptual model is proposed that measures the extent to which organizational tasks result in AIA compliance, using elements from the AIA as mediators and strategic variables such as organization size, extent of outsourcing, and offshoring as moderators. 34 organizations in the Netherlands are surveyed to test the conceptual model. The average actual compliance score of the 34 participants is low, and most participants exaggerate their compliance. Organization size is found to have significant impact on AIA compliance. In phase 2, two case studies are conducted with the purpose of generating in-depth insights to validate the proposed framework. The case studies confirm the interplay of the four pressures on organizations innovating with AI, and furthermore substantiate the governance framework.},

It puts forward a journey from March 2023 to January 2025; the researcher (as artist/artist as a researcher) examines how generative artificial intelligence tools, including ChatGPT and MidJourney, reignited a passion for looser (imperfect) art practice. This process led to self-scrutiny through self-portrait that bridges personal and research. While generative artificial intelligence ignited creativity, it brought authenticity, originality, and tensions with ethics. These concerns are addressed through themes such as attribution transparency, the ethics of relying on non-human solutions and balancing inspiration versus imitation. The pictorial shares extracts from a two-year digital sketchbook that reflects how GAI can support artists in times of crisis and contributes to broader conversations about GAI's role in art practice. It invites readers to consider the evolving relationship between artists and GAI in shaping the future of art practice.},

Traditional models struggle to meet dynamic and personalized demands. This study systematically examines the pathways and challenges of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in GaoKao application planning, constructing a “perception-analysis-response” technical closed-loop framework. Through multimodal data fusion, dynamic decision optimization and service chain design, AI technologies can address the limitations of traditional planning models: integrating of academic performance, psychological assessments and policy data at front-end; generating a five-dimensional decision-making system and risk-alert models based on intelligent algorithms at middle-end; and delivering personalized reports and real-time tracking services at back-end. Case analyses reveal that 3 application models, including commercialization, public-benefit and technology-integration, achieve cost efficiency, equity orientation and technological breakthroughs respectively, while facing challenges such as algorithmic transparency, sustainable operations and ethical risks at the same time. The study further uncovers multidimensional paradoxes in technological empowerment, including conflicts between algorithmic authority and educational subjectivity, and class solidification exacerbated by digital divides. To address these issues, an education-oriented ethical framework must be established, together with dynamic adaptation mechanisms and equity compensation arrangement, to foster a collaborative governance system driven by “technology + humanistic” synergy. This research provides theoretical and practical insights for optimizing educational resource allocation and advancing scientific decision-making, offering significant implications for modernizing educational governance.},

  abstract = {The paper proposes “speculative metaphors” as constructs for reframing and critically engaging with ideas of artificial intelligence. It identifies a broad range of AI metaphors in the wider culture and technical literature and discusses metaphor design in terms of explanation, persuasion and speculation. To explore different metaphor design strategies, we use a custom GPT to generate a large number of variants on the “artificial intelligence” metaphor.  The paper contributes a conceptual framing for such speculative metaphor drawing on ideas of knowledge and understanding, fusion and synthesis, collaboration and collectives. We argue that generating speculative metaphors provides a means of thinking critically about human-AI interaction.},

Implementing AI models at scale and ensuring cost-effective production of AI-based technologies through entirely in-house capabilities is a challenge. The success of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) Cloud Computing models can be leveraged to facilitate a cost-effective and scalable AI service paradigm, namely, “AI as a Service” (AIaaS). We summarize current state-of-the-art solutions for AIaaS, and we discuss its prospects for growth and opportunities to advance the concept. To this end, we perform a thorough review of recent research on AI and various deployment strategies for emerging domains considering both technical as well as survey articles. Next, we identify various characteristics and capabilities that need to be met before an AIaaS model can be successfully designed and deployed. Based on this, we present a general framework of an AIaaS architecture that integrates the required aaS characteristics with the capabilities of AI. We also compare various approaches for offering AIaaS to end users. Finally, we illustrate several real-world use cases for AIaaS models, followed by a discussion of some of the challenges that must be addressed to enable AIaaS adoption.},

It is the route one must take to promote the quality and efficiency of higher education. The number of overseas students is one of critical indexes to evaluate the internationalization of higher education. However, with the increasing proportion of overseas students, how to balance the contradiction between personalized and generalized education has become the focus of current curriculum teaching reform. This study selects Jinan University, the highest institution for overseas Chinese in China, as the research location, and treats the C language course for electrical engineering and automation major as a case. The differences in learning foundation and training targets between mainland and overseas students are discussed. Furthermore, a six-step teaching reform framework using artificial intelligence technology is proposed. It not only comprehensively analyzes the key points in teaching, but also uses artificial intelligence technology to compensate the difficulty in meeting students' personalized needs in large courses, which may provide reference for educators and lecturers.},

  abstract = {With the development of the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education, countries and international organizations have introduced relevant policies to address the opportunities and challenges it brings to education. A thorough analysis of these policies on a global scale is important for guiding educational innovation and ensuring the effectiveness of technology applications. This article uses a content analysis method, taking 26 artificial intelligence education policies from major countries and international organizations as samples, and employs a "policy tool—policy content" two-dimensional analysis framework to quantitatively analyze the policy texts to reveal the characteristics of international artificial intelligence education policies. The study finds that the current types of policy tools are mainly supply-oriented and environmental-oriented, focusing more on dimensions such as quality assessment and assurance, resource environment construction, and future talent cultivation in terms of content elements. Supply-side tools provide resource support for the construction of intelligent educational environments and innovative cultivation services for the improvement of teachers' and students' intelligent literacy; environmental tools build institutional standards for the quality assurance of intelligent education and create organizational strategies to achieve inclusive and fair education. Finally, the study proposes suggestions for the formulation and optimization of artificial intelligence education policies from four aspects: strengthening talent cultivation, focusing on independent research and development, deepening international exchanges, and systematic policy design, to promote the high-quality development of teaching and education in the digital age.},

Using a mixed-method approach with advanced computational knowledge in this study, an integrated framework was computed and classified into hierarchical levels of consumer engagement. During the process, a set of sustainability metrics were selected (here, carbon footprint, supply chain transparency, and ethical compliance) together with the degree of consumer alignment in sustainability of marketing strategies. The proposed work also intends to expand and validate in-depth research using the Analytic Hierarchy Process to discover, analyze, and synthesize an accessible overview of the interconnections surrounding the numerous decision-making factors involved with the use of AI in eco-marketing communications. This research will contribute significantly to addressing the ongoing sustainability concerns of the global population in their use of AI-driven technologies in various eco-marketing applications by addressing technical implementation limitations, cultural differences, and other contextual barriers. It will also help to bridge the gap between corporate eco-initiatives and the environmentally conscious population by addressing consumer preference inconsistencies. By giving attention to this emerging field, this piece of research will provide a better foundation for how to optimize eco-marketing communications and overcome the knowledge and implementation gap of sustainable practices among diverse consumer demographics from several perspectives.},

Software engineering, as an increasingly complex process to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain large-scale software systems for solving real-world challenges, is profoundly affected by many revolutionary artificial intelligence tools in general and machine learning in particular. In this roadmap for artificial intelligence in software engineering, we highlight the recent deep impact of artificial intelligence on software engineering by discussing successful stories of applications of artificial intelligence to classic and new software development challenges. We identify the new challenges that the software engineering community has to address in the coming years to successfully apply artificial intelligence in software engineering, and we share our research roadmap toward the effective use of artificial intelligence in the software engineering profession, while still protecting fundamental human values.We spotlight three main areas that challenge the research in software engineering: the use of generative artificial intelligence and large language models for engineering large software systems, the need of large and unbiased datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating deep learning and large language models for software engineering, and the need of a new code of digital ethics to apply artificial intelligence in software engineering.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has wide applications in virtual reality (VR), especially in analyzing its implementation progress, existing limitations, and future development paths. This study finds that AI's main contributions to VR are in four key areas: creating intelligent virtual characters, advancing education and training, providing medical assistance, and generating dynamic scenes. This interdisciplinary convergence also brings significant opportunities, particularly in sectors such as education, healthcare, gaming, and corporate training. Additionally, the study discusses technical challenges related to computational costs, real-time feedback, user privacy, and algorithmic ethics. Critical challenges persist in data processing bottlenecks, privacy protection issues, and user adaptation.

  abstract = {This study explores the systematic integration of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in university English language teaching, focusing on the core challenge of optimising the teaching closure loop. Using a mixed research method (questionnaire survey, classroom experiment and content analysis), AIGC was found to have significant efficacy in multimodal resource generation, personalised feedback and intercultural scene simulation. The study proposes a three-dimensional collaborative teaching framework: teacher-AIGC-learners, which reveals that the core value of AIGC is to liberate teachers from mechanical labour and achieve precise teaching interventions. Meanwhile, the study faces the ethical dilemmas of academic integrity and data privacy, and proposes a governance framework that combines technological constraints, institutional norms, and humanistic education. The experimental data show that AIGC assistance increases students' writing complexity by 27.9\% and decreases their speaking anxiety index by 34\%, but there are also problems such as weakened critical thinking due to technological dependence. This study provides a reusable pedagogical model and risk coping strategy for the digital transformation of education.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technology, its application in the field of education has gradually become an important direction of teaching reform. This paper takes the course of “Java Framework Application “in software technology major as the research object, discusses how to empower the traditional teaching mode through AIGC technology, and improve the teaching quality and practical effect of the course. Firstly, the pain points existing in the current Java framework course teaching were analyzed, including the shortage of case resources, the single practice scene, and the lack of personalized guidance. Secondly, combined with the technical characteristics of AIGC, a multi-dimensional application model covering code generation, intelligent question answering, scene simulation and learning effect evaluation was constructed. By introducing a large language model to automatically generate customized case codes of mainstream frameworks such as Spring Boot and MyBatis, conversational AI is used to assist students to solve development problems in real time, and a virtual project scene is constructed based on generative technology to strengthen engineering practice ability. Teaching practice shows that the application of AIGC technology greatly improves students 'code standardization and project development efficiency, and teachers can accurately locate learning weaknesses through intelligent analysis tools. This study provides a reusable implementation path for the intelligent transformation of technology courses, and verifies the empowering value of generative artificial intelligence in the field of vocational education, which has important reference significance for the optimization of future curriculum system.},

This article uses CiteSpace software to conduct a visual analysis of research related to AI in language education from the SCI and SSCI databases over the past five years. The research results indicate that from 2020 to 2024, the number of papers related to AI in language education has been increasing steadily with the improvement of AI technologies. What's more, China, the United States, South Korea, England, and Saudi Arabia are the leading countries in terms of publication volume. Institutions such as the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Education University of Hong Kong, and Indiana University System (including Indiana University Bloomington), etc. have a significant number of publications, and collaborative publications among institutions are the mainstream. Moreover, the keyword co-occurrence graph shows that students’ English learning, large language models, natural language processing technology and deep learning are the foci of scholars' research. Keyword clustering graph and top terms in each cluster indicate that research in this field primarily focuses on English learning, particularly on speech and writing skills, and the psychological factors, learning effect, and learning strategies in the process of AI-assisted language education have also attracted the attention of scholars. Lastly, computational modeling technologies and mobile-assisted language learning are also topics that scholars have discussed extensively. The application of AI in non-English languages education, emotional factors of students and mobile-assisted language education driven by large language models may become hotspots in the future.},

This study suggested a powerful and effective technique that can process the large volumes of data and can specifically examine the positive, negative, and fake feedback of “AI-driven marketing communication,” which is considered a big challenge, as unstructured data related to the marketing sector is considered of high complexity. On the other hand, personalization efforts and automation-related challenges in AI-driven marketing communication have confused marketers, researchers, and teachers. An efficient machine learning approach should be used to gather more structured insights in order to identify behavioral patterns. Customer sentiment records (structured and unstructured) have gained significant attention worldwide for understanding the behaviors of diverse consumer groups. Analysis of the marketing communication sector still does not provide a clear picture of the information available in these datasets, especially if this unstructured and fake feedback affects the field of customer engagement. This study has proposed an advanced AI-based framework to eliminate inconsistencies in information, the optimization mechanism for a fusion of structured and unstructured data as parts where a fusion of sentiment analysis and machine learning with predictive analytics is applied for the task of customer feedback classification. Experiments show that our hybrid approach obtains a higher accuracy value of customer satisfaction predictions, compared with different baseline approaches, with various sizes of structured and unstructured datasets. Based on our knowledge, the proposed framework can learn from unified datasets to obtain good insights, better results than one that can be learned from isolated data sources.},

  abstract = {This paper explores using artificial intelligence (AI) in applications to detect tomato leaf diseases. A key issue is how automated systems and artificial intelligence can be used to diagnose and predict disease control, damage, and temporary control of tomato diseases. The paper is based on the study of the benefits of implementing classical and modern artificial intelligence models, their problems, and successful technological solutions in detecting tomato diseases. The article describes in detail how effective distributed artificial intelligence algorithms are in detecting tomato diseases, their application, and their independence in analyzing and accounting for the results. As a result, it is important to use artificial intelligence to detect tomato leaf diseases quickly, and this discovery offers effective methods for faster treatment. Tomato export is considered important for the economy of Uzbekistan, one of the developing agricultural countries today [1,2]. However, even in this area, there are cases of crop loss, so we created and analyzed a project that detects tomato leaf diseases based on deep learning with transfer learning architectures.},

In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of AIoT research. We examine AIoT literature related to sensing, computing, and networking \&amp; communication, which form the three key components of AIoT. In addition to advancements in these areas, we review domain-specific AIoT systems that are designed for various important application domains. We have also created an accompanying GitHub repository, where we compile the papers included in this survey: https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/AIoT-Survey. This repository will be actively maintained and updated with new research as it becomes available. As both IoT and AI become increasingly critical to our society, we believe that AIoT is emerging as an essential research field at the intersection of IoT and modern AI. It is our hope that this survey will serve as a valuable resource for those engaged in AIoT research and act as a catalyst for future explorations to bridge gaps and drive advancements in this exciting field.},

Intelligent assessment systems powered by powerful data processing and analysis capabilities can accurately assess teaching efficiency and student learning progress. The collaborative framework between teachers and technology emphasizes the optimal use of teachers’ professional skills, supported by advanced technologies, thereby improving teaching efficiency and quality. Regarding the application of technology, semantic analysis is performed using the BERT model, the random forest algorithm is used to optimize teaching scenarios, and the structural equation model is applied to evaluate moral hazard. Chinese teaching practice using virtual reality technology shows that students' cultural perception ability has improved by 42\%, a finding that has been verified by rigorous statistical tests (P &lt; 0.001) and is therefore very reliable. In addition, the writing aids used significantly improved students’ Chinese writing skills, with students using these tools increasing their average Chinese score by 15\%. These empirical data firmly affirm the value of cutting-edge technology in language education in vocational schools.},

Use the Python language to crawl words related to "supply chain risk" in corporate annual reports, which are used to calculate the supply chain risk of enterprises. The fixed effects model and the intermediary effect model are used to empirically test the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in mitigating the supply chain risk. Through empirical research, we find that: AI plays an instrumental role in mitigating corporate supply chain risk. AI mitigates the supply chain risk by improving resource allocation efficiency of enterprises. The heterogeneity analysis shows that for enterprises in highly competitive industries, the mitigating effect of AI on the supply chain risk is more evident; in non-technology-oriented enterprises, the mitigating effect of artificial intelligence on supply chain risk is more significant. This study contributes to the research on intelligent supply chain management and supply chain risk management.},

An intelligent architecture inspired by cyber twins is proposed to explore the unique visual, behavioral, and physiological experiences of individuals with anxiety disorders while working in smart office environments. Temporal data mining is utilized for framing data granules, and quantum probability techniques are employed for anomaly detection within the framework. Additionally, a novel multilayer Convolutional Neural Network is introduced to predict a quantifiable Health Vulnerability Index. A smart alert system is included, capable of notifying caregivers of any identified health concerns, enabling timely assistance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, it was tested on real-world data comprising 82,235 cases. The results demonstrate that the method excels in several key performance metrics: time efficiency (24.6s), classification efficiency (Precision (92.77\%), Specificity (92.43\%), and Sensitivity (92.82\%)), decision-making efficiency ( (r^{2}=79\%) ), error rate (AAE 0.31\%), and stability (75\%), surpassing current state-of-the-art methodologies.},

  abstract = {More than the 70 years since its emergence in the early 1950s, artificial intelligence (AI) is performing cognitive tasks traditionally considered the unique province of humans. This progress did not occur in a vacuum. AI emerged against a rich background of technologies from computer science and ideas about intelligence and learning from philosophy, psychology, logic, game theory, and cognitive science. We sketch out the enabling technologies for AI. They include search, reasoning, neural networks, natural language processing, signal processing and computer graphics, programming and conventional software engineering, human-computer interaction, communications, and specialized hardware that provides supercomputing power. Beyond these technologies is the notion of Artificial General Intelligence that has or exceeds the capabilities of the human brain. Currently this is completely aspirational and is not expected to be possible before 2025, if ever. Artificial Intelligence is based on a variety of technologies, none of which seek to emulate human intelligence.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are the first neural network machines capable of carrying on conversations with humans. They are trained on billions of words of text scraped from the internet. They generate text responses to text inputs. They have transformed the public awareness of artificial intelligence, bringing on reactions ranging from astonishment and awe to trepidation and horror. They have spurred massive investments in new tools for drafting texts, summarizing conversations, summarizing literature, generating images, coding simple programs, supporting education, and amusing humans. Experience with them has shown them likely to respond with fabrications (called "hallucinations") that severely undermine their trustworthiness and make them unsafe for critical applications. Here, we will examine the limitations of LLMs imposed by their design and function. These are not bugs but are inherent limitations of the technology. The same limitations make it unlikely that LLM machines will ever be capable of performing all human tasks at the skill levels of humans.},

Artificial intelligence is defined to be a collection of machines and algorithms that perform tasks normally considered to require human cognition. Opinions and claims about the possible benefits and risks of AI are all over the map. In response to the confusion, the Ubiquity editors are launching a symposium on AI. It will be a series of about two dozen articles on the many aspects of AI and its applications. The series will be synthesized into the "Ubiquity Report on Artificial Intelligence," which is intended to be an authoritative and trustworthy summary of present and future AI.},

  abstract = {In order to study the compressive strength of cemented gravel, a compressive strength prediction model was established; with 142 groups of in-house uniaxial compressive strength test data of cemented gravel with different mixing ratios as the object of study, the 11 influencing factors in the samples were downscaled by using the principal component analysis method, and the downscaled principal components were used as the input layer of the BPNN, so as to establish the compressive strength prediction of cemented gravel based on the PCA-BPNN model. The results show that when the number of principal components is 3, the cumulative contribution rate of the principal components reaches 86.483\%, and the contribution rates of the three principal components are 65.084\%, 11.702\%, 9.097\%, and the eigenvalues of the three principal components are all greater than 1. Then the three principal components are used as the input layer to build the compressive strength model of cemented gravel based on PCA-BPNN, and the RMSEs of the training set and test set are 0.253 and 0.28, respectively. The RMSE of the training set and the test set are 0.253 and 0.286, and the R2 is 0.947 and 0.942, which are not much different from the BPNN model with the number of nodes in the input layer of 6 and 11 before dimensionality reduction, and they are obviously better than the BPNN model in the convergence speed and training time. It can be seen that the PCA-BPNN model has good prediction effect and prediction efficiency, especially drastically reducing the training time, which provides a new idea for the prediction research of the mechanical properties of cemented gravel.},

  abstract = {Image generation using generative artificial intelligence has become a popular activity. However, text-to-image generation—where images are produced from typed prompts—can be less engaging in public settings since the act of typing tends to limit interactive audience participation, thereby reducing its suitability for designing dynamic public installations. In this article, we explore body prompting as input modality for image generation in the context of public event settings. Body prompting extends interaction with generative AI beyond textual inputs to reconnect the creative act of image generation with the physical act of creating artworks. We implement this concept in an interactive art installation, Artworks Reimagined, designed to transform existing artworks via body prompting. We deployed the installation at an event with hundreds of visitors in a public and private setting. Our semi-structured interviews with a sample of visitors (N = 79) show that body prompting was well-received and provides an engaging and fun experience. We present insights into participants’ experience of body prompting and AI co-creation and identify three distinct strategies of embodied interaction focused on re-creating, reimagining, or casual interaction. We provide valuable recommendations for practitioners seeking to design interactive generative AI experiences in museums, galleries, and public event spaces.},

To this end, this paper proposes the CapABSA model, which takes sensitive words as aspects, combines capsule neural networks to capture multidimensional semantic features, and migrates document-based sentiment analysis (DBSA) to ABSA through transfer learning to improve classification performance. Experiments show that the model performs effectively in sentence datasets containing sensitive words, providing a more fine-grained solution for sensitive information filtering.},

The Chinese government has introduced a number of strategic policies to promote the development of new generation artificial intelligence and has made significant progress, but there are still large differences in the research and development, application and industrialization of AI technology in different regions. To this end, this research sorted out the definition of new generation artificial intelligence and established a comprehensive evaluation index system including four dimensions: development scale, economic benefits, innovation input and scientific and technological output. Based on panel data from 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, the entropy method was used to analyze the development level of new generation artificial intelligence in various regions from 2017 to 2021. The results show that the overall development level of China's new generation of artificial intelligence shows a steady growth trend. The development of AI in the eastern region leads the country, while the development level of AI in the central, western and northeastern regions is relatively low, and the gap is widening year by year.},

  abstract = {Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various generative tasks such as image synthesis, text-to-image, and text-guided image-to-image generation. However, the more powerful the DMs, the more harmful they can potentially be. Recent studies have shown that DMs are prone to a wide range of attacks, including adversarial attacks, membership inference attacks, backdoor injection, and various multi-modal threats. Since numerous pre-trained DMs are published widely on the Internet, potential threats from these attacks are especially detrimental to society, making DM-related security a topic worthy of investigation. Therefore, in this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the security aspect of DMs, focusing on various attack and defense methods for DMs. First, we present crucial knowledge of DMs with five main types of DMs, including denoising diffusion probabilistic models, denoising diffusion implicit models, noise conditioned score networks, stochastic differential equations, and multi-modal conditional DMs. We provide a comprehensive survey of recent works investigating different types of attacks that exploit the vulnerabilities of DMs. Then, we thoroughly review potential countermeasures to mitigate each of the presented threats. Finally, we discuss open challenges of DM-related security and describe potential research directions for this topic.},

  abstract = {Audio-visual speech synthesis (AVSS) is a rapidly gaining prominence in artificial intelligence (AI) due to its widespread applications. AVSS refers to generating the audio-visual speech of a target speaker from the audio input of a source speaker, while preserving the speech content. The sequential steps of the AVSS process include voice conversion (VC) for altering vocal characteristics from the source to the target speaker and audio-visual synthesis (AVS) to generate a video stream from the converted speech of the target speaker. However, with the progressive development of deep generative models, the domain of AVSS remains relatively unexplored. The existing literature predominantly focuses on autoencoder-based AVSS models, potentially limiting their ability to capture the diversity of the vocal features and also synthesize the realistic video output. This paper introduces a novel AVSS approach utilizing a generative adversarial network (GAN) model, enriched with a capsule network (Caps-Net) architecture to effectively capture relevant input speech features and produce more natural audio-visual output. The proposed framework is trained and tested on VoxCeleb2 and LRS3-TED datasets and the experimental outcomes exhibit the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.},

  abstract = {Identifying and mapping research expertise within an organisation or research ecosystem is challenging due to the complexity and fragmentation of available research information. Researchers have diverse expertise across fields such as biology and engineering, making uniform categorisation difficult. Additionally, overlapping skills across disciplines blur boundaries, further complicating classification.This talk explores the use of Generative AI in transforming disconnected research information into structured Research Capability Maps and Research Knowledge Graphs. Recent developments in GenAI have introduced new capabilities for topic classification, subject mapping, and knowledge mining from vast amounts of literature, datasets, and other research outputs. We examine the concept of Augmented Intelligence, which integrates domain expertise with AI-assisted processes to enhance informed dialogue among researchers. This approach significantly improves the identification of research capabilities within an organisation and the assessment of research capacity within its collaboration networks.We have implemented this approach as part of Research Link Australia project within the health sector, involving health research institutions, medical research institutes (MRIs), universities, and not-for-profit organisations. This talk will present findings from this case study, demonstrating how the Augmented Intelligence approach provided a platform for fostering a shared understanding of research capabilities and capacities within this network.This work builds upon the Research Graph framework, which connects research entities including research publications, research data collections, researcher profiles, organisations and funded projects. Leveraging this framework and use of GenAI, this case study shows how fragmented research information can be transformed to a connected graph and lead to insights into research capabilities within institutions and identifying potential research collaboration opportunities in Australia ad overseas. This is a demonstration of human and AI collaboration based on a human-in-the-loop intelligence approach.},

Traditional methods of data extraction, analysis, and graph creation for annual reports are not only time-consuming but also prone to human errors. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an innovative system leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), with a specific focus on large language models (LLMs). Our solution incorporates automated data extraction from diverse sources designated as internal knowledge base, text analysis, summarization using advanced language models, and the generation as well as revisions of informative graphs. Different LLMs like Google's Gemini Pro and OpenAI's GPT 4.0 have been used to read different data visualisation graphs and fetch the information from the internal knowledge base, respectively, to update the graphs in an automated manner. Solution implementation using Python language on the World Economic Situation and Prospects report by the Department of Economic \&amp; Social Affairs, United Nation shows that the early result produces almost 0.87\% to 17.46\% average error rates in the task of factual data visualisation graph. Key benefits of this approach include improved time efficiency, consistency in report format, enhanced insights, and a user-friendly interface. A review and approval workflow facilitate user feedback, contributing to continuous model performance improvement.},

  abstract = {Students often do not fully understand the code they have written. This sometimes does not become evident until later in their education, which can mean it is harder to fix their incorrect knowledge or misunderstandings. In addition, being able to fully understand code is increasingly important in a world where students have access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as GitHub Copilot. One effective solution is to utilise code comprehension questions, where a marker asks questions about a submission to gauge understanding, this can also have the side effect of helping to detect plagiarism. However, this approach is time consuming and can be difficult and/or expensive to scale. This paper introduces AutoMCQ, which uses GenAI for the automatic generation of multiple-choice code comprehension questions. This is integrated with the CodeRunner automated assessment platform.},

Their ability to generate human-like text and ensure continuous availability facilitates the creation of interactive service chatbots aimed at enhancing customer experience and streamlining enterprise operations. Despite their potential, LLMs face critical challenges, such as a susceptibility to hallucinations and difficulties handling complex linguistic scenarios, notably code switching and dialectal variations. To address these challenges, this paper describes the design of a multilingual chatbot for Bengali-English customer service interactions utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and targeted prompt engineering. This research provides valuable insights for the human-computer interaction (HCI) community, emphasizing the importance of designing systems that accommodate linguistic diversity to benefit both customers and businesses.

This paper proposes a few-shot incremental relation extraction model based on consistency prototype learning and multi-layer knowledge distillation. The model consists of data augmentation, consistency prototype learning, and dual-layer knowledge distillation. First, data augmentation is applied to the training data to alleviate common overfitting problems in few-shot scenarios. Second, consistency prototype learning is utilized to regularize the embedding space and address feature distortion. Additionally, a dual-teacher model for knowledge distillation is designed to prevent catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. Experiments conducted on the TACRED dataset show that after completing all tasks under the 5-way-5-shot setting, accuracy improved by 2.22\%. Our model significantly outperforms other baseline methods, validating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) has revolutionized software engineering (SE) by automating tasks across design, coding, and testing [1] [2]. Tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot streamline code generation, architectural modeling, debugging, and test-case creation [3] [4]. Despite their rapid adoption in industry, the pedagogical implications of these tools in computing education have not been systematically examined. This study solves the existing gap by conducting a comprehensive benchmarking study of Gen-AI tools across four core SE phases— design documentation, feature implementation, debugging support, and testing — to address two research questions:RQ1: What strengths and limitations do Gen-AI tools exhibit in each phase?RQ2: How can insights from benchmarking inform effective integration of Gen-AI into SE curricula?To answer these questions, a diverse set of Gen-AI tools is evaluated, ranging from design-focused assistants such as Lucidchart, Mermaid.js and UIzard; implementation-oriented systems including GitHub Copilot, TabNine, Codeium and Supermaven; debugging supports like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet; and testing frameworks such as Testim, Mabl and Applitools—while also surveying emerging platforms (as of summer 2024) like Replit, Postman, Visily, Gemini, Eraser.io and others. For each tool and development phase, we applied phase-specific metrics: in design documentation, we assessed diagram accuracy, completeness, user effort, and IDE integration; in feature implementation, we measured pattern-based code generation quality, code-completion effectiveness, refactoring robustness, and UI/UX scaffolding; in debugging, we evaluated error-detection accuracy, hallucination rates, and clarity of explanatory feedback; and in testing, we examined test-case relevance and defect-detection coverage. Across all phases, we tracked prompt engineering complexity as a key mediating factor influencing tool performance.Our evaluation reveals speed-fidelity trade-offs: Code-completion assistants accelerate boilerplate generation but demand manual oversight to ensure cross-file consistency and manage higher-order abstractions; diagramming tools can produce precise UML models with minimal effort— but at the cost of iterative prompt refinement for complex cases; LLM debuggers deliver context-sensitive fixes yet suffer from nontrivial hallucination rates; testing generators exhibit wide variance in edge-case coverage. On average, tools needed 2.4 prompt iterations for usable diagrams and 1.5 prompts for bug fixes, underscoring the human effort in guiding AI.We recommend a scaffolded framework for integrating Gen-AI into SE education by: embedding AI tools into hands-on assignments, to explore tasks in a controlled context; by structuring small team projects in which one subgroup uses AI assistants while the other completes the same tasks manually (covering design, implementation, debugging and testing) to surface contrasts in workflow, tool strengths, and human reasoning; by requiring students to maintain a reflective journal documenting their AI usage and prompt-engineering strategies, fostering metacognitive insight into how tool inputs shape outputs; and by equipping learners with decision making criteria, teaching them to evaluate AI assistants according to task fit- preparing them to leverage AI responsibly across SE phases in its evolving landscape.},

While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT dominate current educational research, multimodal capabilities—such as text-to-speech and text-to-image—are less explored. This study uses topic modeling to map the research landscape of multimodal and generative AI in education. An extensive literature search yielded 4175 articles. Employing a topic modeling approach, latent topics were extracted, resulting in 38 interpretable topics organized into 14 thematic areas. Findings indicate a predominant focus on text-to-text models in educational contexts, with other modalities underexplored, overlooking the broader potential of multimodal approaches. The results suggest a research gap, stressing the importance of more balanced attention across different AI modalities and educational levels. In summary, this research provides an overview of current trends in generative AI for education, underlining opportunities for future exploration of multimodal technologies to fully realize the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in education.},

  abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.},

  abstract = {This study examines biases in the visual representation of individuals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields as generated by three generative AI systems: ChatGPT, Bing AI, and AI Art Generator. Using standardized prompts in a controlled experimental setup, we analyzed 296 AI-generated images. The results highlight significant gender and ethnic biases across all systems, especially in ChatGPT, where only 2.9\% of STEM-related images depicted women. Bing AI exhibited a more balanced gender distribution (64.6\% male, 35.4\% female). Additionally, most individuals in these images were represented as White, while other ethnic groups, especially Black individuals, had minimal representation. The analysis also revealed biases related to physical appearance, including body size, hair color, and facial hair, which often perpetuate idealized standards and stereotypes. For example, women were exclusively depicted as thin, and blond men were almost entirely absent. Contextual representation was also skewed, with women predominantly depicted in classroom settings rather than professional environments such as laboratories or workshops. These findings raise important questions regarding the role of generative AI in shaping social perceptions and cultural narratives. Beyond STEM, this study explores AI-generated imagery in historical and cultural depictions, questioning whether AI prioritizes diversity and inclusivity at the expense of historical accuracy. Through this discussion, we underscore the need for balanced representation in AI-generated content and recommend further research to refine these technologies. This would ensure that they responsibly reflect diversity without distorting historical or social realities.},

  abstract = {The internal structure and functions of the encoder and decoder of the Transformer model are reviewed, and the applications of self-attention mechanism, feed forward neural network, residual connection, and layer normalization are analyzed in the field of natural language processing. The Transformer model is introduced into machine translation as an engine, then the translation experiment is conducted, and the translation quality of the Transformer model is evaluated with the BLEU function. The findings reveal that, within the similar Transformer architecture, translations generated by GPT-4o as the translation engine exhibit higher quality compared to those produced by Youdao translation engine. However, the BLEU scores for both engines are relatively low, indicating a significant gap from the reference translation. This underscores the necessity for expert post-editing to further enhance quality, highlighting that human-machine interaction is currently an essential pathway for improving machine translation quality.},

  abstract = {In recent years, with the high speed development of generative models, the quality of the image generated by text-to-image model has been improved greatly. However, in actual production environment, the human's body in the image generated by current model still has big flaws. Distorted limbs and deformed facial features in the generated human images are one of the main problems faced by the text-to-image model. Despite the importance of this problem, there is still no dedicated benchmark for evaluating the quality of generated human limbs. To solve this problem, we first constructed a dataset related to the body mass of the people in the image using generative models with different performances. Then, based on this dataset, we trained a scoring model called BodyMetric based on ImageReward. After training the scoring model, we can theoretically perform quality assessment on larger data. We use the scores provided by the scoring model and the DPO reinforcement learning strategy on the sdxl model to improve sdxl's ability to generate human images. A large number of experiments have shown that our scoring model can give scores that are consistent with human preferences for the body quality of the people in the generated images. At the same time, other experiments have shown that the generative model trained based on our scoring model has a good performance in character generation.},

Through systematic evaluation by 30 nursery teachers using established pedagogical criteria, we identify significant differences in the models’ capabilities to create engaging, accurate, and developmentally appropriate content. Unexpectedly, Claude outperformed other models, particularly in biological topics, while all LLMs struggled with abstract chemical concepts. Our findings provide practical insights for educators leveraging AI in early science education and offer guidance for developers working to enhance LLMs’ educational applications. The results highlight the potential and current limitations of using LLMs to bridge the early science literacy gap.},

  abstract = {The use of mobile phone APP meter reading reduces the probability of human intervention and misidentification, but due to the complex location and geographical conditions of the buried water meter, as well as the base code and gear in the water meter dial, there are problems of low accuracy and rough segmentation results when the water meter word wheel region is divided, so a YOLO v8 segmentation method based on coordinate attention mechanism is proposed. The backbone network incorporates the AM (Attention-MobileNet_block) module to apply the Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism, which facilitates the extraction of multi-scale features, reduces model parameters and computational complexity, and enhances computing efficiency. In the feature fusion stage, the C2f_CA mechanism, based on the Bottleneck_CA module, effectively mitigates background interference while concentrating on the water meter's target region. Experimental results indicate that, compared to other segmentation models, our model achieves an F1-score of 98.61\% and a mean Pixel Accuracy (mPA) of 99.11\% for word wheel region segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the precise identification of water meter code words in the future.},

  abstract = {Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) is an emerging simulation paradigm that combines the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models with traditional Agent-Based Modeling to replicate complex social behaviors, including interactions on social media. While prior work has focused on localized phenomena such as opinion formation and information spread, its potential to capture global network dynamics remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing GABM-based social media simulations through the lens of the Friendship Paradox (FP), a counterintuitive phenomenon where individuals, on average, have fewer friends than their friends. We propose a GABM framework for social media simulations, featuring generative agents that emulate real users with distinct personalities and interests. Using Twitter datasets on the US 2020 Election and the QAnon conspiracy, we show that the FP emerges naturally in GABM simulations. Consistent with real-world observations, the simulations unveil a hierarchical structure, where agents preferentially connect with others displaying higher activity or influence. Additionally, we find that infrequent connections primarily drive the FP, reflecting patterns in real networks. These findings validate GABM as a robust tool for modeling global social media phenomena and highlight its potential for advancing social science by enabling nuanced analysis of user behavior.},

  abstract = {The emergence of generative AI has become a hot topic in academia and industry. Generative AI is also gradually becoming an interaction mode between enterprises and customers, improving customer experience and influencing their continued use intention. However, there is still uncertainty as to whether users are willing to use generative AI-driven products and services for a long time. Previous studies have mostly been based on traditional industries. How to enhance users’ continued use intention from the perspective of AI has become a widely concerned issue in academia and industry.Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Expectation Confirmation Theory (ECT), this study explores the impact of generative AI features on users’ continued use intention by improving the two paths of user perceived value and user satisfaction. 306 valid questionnaires were used, and SPSS 27.0 and SEM were used for data analysis and hypothesis testing. The results show that (1) generative AI features have a significant positive impact on users’ continued use intention; (2) user perceived value and user satisfaction play a mediating role in the relationship between generative AI features and users’ continued use intention. This finding improves users’ continued use intention of generative AI features, which is of great significance for understanding the marketing layout of generative AI for enterprises.},

  abstract = {Human-Computer Interaction practitioners have been proposing best practices in user interface design for decades. However, generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) brings additional design considerations and currently lacks sufficient user guidance regarding affordances, inputs, and outputs. In this context, we developed a recommender system to promote responsible AI (RAI) practices while people prompt GenAI systems, by recommending addition of sentences based on social values and removal of harmful sentences. We detail a lightweight recommender system designed to be used in prompting-time and compare its recommendations to the ones provided by three base large language models (LLMs) and two LLMs fine-tuned for the task, i.e., recommending inclusion of sentences based on social values and removal of harmful sentences from a given prompt. Results indicate that our approach has the best F1-score balance in terms of recommendations for additions and removal of sentences to promote responsible prompts, while a fine-tuned model obtained the best F1-score for additions, and our approach obtained the best F1-score for removals of harmful sentences. In addition, fine-tuned models improved the objectiveness of responses by reducing the verbosity of generated content in 93\% when compared to the content generated by base models. Presented findings contribute to RAI by showing the limits and bias of existing LLMs in terms of recommendations on how to create more responsible prompts and how open-source technologies can fill this gap in prompting-time.},

  abstract = {Context-aware AR instruction enables adaptive and in-situ learning experiences. However, hardware limitations and expertise requirements constrain the creation of such instructions. With recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), current research tries to tackle these constraints by deploying AI-generated content (AIGC) in AR applications. However, our preliminary study with six AR practitioners revealed that the current AIGC lacks contextual information to adapt to varying application scenarios and is therefore limited in authoring. To utilize the strong generative power of GenAI to ease the authoring of AR instruction while capturing the context, we developed CARING-AI, an AR system to author context-aware humanoid-avatar-based instructions with GenAI. By navigating in the environment, users naturally provide contextual information to generate humanoid-avatar animation as AR instructions that blend in the context spatially and temporally. We showcased three application scenarios of CARING-AI: Asynchronous Instructions, Remote Instructions, and Ad Hoc Instructions based on a design space of AIGC in AR Instructions. With two user studies (N=12), we assessed the system usability of CARING-AI and demonstrated the easiness and effectiveness of authoring with Gen-AI.},

  abstract = {Causal inference is the idea of cause and effect; this fundamental area of sciences can be applied to problem space associated with Newton’s laws or the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. The cause explains the “why,” whereas the effect describes the “what.” The domain itself encompasses a plethora of disciplines from statistics and computer science to economics and philosophy. Recent advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence systems have nourished a renewed interest in identifying and estimating the cause-and-effect relationship from the substantial amount of available observational data. This has resulted in various new studies aimed at providing novel methods for identifying and estimating causal inference. We include a detailed taxonomy of causal inference frameworks, methods, and evaluation. An overview of causality for security is also provided. Open challenges are detailed, and approaches for evaluating the robustness of causal inference methods are described. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey on such studies of causality. We provide an in-depth review of causality frameworks and describe the different methods.},

Furthermore, deep learning-based traffic image classification models often become overly complex in their pursuit of higher accuracy. In the paper, we propose a deep learning model-based method for the visual detection of DDoS malicious traffic. In response to the issue of model complexity, this article has made improvements based on the EfficientNet model, especially in resource constrained environments. This article introduces CBAM into the original model to improve its ability to process global information. By replacing the loss function in the final Softmax layer of the EfficientNet model, the ability to extract image features for binary classification problems has been enhanced, resulting in improved model performance. The experimental results show that this method can effectively identify various DDoS attacks. Compared with the EfficientNet model, this method has improved accuracy, training time, and single image prediction time.},

This paper presents an automated radiology report generation framework that combines Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) with a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to bridge AI performance with clinical explainability. CBMs map chest X-ray features to human-understandable clinical concepts, enabling transparent disease classification. Meanwhile, the RAG system integrates multi-agent collaboration and external knowledge to produce contextually rich, evidence-based reports. Our demonstration showcases the system’s ability to deliver interpretable predictions, mitigate hallucinations, and generate high-quality, tailored reports with an interactive interface addressing accuracy, trust, and usability challenges.

Key issues identified included increased plagiarism risk due to AI-generated unique code, accuracy and reliability concerns of AI outputs, privacy and data security risks, curriculum changes to incorporate prompt engineering and critical thinking, and challenges in traditional assessment methods. Additionally, the review highlighted the potential over-reliance on AI tools, which could hinder the development of fundamental programming skills. Implementation challenges and inadequate training for educators further complicate the integration process. Addressing these challenges is crucial for leveraging the benefits of AIGC tools while maintaining academic integrity and enhancing learning outcomes in programming education.

  abstract = {The release of popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT have prompted universities to introduce new policies or update existing ones. Currently, most institutions adapt their policies reactively as challenges arise, often without adopting a systematic framework, with minimal guidance and limited knowledge of the approaches taken by other institutions across the United States (U.S.). This study aims to bridge this gap by identifying core themes surrounding AI policies and guidelines across the top 50 U.S. universities. Given the labor- and time-intensive nature required to manually synthesize multiple policy documents across many institutions, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to identify common and prevalent themes. Our framework first summarizes AI policies at the institutional level, followed by the generation of multiple sets of themes through an iterative process of prompt chaining and self-refinement. Finally, the common themes from these distinct sets were consolidated. This framework is designed to address potential flaws in pre-trained LLMs, such as hallucinations. Seven distinct themes are uncovered: (1) academic integrity and responsible AI use, (2) communication of AI policies, (3) data privacy and security concerns, (4) ethical considerations in AI use, (5) continuous adaptation and policy evolution, (6) documentation and transparency in AI usage, and (7) instructor discretion in AI integration. Our work lays the foundation for future analyses or recommendations in developing comprehensive and equitable AI policies. Furthermore, leveraging LLMs allows us to respond swiftly to developments surrounding AI policies across universities.},

However, there is still a lack of in-depth exploration of the application of ChatGPT and other technologies in education, especially in areas such as personalized learning and precision teaching, the integration of virtual and actual teaching spaces, intelligent teaching facilities and resources, human-computer collaborative teaching methods, and interdisciplinary innovative research methods.We should actively respond to the opportunities and challenges brought by intelligent tools such as ChatGPT to higher education, and comprehensively and deeply explore how to integrate ChatGPT into key areas of digital education, including teaching design, teaching resource development, teaching organization and implementation, teaching evaluation and reflection, learning and personal knowledge management, innovation team building, and enhancing the digital literacy and professional capabilities of teachers and students. In addition, the impact of the application of ChatGPT and other technologies in education on educational equity, and how to ensure that all students can benefit from it through reasonable design and use, should also be of concern. The goal of this study is to further promote and drive the digital transformation of higher education by building a brand new higher education ecosystem based on ChatGPT.},

Utilizing GPT-4 to evaluate 1,022 core tasks across 51 public sector occupations, we provide an exploratory analysis of the roles susceptible to ChatGPT automation and those in which ChatGPT can augment human efforts. Our findings reveal that while 63\% of tasks are resistant to ChatGPT replacement, primarily due to their requirement for physical presence, emotional intelligence, and complex decision-making, tasks that are routine, rule-based, and involving basic content generation show a high potential for automation. The study also identifies key skills that will remain vital, those likely to become obsolete, and new skills that will emerge as essential, highlighting the need for a strategic approach to workforce development in the face of AI advancements. In particular, our findings underscore the growing importance of skills in applying AI technologies and the ability to validate and interpret AI-generated content for humans to remain competitive. We offer insights into public-sector-specific impacts and propose a methodological framework for future research, emphasizing the importance of adapting educational curricula and policies to prepare for an AI-integrated future.},

  abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) simplify complex learner data into accessible visualisations, providing actionable insights for educators and students. However, their educational effectiveness has not always matched the sophistication of the technology behind them. Explanatory and interactive LADs, enhanced by generative AI (GenAI) chatbots, hold promise by enabling dynamic, dialogue-based interactions with data visualisations and offering personalised feedback through text. Yet, the effectiveness of these tools may be limited by learners’ varying levels of GenAI literacy, a factor that remains underexplored in current research. This study investigates the role of GenAI literacy in learner interactions with conventional (reactive) versus scaffolding (proactive) chatbot-assisted LADs. Through a comparative analysis of 81 participants, we examine how GenAI literacy is associated with learners’ ability to interpret complex visualisations and their cognitive processes during interactions with chatbot-assisted LADs. Results show that while both chatbots significantly improved learner comprehension, those with higher GenAI literacy benefited the most, particularly with conventional chatbots, demonstrating diverse prompting strategies. Findings highlight the importance of considering learners’ GenAI literacy when integrating GenAI chatbots in LADs and educational technologies. Incorporating scaffolding techniques within GenAI chatbots can be an effective strategy, offering a more guided experience that reduces reliance on learners’ GenAI literacy.},

Despite this potential, AI adoption in air traffic control (ATC) has been limited, partly due to low user acceptance. This study, grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the AI Acceptance Model (AIAM), and the Technology Acceptance in the Working Environment (TAWE) model, investigates the factors influencing AI acceptance among ATCOs. Using data from an online survey of 83 ATCOS, our model explains 78.5\% of the variance in the intention to use AI. Notably, technology trust (TT) and emotion (EM) significantly influence the intention to use AI, with TT mediating the impact of perceived transparency (PT). Findings emphasize the need to address emotional and functional aspects to foster AI acceptance in ATC, marking a crucial step toward its improvement.},

This study explores how graduate students in an applied HCI course used GenAI tools during interactive device design. Despite no encouragement, all groups integrated GenAI into their workflows. Through 12 post-class group interviews, we identified how GenAI co-design behaviors present both benefits—such as enhanced creativity and faster design iterations—and risks, including shallow learning and reflection. Benefits were most evident during the execution phases, while the discovery and reflection phases showed limited gains. A taxonomy of usage patterns revealed that students’ outcomes depended more on how they used GenAI than the specific tasks performed. These findings highlight the need for HCI education to adapt to GenAI’s role and offer recommendations for curricula to better prepare future designers for effective creative co-design.},

  abstract = {The software engineering landscape is experiencing a significant transformation with the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools. While these tools promise to enhance programmer productivity, their impact on Time-Constrained Coding Challenges (TCCs), such as competitive programming, hackathons, and technical interviews remains poorly understood. TCCs are fundamental to both educational assessment and professional recruitment in software engineering. Integrating GenAI tools in these environments raises critical questions about skill development, assessment validity, and the nature of programming expertise. Current research lacks a systematic understanding of how GenAI tools influence programmer performance and learning outcomes in time-constrained environments. This gap is particularly concerning as educational institutions and industry organizations struggle to establish guidelines for GenAI use in TCCs. Without proper frameworks for integration, there are risks of: (1) Over-reliance on AI, potentially compromising fundamental skill development, and (2) Misalignment between traditional evaluation metrics and emerging co-intelligent programming practices. This doctoral research proposal aims to explore potential solutions for these issues.},

But exams do not afford more authentic programming experiences that involve planning, implementing, and debugging programs with computer interaction. In this experience report, we describe code interviews: a more authentic assessment method for take-home programming assignments. Through action research, we experimented with the number and type of questions as well as whether interviews were conducted individually or with groups of students. To scale the program, we converted most of our weekly teaching assistant (TA) sections to conduct code interviews on 5 major weekly take-home programming assignments. By triangulating data from 5 sources, we identified 4 themes. Code interviews (1) pushed students to discuss their work, motivating more nuanced but sometimes repetitive insights; (2) enabled peer learning, reducing stress in some ways but increasing stress in other ways; (3) scaled with TA-led sections, replacing familiar practice with an unfamiliar assessment; (4) focused on student contributions, limiting opportunities for TAs to give guidance and feedback. We reflect on the design of code interviews for student experience, academic integrity, and teacher workload.},

  abstract = {Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims to address incomplete facts in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). As a mainstream approach for KGC, text-based methods are limited in performance due to insufficient knowledge caused by constraints in fine-tuning data. To incorporate broader external knowledge, some researchers explored KGC approaches based on large language models (LLMs), but general-purpose LLMs lack direct awareness of knowledge graph domain knowledge, making it challenging for them to independently perform KGC tasks. To balance the dependence of text-based methods on knowledge graph domain knowledge and LLMs on external knowledge, we propose Collaborative Enhancement using Large Language Model for KGC (ColKGC). We define the prompt template to implement the interaction between the text-based model and the LLMs, and divide the knowledge graph completion process into two stages. In the concept enhancement stage, we supplement the fine-tuning data by interacting with the prompts of the LLMs to enrich the graph domain knowledge learned by the text-based model. In completion inference stage, we adopted the iterative interaction strategy, taking the text-based model output as the prompt and taking the interaction content of the previous stage as the context to enhance the inference, which improved the LLMs' understanding of the KGC task. Our experiments demonstrate that ColKGC achieves superior results across various standard knowledge graph benchmarks. Extensive experiments also bear out ColKGC's efectiveness in generated data and the iterative interaction framework in assisting LLMs reasoning.},

By introducing dual random phase encoding and leveraging the dual-chaotic system along with Arnold transformation, the authentication image is encrypted. The authentication and encrypted images are combined, and the dual-chaos system along with DNA dynamic encoding and computation methods are employed to perform encryption and decryption on the combined image, thereby achieving both image encryption and authentication. In the performance analysis of the encrypted images, the algorithm proposed in this paper not only provides authentication functionality but also demonstrates strong security, with advantages such as high decryption quality and fast encryption speed. Furthermore, its authentication feature makes it suitable for most encryption scenarios.},

Reviewing existing literature on AI applications in science, engineering, arts, and more, it brings forth unique contributions to progress in each area. This paper will research cross-national disparities in the development of AI talent, how educational policies, as well as industrial demands, impact training. A mixed-method approach is used in the analysis, with data and case studies from various countries to understand AI talent development. AI applications vary across countries and fields, exposing gaps in policy and education. Advanced countries invest in AI healthcare research to take the lead in sophisticated diagnostic systems. It is in developing countries where AI helps most: increased productivity in agriculture. The priority and resources will be dictated by local needs. Education and its resources and initiatives are in place for talent development, guiding policymakers and industry leaders on how to develop AI. This will develop the expertise necessary for advancing global AI technology. For example, in the area of education, enough resources can be put in place to ensure that students are abreast of state-of-the-art facilities and knowledge. Interdisciplinary initiatives, such as the integration of computer science with psychology or sociology, can yield a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between artificial intelligence and human behavior as well as social structures. By acknowledging these factors, it is essential to formulate strategies that foster an ecosystem conducive to the growth of AI expertise and propel international advancements in AI technology.},

However, practical obstacles remain, such as time constraints and students’ passive participation and the low quality of peer feedback. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been explored for its potential to automate grading and provide timely feedback, making it a valuable tool in formative assessment. Nevertheless, there is still limited research on how AI can be used effectively in the context of formative peer assessment. In this study, we conducted an AI-driven formative peer assessment with 108 secondary school students. During the peer assessment process, students not only evaluated peers’ responses and received peer-generated feedback, but also evaluated AI-generated responses and received AI-generated feedback. This research focused on analyzing the differences in preference between AI-generated and peer-generated feedback using trace data and dispositional data. In scenarios where student participation was low or the quality of peer feedback was insufficient, students showed a higher preference for AI-generated feedback, demonstrating its potential utility. However, students with high Math Confidence and AI Interest preferred peer-generated feedback. Based on these findings, we will propose practical strategies for implementing AI-driven formative peer assessment.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to design a chatbot application to help people find an appropriate restaurant based on users' preferences and transportation modes. It also aims to explore whether a machine learning-based chat agent is capable of accomplishing all the tasks precisely, or whether it could be optimized by collaborating with other simple agents. This paper establishes a chatbot environment along with a series of agents (machine learning agent, grammar checker agent, spelling checker agent, restaurant searcher), designed to assist users in finding a restaurant mainly based on what transportation they use and if a restaurant is found, the chatbot could display the route to this place in the prompt also with map details by employing the Google map API. The machine learning agent acting as the brain of this chatbot, could not only be able to evoke other agents corresponding to users’ input but also could directly store what kinds of transportation are taken by users and pass to Google map API to search appropriate restaurants instead of fully relying on a restaurant searcher agent (rule-based agent). To examine whether multiple agents coordinate with each other could outperform a single agent. A contrast experiment is conducted to conclude the result, which involves 15 participants who run through this program under two different setups (with and without spelling and grammar checkers) and each of them would give a query to this chatbot but this query would be dealt with and without spelling and grammar checker respectively. The result would be quantitatively evaluated by two metrics: Success Rate: successfully finding a restaurant and showing the map; the Total of Queries. Results suggest that pre-processing input with spelling and grammar checkers significantly improves the chatbot's performance, achieving an 80\% success rate (12 out of 15 queries). In contrast, when input is not pre-processed, the success rate drops to 46.66\% (7 out of 15 queries). This indicates that the involvement of spelling and grammar checker agents enhances the accuracy and efficiency of restaurant searches, making the collaborative multi-agent setup more effective. Moreover, it could demonstrate that this chatbot environment is well constructed since it could successfully provide suitable restaurants given users’ requirements.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the conceptual implementation of an application design, previously developed by communication design students. In an increasingly digitalised world, making cultural heritage accessible and approachable to diverse visitors is critical. The concept idea centres on an interactive video call with the patron of a Renaissance sandstone altar exhibited at the museum. The technical implementation includes generative AI tools for text, audio and animation production. Issues such as ensuring the accuracy of information, maintaining user privacy and preventing biases in AI-generated content are identified. The importance of co-creation with experts and adherence to ethical standards are highlighted to create a reliable educational tool. This implementation proposal forms the foundation for further development and future deployment as part of the museum’s permanent exhibition, aiming to transform how visitors experience and interact with cultural heritage artefacts.},

  abstract = {The widespread use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, has come along with multiple benefits in education (e.g., 24h teacher, augmenting student monitoring). However, at the same time, these tools hinder teachers’ autonomy, limiting the capacity and freedom to exert control over students’ actions and their learning process. Additionally, the generic character of the GenAI output usually lacks contextualization (e.g., course curriculum, students’ age), thus hampering the successful attainment of the course goals. To address these issues, this paper proposes the development of a system mediating between the GenAI interfaces and their back-ends. This system allows teachers to monitor the students’ interactions and align the given answers with the course learning objectives and teaching methods. This research follows the Systems Development Research methodology, and within the first iteration, we developed a system prototype that was evaluated with 8 secondary-school teachers. Results showed a high perceived usefulness of the system for monitoring students’ interactions; for alerting the teachers to take specific actions (e.g., suspicious copy-paste behaviours), and for having control over the GenAI outputs. Additionally, while most teachers perceived a higher autonomy level within the given scenarios, some teachers did not. The evaluation also served to collect further requirements and usability features to keep improving the tool in the next methodological iterations.},

By analyzing the demands of teachers and students, a resource optimization model centered on the trinity collaboration of "teacher - GenAI - student" is proposed. Teaching resources are scientifically divided, and a four-step dynamic process of "data collection - demand transformation - resource generation - application iteration" is designed. Taking the "Obstacle Avoidance Design of Intelligent Logistics Robots" project of the Python course in higher vocational education as a case for practical verification, the results show that students' mastery rate of sensor principles, code debugging efficiency, and ability of cross-scenario knowledge transfer have all improved. This model has achieved the transformation of teaching resources from supply-driven to demand-led by precisely matching the needs of teachers and students and dynamically optimizing the supply of resources, providing theoretical support and practical paths for the construction of the human-machine collaborative education ecosystem.},

Although deep learning-based medical image segmentation models have made significant progress in specific scenarios, they rely on static data distributions and struggle to handle dynamically changing clinical data, limiting the generalization ability of the model and making it susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, this paper proposes a combination of generative models and a continual learning framework, generating synthetic samples containing historical task features for data augmentation. Additionally, low-rank regularization and style-sharing parameter compression methods are employed to optimize storage requirements and improve the long-term stability and generalization ability of model. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the cardiac MRI and optic disc datasets.},

However, existing image-based methods generate results with blurred boundaries, graphic-based methods produce results with poor diversity, and rendering-based methods synthesize inconsistent images. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel controllable 3D urban generation pipeline, which consists of urban layouts and 3D scenes generation. Specifically, we introduce the graph dynamic attention model and the dummy node to enhance the diversity of the generated results. We also design a scene asset matching method based on the CLIP model to controllably generate 3D urban scenes. Experimental results indicate that the diversity of the generated results surpasses that of existing methods, and the generated 3D urban scenes are of good consistency.},

One avenue for an author to support their case for copyright protections over work created with AI may then be to demonstrate their intent to “predict” outputs of the generative AI tool during the creation process, shifting elements of randomness from the AI to the human’s own decision-making as much as possible. When this happens, the artist might claim to have expressed their idea with generative AI, and seek copyright protection for their work. We propose that generative AI co-creation tools can support this intention by keeping records of the predictability statistics at each generative AI iteration, and capturing the potential alternate options that can be later assessed for how predictably they matched the prompt.},

  abstract = {Knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILTs) typically require retrieving relevant documents from trustworthy corpora, e.g., Wikipedia, to produce specific answers. Very recently, a pre-trained generative retrieval model for KILTs, named CorpusBrain, was proposed and reached new state-of-the-art retrieval performance. However, most research on KILTs, including CorpusBrain, has predominantly focused on a static document collection, overlooking the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, where new documents are continuously being incorporated into the source corpus. To address this gap, it is crucial to explore the capability of retrieval models to effectively handle the dynamic retrieval scenario inherent in KILTs.In this work, we first introduce the continual document learning (CDL) task for KILTs and build a novel benchmark dataset named KILT++ based on the original KILT dataset for evaluation. Then, we conduct a comprehensive study of the use of pre-trained CorpusBrain on KILT++. Unlike the promising results in the stationary scenario, CorpusBrain is prone to catastrophic forgetting in the dynamic scenario, hence hampering retrieval performance. To alleviate this issue, we propose CorpusBrain++, a continual generative pre-training framework that enhances the original model along two key dimensions: (i) We employ a backbone-adapter architecture: the dynamic adapter is learned for each downstream KILT task via task-specific pre-training objectives; the backbone parameters that are task-shared are kept unchanged to offer foundational retrieval capacity. (ii) We use an experience replay strategy based on exemplar documents that are similar to new documents, to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old documents. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CorpusBrain++ in comparison to both traditional and generative information retrieval methods.},

To address this issue, we organized a collaborative workshop with four experts to brainstorm activities to teach AI to children. As a result, we developed Creat’AI — a GenAI-powered tangible prototype that co-creates original stories with children. We evaluated Creat’AI in a school with 17 children from the 1st grade. Our preliminary findings show that children were engaged in the activities and understood AI’s capability to generate original content, and changed their previous perception of AI and recognized that AI-generated content can be inaccurate. These results highlight the prototype’s potential in promoting AI literacy, contributing to the responsible and informed use of AI by young children.},

This paper presents the findings of a qualitative study that employed a provocative prototype ‘camera’ – the A(I)Cam – to engage creative practitioners directly in these discussions. Developed using a Research-through-Design (RtD) approach, the tangible prototype generates and instantly prints AI-created images. A(I)Cam facilitated reflection among creative practitioners (N=15) on their experiences with AI-driven tools and the broader implications for their future practices. We examine the shifts in perspective that emerged from engaging with this embodied form of generative AI (genAI), challenging traditional text-based interaction paradigms, and inviting new modes of creative exploration and reflection. In addition, we offer insights from the RtD project, highlighting the integration of genAI tools into the industrial design process.},

However, AI-generated images often lack cultural context, which risks cultural bias and the loss of cultural significance. This study explores the use of GAI in generating culturally meaningful patterns, focusing on Chinese intangible cultural heritage Huayao cross-stitch as a case study. By applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to optimize T2I tools and using in-situ interviews and focus groups, we collected feedback from 18 Huayao artisans. The results show that while fine-tuned models improved stylistic accuracy, the cultural meaning of the patterns remained insufficient. This research highlights AI's limited role in cultural innovation and emphasizes the necessity for dynamically maintaining cultural authenticity through the daily practices of cultural holders. It also reflects on how AI might have a long-term impact on the creative position of artisan communities.},

AI operates on the principle that “good things happen probabilistically,” while CPS adheres to the principle that “all bad things must not happen,” requiring uncertainty-awareness. Furthermore, the difference between AI’s resource accessibility assumption and CPS’s resource limitations highlights the need for resource-awareness. We introduce Cyber-Physical AI (CPAI), an interdisciplinary sub-field of AI and CPS research, to address these constraints. To the best of our knowledge, CPAI is the first research domain on CPS-AI integration. We propose a 3D classification schema of CPAI: Constraint (C), Purpose (P), and Approach (A). We also systematize the CPS-AI integration process into three phases and nine steps. By analyzing 104 studies, we highlight nine key challenges and insights from a CPAI perspective. CPAI aims to unify fragmented studies and provide guidance for reliable and resource-efficient integration of AI as a component of CPS.},

Survivability testing is usually implemented by simulating real hacker attacks, but this kind of testing and evaluation method depends on the professional level of testers to a large extent. There are problems such as incomplete testing and low testing efficiency. This paper comprehensively utilizes the ATT&amp;CK (Adversarial Tactics, Technologies, and Common Knowledge) and D3FEND (Defensive Tactics, Technologies, and Common Knowledge) frameworks of MITRE, aiming to propose a new cybersecurity survivability testing technology. Through in-depth analysis of the attack tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in the ATT&amp;CK framework, combined with the defense strategies and measures in the D3FEND framework, this paper designs a cybersecurity survivability evaluation program. This scheme not only evaluates the protection, detection, response and recovery capabilities of the system against network attacks, but also provides a scientific and perfect defense measures for the system. The case study further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and shows how to conduct survivability testing against attacks on the Linux operating system. This study provides a new perspective and practical guidance for the development of cybersecurity defense technology.},

The experimental results of DAT-YOLO on the VisDrone dataset show that with a 57.5\% reduction in parameter count, the mAP@50 and the mAP@50:95 has also increased by 6.7\% and 5.0\% respectively, making it suitable for drone target detection tasks.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is driving significant environmental impacts. The rapid development and deployment of larger algorithmic models consumes substantially more energy than traditional models, contributing to rising carbon emissions, water withdrawal, and e-waste generation. To mitigate these impacts, big tech companies are developing different strategies such as turning to nuclear energy to meet the demand for GenAI electricity and avoid carbon emissions, an approach that could have profound social and environmental implications beyond carbon reduction.This paper proposes a critical rethinking of GenAI’s proliferation through an ecofeminist framing, which has historically interrogated the role of science and technology in the context of gender and environmental justice. To do so, it introduces seven data ecofeminist principles delineating a pathway for developing technological and just transition alternatives within the AI research context, emphasising a critical examination of this technology’s role in the current socio-ecological crisis. The paper calls for an urgent reassessment of the GenAI innovation race, advocating for ecological and feminist technological projects that prioritise and respect life, people, and the planet.},

A vital enabler of its great success is the availability of abundant and high-quality data for building machine learning models. Recently, the role of data in AI has been significantly magnified, giving rise to the emerging concept of data-centric AI. The attention of researchers and practitioners has gradually shifted from advancing model design to enhancing the quality and quantity of the data. In this survey, we discuss the necessity of data-centric AI, followed by a holistic view of three general data-centric goals (training data development, inference data development, and data maintenance) and the representative methods. We also organize the existing literature from automation and collaboration perspectives, discuss the challenges, and tabulate the benchmarks for various tasks. We believe this is the first comprehensive survey that provides a global view of a spectrum of tasks across various stages of the data lifecycle. We hope it can help the readers efficiently grasp a broad picture of this field, and equip them with the techniques and further research ideas to systematically engineer data for building AI systems. A companion list of data-centric AI resources will be regularly updated on .},

This study explored how 165 educators designed and integrated 12,749 TLA in 218 LDs using clustering, pattern-mining, and correlational analysis. The findings suggest most educators use a combination of four common LD TLAs (i.e., Collaboration, Generating independent learning, Assessment, and Traditional classroom activities). The four common TLAs could be used to develop LA and Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) approaches to support educators in making more informed and evidence-based design decisions for effective learning and teaching.},

At the same time the descriptions of competences are mostly based on textual descriptions often in informal style targeted towards different audiences making descriptions vague and harder to compare. Formal models for the specification of competences exist for some time and even semantic models are being developed, e.g., the European Learning Model. These different approaches lead to a gap between formal and informal competence descriptions that require manual efforts of curriculum designer to maintain. This research borrows the concept of Deep and Surface representation models from the field of linguistics to unify the different approaches. Additionally, it focuses on the functionality of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the form of Large Language Models to close the aforementioned gap. It demonstrates the potential of the technology in both directions and discusses application potential of the concept.},

Next, the current situation of data representation and where it can be optimized are discussed. Then, after introducing the basic principles and variants of diverse DGM algorithms, the applications of these methods to design and optimize peptides are stated.

It helps achieve the teaching objectives of practical courses in a particular way. Today, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)—particularly large language models—are advancing rapidly. Now, it is particularly critical to study how to combine educational practices and GenAI in school education. This review mainly studies how to make academic strategies superior and more effective. It is recommended to use the A-CDIO educational paradigm. To put it simply, this is a student-centered CDIO framework that incorporates GenAI. The example of “particle effects” is used in teaching. The findings show that this innovative pattern works in actual teaching settings. It not only improves student learning outcomes significantly, but also improves the quality and efficiency of the entire education.},

  abstract = {The design of English teaching system based on artificial intelligence technology aims to solve the problems of insufficient training time and low efficiency in traditional English teaching. The research adopts advanced technologies such as intelligent speech recognition, natural language processing and machine learning to build an efficient and interactive learning environment. By integrating virtual reality and augmented reality technology, the system strengthens students' language application ability and encourages communication in simulated or actual contexts. The classroom teaching mode covers three stages: before class, during class and after class, to ensure the comprehensive improvement of students' listening and speaking skills. ITS module design includes student model, teacher model and expert model, which realizes the adjustment of personalized teaching content, evaluates learning results and provides targeted solutions. The realization of system functions depends on three core components: remote courseware service system, customer mobile learning system and data agent system, providing a stable and efficient personalized adaptive learning experience. The test results show that the system can still maintain high efficiency and stability when the number of concurrent users increases, which is superior to the traditional teaching system. In addition, intelligent composition correction, oral practice feedback, personalized learning plan recommendation and intelligent translation tools have significantly improved students' English writing ability and oral fluency.},

  abstract = {Industrial products are designed to satisfy the needs of consumers. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) enables consumers to easily modify a product by prompting a generative model, opening up opportunities to incorporate consumers in exploring the product design space. However, consumers often struggle to articulate their preferred product features due to their unfamiliarity with terminology and their limited understanding of the structure of product features. We present DesignFromX, a system that empowers consumer-driven design space exploration by helping consumers to design a product based on their preferences. Leveraging an effective GenAI-based framework, the system allows users to easily identify design features from product images and compose those features to generate conceptual images and 3D models of a new product. A user study with 24 participants demonstrates that DesignFromX lowers the barriers and frustration for consumer-driven design space explorations by enhancing both engagement and enjoyment for the participants.},

  abstract = {We are concurrently witnessing two significant shifts: voice and chat-based conversational user interfaces (CUIs) are becoming ubiquitous (especially more recently due to advances in generative AI and LLMs - large language models), and older people are becoming a very large demographic group (and increasingly adopting of mobile technology on which such interfaces are present). However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research.},

  abstract = {In this study, a rapid, accurate and intelligent method for detecting pesticide residues was developed by sensor arrays fused from surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) spectra of various substrates combined with deep learning. First, spectral data of pesticide residues were collected using conventional substrates with various morphologies. Then, the sensor array is acquired using different fusion methods on the spectral data, specifically concatenation and parallel methods. Finally, the intelligent and precise detection of chlormequat chloride and paraquat is implemented in a regression model constructed through the sensor array combined with machine learning and deep learning. In this experiment, the lowest detection limits for chlormequat chloride and paraquat detected are 0.03 mg/L and 0.003 mg/L, respectively. The regression model which was constructed using the sensor arrays obtained from the concatenation fusion method combined with the MobileNet obtained the best prediction results, with the coefficients of determination of prediction of 0.9865 and 0.9846 for chlormequat chloride and paraquat, and root-mean-square errors of prediction of 0.2254 and 0.0174, respectively. Overall, the method we proposed achieves rapid, intelligent and accurate detection of chlormequat chloride and paraquat, with the advantages of low cost and simple operation, which has great application potential in trace detection of pesticide residues.},

However, learning SDLC concepts presents unique challenges, such as the need for effective collaboration, real-time interaction, and access to diverse skill sets represented in software development teams. To address these problems, we present DevCoach, a generative AI powered multi-agent system designed to support students learning the SDLC. DevCoach allows students to interact with generative AI agents simulating the different roles in the software development team, engaging in tasks across different phases of SDLC. Through a user study (n = 20), we evaluate the system's effectiveness in enhancing learning, impact on SDLC deliverables, and support for Community of Inquiry (CoI) elements necessary for effective and supportive learning environments. Our results reveal that students using DevCoach achieved significantly higher learning gains and improved task completion rates across all SDLC phases. The system also supports CoI elements, particularly perceived social presence. Participants also lauded the immediate context-aware feedback, interactive learning environment, and diverse expertise provided by the roles within the multi-agent team. These findings demonstrate the potential of generative AI to enhance software engineering education by making it more effective, engaging, and interactive, providing students with collaborative and practical learning experiences.},

These tools promise productivity gains and support for various tasks, from code generation to explain legacy systems. However, their integration into education raises pedagogical challenges: How can we use their potential without compromising students' autonomy and mastery of fundamental concepts? How can we stay critical of their limitations?This paper explores these questions through a structured educational experience. It is based on a guided tutorial designed to confront students with the assistants' limitations. A simultaneous questionnaire is provided to allow students to take the necessary time to thoroughly analyze the assistant's responses. The tutorial has three stages. It introduces students to real-world scenarios of increasing complexity: getting started, implementing business rules, and working on a legacy project.This approach helps develop skills such as critical thinking, prompt refinement, and error correction. The results also show that well-supervised use of coding assistants can enhance teaching in testing and working with legacy code. They help students overcome initial roadblocks and encourage them to think about best practices. Furthermore, students themselves highlight the importance of supervising these tools to maintain their autonomy.},

Taking the course of Python Programming as an example, the teaching practice is carried out. The findings demonstrate that the approach considerably enhances students' overall computational thinking skills, particularly in task decomposition, algorithm design, and assessment reflection, and lessens the complexity of problem comprehension and program development.

The system adopts lightweight MTCNN and MobileFaceNet algorithms to dynamically bind the identities of children and adults by generating unique ID codes (timestamp + random six-digit number). During entry, an adult generates an ID code via face detection and associates it with the child's information. During exit, a child can only pass if their ID code matches the associated adult's ID. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a recognition accuracy of 99.93\%, a single binding time of 2.8 seconds, and a database response time of less than 10 ms under high concurrency (1000 QPS). This system enables accurate guardianship without pre-registration and effectively reduces the risk of children getting lost or being taken by unauthorized individuals.},

The model achieved an impressive 93.54\% accuracy in detecting all 11 types of algae, ensuring reliable results. Additionally, the system reduced the counting time by 94.44\%, with an average image processing time of approximately 0.6 seconds, a significant improvement compared to the manual visual inspection time of 10.8 seconds per grid.

  abstract = {Silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives (SiPSAs) have demonstrated broad application potential in electronics and other fields due to their exceptional properties, such as temperature resistance, weather resistance, and chemical corrosion resistance. However, traditional SiPSAs are predominantly thermally cured solvent-based products, which not only exhibit slow curing rates but also release harmful solvents like toluene during application, causing environmental pollution. To address this issue, this study Under the background of artificial intelligence. synthesized thiol-functionalized MTQ silicone resins (MTQ-SH) with various M/(T+Q) ratios using γ-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, tetraethyl orthosilicate, and hexamethyldisiloxane as raw materials. These resins were then photo-crosslinked with vinyl-terminated silicone oil to prepare UV-curable silicone PSAs (UV-SiPSAs). The results revealed that the optimal precursor ratio for UV-SiPSA preparation was M/T/Q = 1.00/0.21/1.58. When the photoinitiator TPO-L was added at 1 wt.\% and the molar ratio of thiol groups to vinyl end groups was 1.2:1, the resulting UV-SiPSA exhibited an initial adhesion strength capable of holding a 22# steel ball and a holding time of 230 minutes at 25℃. This UV-curable PSA shows promising potential for replacing traditional thermally cured silicone PSAs in the protective film industry.},

  abstract = {This study evaluates the consistency between an AI system and traditional doctor diagnoses in detecting heart sound abnormalities, and explores the impact of noise reduction technology on AI performance in noisy environments. Methods: Stage 1: AI and doctor diagnoses were compared in detecting single and multiple heart sound abnormalities using a deep neural network (DNN) model. Performance was measured by Cohen's Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. Stage 2: Noise reduction technology was applied to assess its effect on AI performance in high-noise environments, using frequency-domain filtering, CNNs, and metrics like the Noise Impact Index (NII) and Noise Reduction Rate (NRR). Results: In Stage 1, the AI showed high consistency with doctors for single abnormalities (Cohen's Kappa = 0.81), but underperformed for multiple abnormalities. It achieved 96\% sensitivity, 93\% specificity, and an F1 score of 0.89, though performance was affected by noise. In Stage 2, noise reduction significantly improved AI accuracy, particularly in detecting multiple abnormalities, where AI outperformed doctors. Conclusion: The AI system demonstrated strong agreement with doctors, especially in detecting single abnormalities. Noise reduction technology enhanced its diagnostic accuracy and stability, particularly in complex environments. Further optimization is needed for more comprehensive performance in diverse cases.},

  abstract = {Deepfakes have posed significant risks to personal privacy and reputation. At present, active defense measures often introduce imperceptible adversarial perturbations into the protected images, aiming to disrupt the normal forgery of deepfake models. Among them, generative perturbations are favored because of their higher efficiency. However, the existing generative perturbations are mainly based on the Lp-norm method, which still has the problem of high perception and difficulty in achieving personalized strength. To address this shortcoming, we propose an adaptive deepfake adversarial perturbation generation method based on a diffusion model. Initially, our approach constructs an adversarial denoising framework that utilizes the reverse process of diffusion model to learn unrestricted perturbations. Then an adversarial guided mechanism is introduced during the sampling stage, enabling the adaptive control of the adversarial perturbation through sampling step and guidance strength. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves effective defense effects on various typical deepfake models and has good adaptive generation capabilities.},

  abstract = {Disaster digital archives play a crucial role in preserving and disseminating data on various natural disasters. To manage these archives effectively, images need to be tagged appropriately and comprehensively, and machine learning is expected to handle this task efficiently. However, existing machine-learning tagging models fail to extract detailed disaster-related information. This study focuses on extracting disaster-specific tags from images using the latest machine-learning techniques.More specifically, we use generative AI to create descriptions of images and extract tags from these descriptions, allowing for more detailed information retrieval compared to traditional tags. By including prior information that the images are disaster-related in the prompts, we aim to achieve more specialized disaster tagging.Qualitative evaluation results suggest that the proposed method extracts more disaster-related tags than existing tagging models, indicating that it provides effective tags for users searching disaster images. This study applies real-world test cases using images from the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake.},

  abstract = {Our research investigates the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models, specifically text-to-image generators (T2Is), on the representation of non-Western cultures, with a focus on Indian contexts. Despite the transformative potential of T2Is in content creation, concerns have arisen regarding biases that may lead to misrepresentations and marginalizations. Through a Non-Western community-centered approach and grounded theory analysis of 5 focus groups from diverse Indian subcultures, we explore how T2I outputs to English input prompts depict Indian culture and its subcultures, uncovering novel representational harms such as exoticism and cultural misappropriation. These findings highlight the urgent need for inclusive and culturally sensitive T2I systems. We propose design guidelines informed by a sociotechnical perspective, contributing to the development of more equitable and representative GAI technologies globally. Our work underscores the necessity of adopting a community-centered approach to comprehend the sociotechnical dynamics of these models, complementing existing work in this space while identifying and addressing the potential negative repercussions and harms that may arise as these models are deployed on a global scale.},

We conducted a probe-based, group autoethnography study to explore how dream sharing was influenced in the way of relay and with GAI. Results showed how participants recorded their dreams and perceived the AI-generated dream visuals. This study also highlighted the value of GAI in sparking imagination and alleviating personal privacy concerns, which increased the willingness to share. Finally, we discussed the human-AI collaboration in reshaping dreams, as well as the role of GAI in facilitating social interaction.},

  abstract = {In scenarios with fixed time intervals, discrete-time dynamic graph (DTDG) is used to represent dynamic networks, such as social networks, traffic networks and biological networks. Existing models introduce self-attention mechanism for structural representation learning on discrete-time dynamic graph and demonstrate good performance in this field. However, temporal encoder in these models focuses on the entire time domain, introducing noise and limiting the model's ability to extract critical information. To address this issue, we propose the DyLF model based on Longformer mechanism. By incorporating the Longformer-based self-attention mechanism, DyLF can flexibly adjust the range of visible time domain while encoding temporal features of nodes in dynamic graphs and efficiently capture temporal dependencies between snapshots, thereby enhancing the ability to extract more effective temporal information. Extensive experiments show that DyLF achieves an average improvement of 4.28\% in AUC and 6.87\% in F1_score with the existing baseline, demonstrate that it is better suited for handling DTDGs.},

  abstract = {Despite significant advancements in multi-agent systems, solving the optimal path problem and addressing incomplete information remain challenging in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Traditional MARL algorithms often struggle with these two critical issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework called DDCF(Dynamic Decision Correction Framework) that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to optimize the decision-making process for agents navigating complex environments. The first key innovation of this framework is the application of LSTM networks, which enable agents to learn optimal paths over time while considering dynamic, temporal dependencies within the environment. The second key innovation is the introduction of a dynamic decision-making approach, which effectively handles the problem of incomplete information by enabling agents to make decisions based on both observable and inferred states. This decision method ensures that agents can intelligently handle uncertain environments by incorporating both certain and fuzzy information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of path optimization and decision-making performance, providing a robust solution for agents in environments characterized by incomplete information and complex decision tasks.},

  abstract = {Traditional imaging examinations, blood tests, and biomarker tests often have problems with insufficient sensitivity and specificity. To this end, this paper focuses on artificial intelligence, especially the application of Deep Learning (DL) models in CT (computed tomography) image analysis and diagnosis, and explores its potential in early cancer detection. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to tumor detection in CT images. First, the image data is standardized, including resizing and normalization, to make sure that the input data is consistent, and more training samples are generated through methods for augmenting data (e.g., cropping, flipping, rotation, etc.) to enhance the model's capacity for generalization. The CNN model is primarily composed of convolutional layers, layers that pool together, fully linked layers, and functions for activation. The convolutional layers automatically extract low-level features (such as edges, textures, etc.) in the image through local receptive fields, and the pooling layers further reduce the feature dimension and enhance the model's anti-noise ability. Finally, the experimental data show that the method in this paper achieves an accuracy of 96.63 and a prediction time of 1.81 seconds, which is almost comparable to that of the professional doctor, but it is substantially shorter in prediction time.},

  abstract = {The basic purpose of copyright is to protect economic and moral rights. Economic rights allow the rights owners to derive financial rewards from monetizing their works. In contrast, moral rights allow the creators to be acknowledged and to take certain actions to preserve and protect the integrity of their works. Both rights are conventionally granted to human and legal entities. However, the massive advancement of AI challenges the essential presumption that technology is merely a device in the hands of humans in the creation process of Work. This paper examines several legal issues and problems concerning the economic and moral rights of AI-generated works using the juridical normative approach from the perspective of Indonesian Copyright Law. The result shows that the framework of Indonesia's copyright law is based on the principle of human authorship, therefore, moral rights can only be granted to human(s) and economic rights can only be granted to legal subjects acknowledged by Indonesian Law: human and legal entity. Although the authorship and ownership of AI for copyrighted work is contentious under Indonesian Laws, the limited legal personality of AI could potentially artifice as the preventive measures on several problems concerning legal standing by enabling legal subject (human or legal entity) to act behalf of AI to exercise their rights and obligation both based on regulative approach and procedural approach.},

  abstract = {Socio-technological developments are driving the profound impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on education. Driven by the “disruptive technology revolution” in different fields, AI is reshaping knowledge acquisition, teaching and learning, from personalized learning systems to the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the traditional “factory” mode of education is difficult to adapt to personalized learning development needs. Learning development needs, and artificial intelligence-driven systems in support of adaptive learning, intelligent tutoring and automatic assessment, in addition to greatly improve the learning efficiency “liberation of productivity”, but also to change the way of knowledge transfer, affect human cognition and independent learning. It is foreseeable that the competition for education in the age of artificial intelligence may shift from knowledge accumulation to computational power domination. That is to say, individuals with more computing power will have access to better learning resources, which will definitely increase the “digital education gap” on the other hand. This paper analyzes the current situation, challenges, and future trends of AI in education, and explores the impact of AI on self-directed learning, cognitive processes, and the possible evolution of education towards computational competitiveness. Using research methods such as literature review, case study, and technology trend prediction, this study combines the theories of cognitive science, philosophy of AI, and pedagogy to assess the educational impact of AI and propose policy recommendations to promote equity and optimize AI cooperation.},

  abstract = {Emotional recognition can help machines to capture the emotional state of human beings, which is an indispensable technology for human-computer interaction and the realization of artificial intelligence. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been applied to emotion recognition due to its good temporal and spatial resolution. How to capture the correlation of long-distance time-series EEG signal data from both temporal and spatial dimensions and directly affect the effect of emotion recognition is a difficulty in the BCI research. Transformer model can extract long-term correlations of time-series signals. In this paper, a new electroencephalogram emotion recognition method based on spatiotemporal fusion Vision Transformer is proposed. The feature of EEG signals is reconstructed by the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) method. The spatiotemporal correlation between the acquisition channel and the temporal signal is established by position coding for the convolved features. The hybrid model of multiscale convolutional and Vision Transformer (MC-ViT) is utilized for feature extraction and emotion classification. The EEG emotion recognition method based on spatio-temporal fusion vision transformer proposed in this paper has achieved good EEG emotion classification effect on the SEED dataset, which outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods.},

  abstract = {Simulation-based testing is widely used to assess the reliability of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), but its effectiveness is limited by the operational design domain (ODD) conditions available in such simulators. To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then performed system-level testing to evaluate the ability of the ADS to generalize to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help to increase the coverage of ODD for system-level ADS testing. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3\%, retaining the correctness and quality of the images generated for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing.},

However, existing methods often neglect rich intent utilization, limiting the generative capabilities of LLMs. To address this, we propose an &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;nd-to-End &lt;u&gt;G&lt;/u&gt;enerative framework for learning rich &lt;u&gt;Rec&lt;/u&gt;ommendation intents with LLMs, termed EGRec. EGRec employs a joint training paradigm for LLMs and CTR models, where LLMs generate rich user intents that are integrated into CTR models to enhance recommendation accuracy. By combining LLMs' semantic understanding with CTR models' predictive analytics, EGRec improves overall recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on the Amazon-Book dataset and proprietary Industrial-Ads data demonstrate EGRec's superiority over robust baseline methods.},

Afterward, five examples were correlated to influence the design of an immersive and responsive 360° theatre system using specific combinations of artificial intelligence models to aid subjective recall. In this immersive space, storyteller preferences for edited content are finally made available for new users, thereby affording new collaborative storytelling about a cultural heritage site.

  abstract = {Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and interpretability.In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation. Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing, perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role specialization and price fluctuations in line with market rules.},

  abstract = {This paper first conducts a regression analysis on the direct effect of artificial intelligence on the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry, and then uses the panel threshold model to explore the threshold effect of artificial intelligence on the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. The Hausman test confirms the rationality of the fixed effect regression model, indicating that artificial intelligence has a significant positive impact on the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. Subsequently, the panel threshold model is used for analysis, and it is found that there is a double threshold effect, with the first threshold value being 6.5575 and the second being 14.4800. The marginal effect of the improvement of artificial intelligence level on high-quality development shows a rapid increase at first, a slowdown after crossing the first threshold, and an acceleration again after crossing the second threshold. This nonlinear relationship is further verified through the adjustment ratio change and internal validity test for robustness. The results show that high-end and low-end manufacturing enterprises are more likely to benefit from artificial intelligence technology due to advantages in cost-effectiveness, market demand, and technological adaptability, thereby promoting their high-quality development. In contrast, mid-range manufacturing enterprises may face a series of challenges, resulting in less significant or even inhibitory effects of artificial intelligence technology on them.},

  abstract = {Due to the limited availability of actual large-scale datasets, realistic synthetic trajectory data play a crucial role in various research domains, including spatiotemporal data mining and data management, and domain-driven research related to transportation planning and urban analytics. Existing generation methods rely on predefined heuristics and cannot learn the unknown underlying generative mechanisms. This work introduces two end-to-end approaches for trajectory generation. The first approach comprises deep generative VAE-like models that factorize global and local semantics (habits vs. random routing change). We further enhance this approach by developing novel inference strategies based on variational inference and constrained optimization to ensure the validity of spatiotemporal aspects. This novel deep neural network architecture implements generative and inference models with dynamic latent priors. The second approach introduces a language model (LM) inspired generation as another benchmarking and foundational approach. The LM-inspired approach conceptualizes trajectories as sentences with the aim of predicting the likelihood of subsequent locations on a trajectory, given the locations as context. As a result, the LM-inspired approach implicitly learns the inherent spatiotemporal structure and other embedded semantics within the trajectories. These proposed methods demonstrate substantial quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing approaches, as evidenced by extensive experimental evaluations.},

However, many existing methods face issues, such as insufficient use of overall context and difficulty in extracting key features due to noise interference. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a model called GC-DMRec. This model combines global context with gated slot attention mechanisms, effectively integrating local session graphs with global context graphs to track item changes both within and across sessions. By using gated slot attention, GC-DMRec focuses on critical time points, extracting more representative features while reducing noise. Experimental results on datasets such as Diginetica, Tmall, and Nowplaying demonstrate that GC-DMRec outperforms other existing methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners. It is frequently used to address major security problems such as supply chain attacks, ransomware threats, and social engineering. In this context, integrating AI into cybersecurity workflows requires incorporating AI-driven approaches into the educational training of the cybersecurity workforce. This paradigm shift in academic settings will introduce the necessary skills for cybersecurity professionals to operate modern AI-based systems. Yet, the current cybersecurity curriculum still suffers from the absence of AI resources, particularly the detailed understanding of the appropriate AI mechanisms. Such absence leaves skill gaps for future professionals and practitioners in the industry. To address this, we designed an academic lecture module on AI covering both theory and practice. Then, we taught the module across six cybersecurity courses in our institution. To assess the effectiveness of integrating AI materials into cybersecurity education, we collected data by presenting two surveys before and after the lecture (concluding 81 participants per survey). Specifically, we utilized widely accepted models for unbiased analysis of our data. Our experimental results show positive AI knowledge improvement by 30\% of the participants, demonstrating the beneficial impact of the lecture. Then, we observed a high similarity score between the survey responses and the lecture content, reaching 84\%. Moreover, our sentiment analysis results reflect positive feedback from the participants with a positive score of 0.50. Overall, our study serves as a reference for instructional designers for developing educational curricula aiming to integrate AI into cybersecurity education.},

This paper presents an optimized generative AI framework that integrates OpenAI's LLMs with OpenFace to improve the mapping between blendshapes (or morph targets) and facial action units (standardized facial muscle movements defined by Facial Action Coding System) for dynamic facial expressions. The system, embedded in an original game scene, generates facial expressions based on interactive player dialogues. From a software engineering perspective, it features modular, scalable AI-driven animation pipelines that support adaptive emotion modeling and game engine integration. User evaluations demonstrate high realism, clear emotion recognition, and strong engagement, confirming the system's potential to enhance player interaction. Further refinements in blendshape mappings and real-time adjustments can enhance the differentiation of subtle emotions like Disgust and Contempt, improving the system's overall expressiveness.},

This paper aims to explore how generative AI can enhance user experience by augmenting graphic art style game design. Through the study of design theories, those theories that have a strong influence on graphic art style games are identified. Next, the paper proposes a generative AI-based game design method that combines prompts confirmation, the setting of generated images, and user feedback optimization, aiming to enhance the aesthetic quality and interactivity of the game. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, this paper designs and implements an interview method and a questionnaire to collect data and find out the user experience of generative AI-generated graphic art style games. The experimental results show that generative AI not only significantly improves the efficiency of game design, but also allows for innovative graphics and element design. The findings of this paper provide new perspectives and methods for the application of AI in future game design and also lay the foundation for further exploring the potential of generative AI in other art style games.},

  abstract = {Smart contracts, self-executing agreements on the blockchain, have emerged as a transformative force in blockchain technology, automating agreements and enabling decentralized applications. However, the stakes are extraordinarily high—manual coding errors in smart contracts have repeatedly led to financial losses. Notable incidents, such as the DAO hack that resulted in a loss of approximately $50 million [36] and the Parity wallet vulnerability that froze approximately $280 million in assets [45], underscore the immense economic risks involved. To support manual development tasks, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) powered by large language models (LLMs) have transformed how software is developed and maintained by automating various software engineering tasks.This research explores the capabilities of generative AI tools for efficient and secure smart contract development. The methodology involves two phases: 1) we distribute a mixed methods survey for blockchain and smart contract developers (n = 114) to investigate their perspectives towards utilizing LLMs; and 2) we evaluate the effectiveness of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and ChainGPT, for smart contract development. This evaluation is based on comparing the LLM-generated smart contract code with human-written code, using a diverse dataset of smart contracts gathered from GitHub. Static analysis tools and unit testing are employed to validate the accuracy, correctness, efficiency, and security of the generated code. Our findings highlight the potential of these tools to accelerate smart contract development processes, while also emphasizing the need for human oversight, contributing to the advancement of blockchain technology and its applications.},

  abstract = {Topological tools have become popular in improving and evaluating the performance of generative models by exploring the connection between their representation power and topological properties. This has led to the development of various measures that can assess the diversity and quality of generated data. However, existing methods are impractical in higher dimensions and large-scale datasets/models. To address this, we propose a scalable framework based on persistent entropy. We first establish a theoretical relation between the homological complexity of the underlying topology and the persistent entropy. We then empirically study the topological transformation during training of the generated data manifold using cubical homology. The proposed method is domain \&amp; model-agnostic and scales well for various neural architectures at different depths.},

This paper focuses on the study of factors affecting design behavior in the view of artificial intelligence, aiming to analyze the weight of each influencing factor accurately. Through the hierarchical analysis method (AHP), its advantage of quantitative subjective judgment is brought into play, and experts' subjective perception of the importance of design behavior factors is deeply explored. At the same time, combined with the entropy weight method, the weights are determined based on the objective information entropy of the data, which effectively makes up for the lack of subjective assignment. Using the AHP-entropy weight method combined with these two methods, a comprehensive and systematic weight evaluation of design behavior factors is carried out to improve the efficiency of multi-attribute decision-making.},

Through interviews with 20 blind screen reader users who use various GenAI applications for diverse tasks, we show how they approached information access with everyday uncertainty, or a mindset of skepticism and criticality towards both AI- and human-mediated assistance as well as information itself. Instead of expecting information to be ‘correct’ and ‘complete’, participants extracted cues from error-prone information sources; treated all information as tentative; acknowledged and explored information subjectivity; and constantly adjusted their expectations and strategies considering the politics around access. The concept of everyday uncertainty situates GenAI tools among the interconnected assistive applications, humans, and sociomaterial conditions that both enable and hinder the ongoing production of access. We discuss the implications of everyday uncertainty for future design and research.},

A study investigating students' attitudes toward these tools was conducted during an Introduction to Computer Science course. The target of the study was to gauge students' evolving attitudes toward using GenAI tools in the course, before, during and after ChatGPT was gradually assimilated into homework assignments. The study refers to three phases: preliminary phase, assimilation phase, and calibration stage, which currently takes place. Findings show that, in the preliminary phase, students appreciated the efficiency of GenAI tools offered but were concerned about developing a dependency on these tools and about ''cheating''. Findings from the assimilation phase indicate that consistent, guided exposure to GenAI tools positively shifted students' views, alleviating initial concerns and promoting a positive attitude toward using GenAI tools in the course. The targets of the calibration phase are: a) to examine how to leverage independent learning by formulating clear guidelines that can build trust in the technology and help overcome concerns regarding reliability and credibility; b) to check how GenAI can help students in a Introduction to Computer Science course acquire skills such as critical thinking and code comprehension. The study offers insights for educators on the integration of GenAI tools into computer science courses to enhance learning while maintaining academic integrity.},

Recognized for their cutting-edge language processing capabilities, these excel in generating human-like conversations, enabling open-ended dialogues with end-users. We consider that the future adoption of generative AI for critical public domain applications transforms the accountability relationship. Previously characterized by the relationship between an actor and a forum, the introduction of generative systems complicates accountability dynamics as the initial interaction shifts from the actor to an advanced generative system. We conceptualise a dual-phase accountability relationship involving the actor, the forum, and the generative AI as a foundational approach to understanding public sector accountability in the context of these technologies. Focusing on integrating generative AI for assisting healthcare triaging, we identify potential challenges introduced for maintaining effective accountability relationships, highlighting concerns that these technologies relegate actors to a secondary phase of accountability and creates a disconnect between government actors and citizens. We suggest recommendations aimed at disentangling the complexities generative systems bring to the accountability relationship. As we speculate on the technologies’ disruptive impact on accountability, we urge public servants, policymakers, and system designers to deliberate on the potential accountability impact generative systems produce prior to their deployment.},

To address this gap, we conducted an online survey (n=97) and interviews with fifteen college students followed by interviews with nine teachers who had experience with students’ undisclosed use of GenAI. Our findings elucidate the strategies students employ to hide their GenAI use and their justifications for doing so, alongside the strategies teachers follow to manage such non-disclosure.

This study conducts the first comprehensive evaluation of diffusion models for reconstructing incomplete trace event sequences. Using nine distinct datasets generated from the Phoronix Test Suite, we rigorously test these models on sequences of varying lengths and missing data ratios. Our results indicate that the SSSDS4 model, in particular, achieves superior performance, in terms of accuracy, perfect rate, and ROUGE-L score across diverse imputation scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of diffusion-based models to accurately reconstruct missing events, thereby maintaining data integrity and enhancing system monitoring and analysis.},

To explore visitors’ experience with it, we conducted a field experiment (N=30) at the National Art Museum, comparing it to the existing museum application.

Moreover, they enjoyed an interactive experience using the chatbot to learn about the art collection and have equally preferred textual and auditory information representation.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology intended to imitate human intelligence, enabling effective problem-solving abilities, and it has been recognized as a key area of computer science. AI-based applications have grown exponentially across various everyday domains over the last ten years, encompassing medicine and healthcare. The initial release of ChatGPT in the latter half of 2022 propelled AI to the center of public attention, leading to widespread recognition of its capabilities. The rapid integration of AI in healthcare applications has sparked major concerns regarding their ability to generate an interpretable and accurate model for clinical decisions. This requirement for transparency and trust in healthcare AI-based applications has led to the development of Explainable AI (XAI). XAI refers to a collection of techniques and approaches employed by AI applications to transparently explain how they arrived at their decisions and understand why they made that specific prognosis. Though there are numerous surveys conducted for the XAI applications in the healthcare field, the main aim of this study is to present a survey that summarizes various XAI methodologies and illustrates the techniques employed to enhance interpretability in machine learning (ML) models that apply to the disciplines of neuroscience and cardiology, with the intent of enhancing decision-making in clinical AI-based models. Following a comprehensive research study, we carefully filtered and reviewed 25 research articles that cover several XAI techniques that are applied in cardiology and neuroscience applications to enhance their interpretability. According to our analysis, the SHAP method appears to be the most popular method of explainability among the reviewed studies. In addition, we provide future research initiatives to tackle the major challenges and limitations of XAI applications.},

In the medical realm, AI takes a pivotal role, leveraging robust machine learning (ML) algorithms. AI technology in medical imaging aids physicians in X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnoses, conducts pattern recognition and disease prediction based on acoustic data, delivers prognoses on disease types and developmental trends for patients, and employs intelligent health management wearable devices with human-computer interaction technology to name but a few. While these well-established applications have significantly assisted in medical field diagnoses, clinical decision-making, and management, collaboration between the medical and AI sectors faces an urgent challenge: How to substantiate the reliability of decision-making? The underlying issue stems from the conflict between the demand for accountability and result transparency in medical scenarios and the black-box model traits of AI. This article reviews recent research grounded in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), with an emphasis on medical practices within the visual, audio, and multimodal perspectives. We endeavor to categorize and synthesize these practices, aiming to provide support and guidance for future researchers and healthcare professionals.},

  abstract = {Exploration and Optimization are ubiquitous activities in human work. Exploration allows us to consider multiple design or solution possibilities. Optimization allows us to narrow and refine diverse possibilities. Given that generative AI produces diverse outcomes for the same input – an attribute known as generative variability – there is now a need to re-examine Exploration and Optimization in the context of generative AI and understand their implications for the future of work. The relationship between Exploration and Optimization has traditionally been portrayed as independent, inverse, or even contradictory. Guided by concepts from mixed initiative interfaces, we conducted a conceptual analysis of three future-work-centered generative AI use cases. We show that the relationship between Exploration and Optimization is not “one-size fits all.” We show how Exploration and Optimization may be combined into several integrated and inter-dependent work processes. Our use cases indicate that generative variability will increase the importance of Exploration and Optimization in future work tasks and applications.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of the “Made in China 2025” strategy, the contradiction in talent supply in the field of industrial robots is prominent. The traditional training model has problems such as a lagging curriculum system, insufficient practical training equipment, and a single evaluation system. The development of artificial intelligence technology has brought new opportunities to the teaching of industrial robot courses and constructed a blended teaching model. This model encompasses the construction of the core parameter system for industrial robots and the architecture of an intelligent teaching platform. Teaching practices are carried out through methods such as “online theoretical foundation - virtual simulation pre-training - offline practical operation deepening”. Practice shows that the blended teaching mode is significantly superior to the traditional teaching mode in multiple dimensions such as the compliance rate of industrial applicability, practical operation efficiency, and recognition accuracy. However, this teaching mode is confronted with challenges such as difficulties in updating teaching resources, insufficient interdisciplinary ability of teachers, significant differences in students' learning autonomy, and insufficient depth of school-enterprise cooperation. To this end, countermeasures need to be taken in aspects such as resource construction, improvement of teachers' capabilities, student management and deepening of school-enterprise cooperation to promote high-quality development of teaching.},

  abstract = {In recent years, with the development of science and technology, the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education begin to increase. Many well-known universities in China have stepped up their pace and actively explored the deep integration of "artificial intelligence + education". A series of innovative practices, such as intelligent teaching system, intelligent classroom, virtual teaching assistant and personalized learning platform, all show that the education industry is undergoing an unprecedented intelligent transformation. But at the same time, the application of artificial intelligence in the teaching process in colleges and universities is not mature, and there are still many problems. In this context, it has become very urgent to explore how to efficiently use artificial intelligence technology to contribute to the higher education in China. This paper introduces the development process of AI and its application in colleges and universities, then analyzes the obstacles of AI when applied in higher education, and finally proposes specific application strategies for artificial intelligence to empower new teaching and learning models in universities. It is hoped that the research of this paper can improve the application of artificial intelligence in the teaching of universities in China.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the extent of student engagement with an AI-powered speaking app in a self-directed English-speaking practice setting, focusing on the relationship between usage time and second language Willingness to Communicate (L2 WTC) in and outside classrooms. Conducted at a key Chinese university, the research utilized a mixed-methods approach with surveys, usage data, and study logs from 48 sophomore students, who had approximately 10 years of English learning experience. The AI tool, TalkEzly (powered by ChatGPT 3.5), was introduced with a self-regulation framework to guide students’ independent practice. Findings revealed that only half of the students engaged actively with the AI tool, with moderate users showing a significant increase in L2 WTC. Key perceived benefits included improved speaking skills, enhanced confidence, and vocabulary expansion, though a few students reported no notable improvements. This suggests that the app's effectiveness is linked to individual engagement. While the study underscores the AI app's potential to complement classroom instruction and foster independent language learning, it also highlights the need for sustained support to promote active usage. Future research should explore strategies to support student usage, verify the relation between the increase in L2 WTC and moderate usage, and examine the long-term impacts of AI tools on L2 development. As AI technology continues to evolve, educators must adapt to optimize its integration in language learning.},

  abstract = {I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Human-Centered Computing at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, under the advisement of Dr. Foad Hamidi. My research is focused on the use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Special Education to help create more equitable learning environments for learners with disabilities. I hope to propose my dissertation studies plan by the end of August 2025. I will continue my research and plan to defend my dissertation in 2026. After I defend my dissertation, I would like to transition to a career in academia or work in a research lab. My dissertation is at the intersection of AI, Human-Computer Interaction, and inclusive education through the lens of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) [1]. Specifically, I am investigating how generative AI tools [2], such as large language models, can support special educators in designing accessible and personalized learning experiences for students with disabilities [4]. Previously, I contributed to research on DIY assistive technologies [3]. The first phase of my research included a qualitative interview study examining how K-12 special educators use and perceive AI. Findings highlighted opportunities and challenges of the use of AI. Concerns included lack of professional development, bias in AI, accessibility, and privacy issues. In the second phase, I conducted a focus group with special educators to understand how they have been using generative AI. I also conducted a participatory design session with one participant to discuss the design of an AI-enhanced tool they would like. These sessions provided an understanding of special educator experiences using AI to support neurodiverse learners. In the next phase of my research, I plan to conduct a qualitative study to understand how generative AI can assist parents and students in developing self-advocacy skills and in the creation of goals for their Individualized Education Plan (IEP) [5]. The study aims to understand experiences, perceptions, and needs of parents and students when using generative AI tools for self-advocacy.},

  abstract = {This poster reports on the differences in perceptions concerning academic dishonesty and the misuse of resources in college from the perspectives of students, teaching assistants (TAs), and instructors in Computer Science (CS). Dishonesty has been a topic of interest in the CS education community, with efforts addressing how to detect and prevent it [1, 2, 6, 7, 8]. With the presence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its increased use in recent years, studying all actors’ perspectives on dishonesty in regard to generative AI becomes critical to promote guidelines and strategies for curricular design in CS [4, 5], aligning those who teach and those who learn towards a common ethical ground. This led us to explore the following research questions with a specific emphasis on artificial intelligence in mind:(1)RQ1: How do students, instructors, and teaching assistants respond to scenarios suggesting academic dishonesty in the CS classroom?(2)RQ2: What reasons do students, instructors, and teaching assistants in CS consider may lead someone toward academic dishonesty in the CS classroom?We surveyed 538 undergraduate students, 21 TAs, and six Computer Science (CS) instructors at a large Southeastern U.S. institution. Students and TAs were part of two undergraduate CS courses. Responses were gathered via an online questionnaire that featured 13 multiple-choice questions on whether the participant thought particular situations fell most closely within “serious cheating,” “trivial cheating,” or “no cheating”–questions adapted from the work by Ozment et al. [3]; one open-ended question on the reasons the participant considered why someone might cheat in the CS classroom; and demographic questions. This poster focuses specifically on participants’ responses to the open-ended question, via a thematic analysis to identify recurring categories (i.e., themes) and assess the affinity of participants’ responses within each theme. Subgroups were participants’ demographics and backgrounds.Our findings suggest that all participants have diverse perspectives. Instructors generally referred to "Grade Pressure" and "Laziness" as the top two reasons behind dishonesty, while TAs and students emphasized "Prerequisite Knowledge" and "Time Management" as the main contributing factors. These findings suggest a dichotomy among actors involved in the learning processes happening in the CS classroom.Our work underscores the need for awareness and support strategies in curricular initiatives within the CS Ed community to help prevent dishonesty and promote student success in their computing disciplines. A clear disconnect between instructor expectations and student perceptions encourages clearer communication in the classroom and is a ripe avenue for further study.},

A lack of dataset standardisation hinders the ability to effectively benchmark and compare GenAI inpainting localisation techniques, reducing their reliability in digital forensic applications. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring the need for standardised criteria for datasets in digital forensics for benchmarking detection techniques through preliminary experiments.To address the limited diversity in existing datasets, a small-scale dataset was developed, consisting of 240 tampered images, 20 masks and 20 authentic images. This dataset includes four subject image classes (animals, objects, persons, scenery) and three inpainting tools (GLIDE, GalaxyAI, Photoshop). The dataset was evaluated against 13 localisation algorithms from the Image Forensics MATLAB Toolbox to determine key components that should be considered in the standardisation of testing environments.The results show that the images in the animals and persons categories achieved the highest F1-Scores and accuracy over the other classes. Among tools, GLIDE inpainted images were consistently shown to be the most challenging to detect, underscoring the importance of further investigating these images. These findings provide foundational insights for identifying a set of criteria to establish robust testing environments, enabling the development of reliable and accurate GenAI inpainting localisation techniques.},

However, adopting AI in smart cities is very complicated because of its multi-dimensional nature, various application fields, and also the ecosystem-like environment with many stakeholders. This study discusses seven strategic factors, including policy guarantee, stakeholder collaboration, financial capability, and public demands, information security, data availability, and AI infrastructure, and identifies their configurations which lead to a high smart city performance via the adoption of AI. A theoretical model is developed to understand smart city practice in 31 capital cities in the mainland of China. The findings reveal the complexity of AI adoption in smart cities from a configurational perspective and indicate that these factors do not work in isolation, but in combination with others to promote AI adoption in smart cities. Understanding the configurational relationships of these factors can help smart city strategists in their planning and policymaking relating to the development of smart cities.},

  abstract = {This study explores the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to supplement traditional teaching methods for first-year computer science students. The study evaluates GenAI effectiveness in teaching a new programming concept and examines its perceived utility from the students' perspective. A conversational AI platform, powered by ChatGPT, was developed as a pilot, and used as a virtual tutor, guiding students through an interactive, time-constrained learning session that involved two steps: teaching the new topic followed by problem-solving activities. After the session, students wrote a quiz without assistance to evaluate their newly acquired knowledge. A survey was then administered to collect student perceptions and analyze their interactions with the AI tutor. The preliminary findings suggest that GenAI tutors can effectively support learning, with most students preferring AI over human tutors due to convenience, accessibility, and stress-free environment. While variability of prompt effectiveness and students' misuse or overreliance on AI highlight areas were observed, these results highlight avenues for future research to refine GenAI strategies and improve student learning.},

Since such models will be integrated into future educational tools, a human-centered design approach that takes students’ perspectives into account is essential while designing such applications.This paper describes two co-design workshops which were conducted with 79 student groups to examine how they design and prototype future educational tools integrated with MLLMs. Through various activities in the workshops, students discussed relevant educational problems, created journey maps, storyboards and low fidelity prototypes for their applications, and evaluated their applications based on relevant design principles. We found that students’ applications used MLLMs for important learning environment design features such as multimodal content creation, personalization, and feedback. Based on these findings, we discuss future research directions for the design of multimodality in generative AI educational applications.},

This study explores the potential of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance disaster response within these communities. We designed a multi-modality generative AI system for disaster assessment from user-generated photos and organized reports with community in-kind cost sharing. We introduced the system prototype at the 2024 National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) conference with emergency department professionals from diverse tribal nations and other stakeholders. Through a workshop-focused group discussion, we discussed the perception, ideas, and concerns for introducing generative AI technology to tribal communities to increase disaster resilience. Our findings suggest considerations about developing strategies and possible governance models when introducing LLM-based models to marginalized local communities with limited resources. This research contributes to literature of the potential and limitations of AI in supporting disaster preparedness and response within indigenous communities, ultimately informing strategies for enhanced tribal disaster resilience and sustainable development goals.},

  abstract = {Given the increasing complexity of financial transactions and flourishing cases of accounting frauds, the traditional methods of auditing are facing significant challenges in ensuring accuracy and efficiency. This research study aimed to assess the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing the auditing process and fraud detection mechanisms by auditors from selected medium-sized accounting firms in Metro Manila. Through descriptive qualitative research method, the research study evaluated the effectiveness, challenges, and opportunities presented by the adoption of AI technologies. The findings revealed AI incorporation has helped these accounting firms in Metro Manila in complying with the Philippine Standards on Auditing (PSA) and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, it significantly enhances the precision of financial data and facilitates better-informed decision-making processes. AI is also revolutionizing the auditing landscape by automating mundane tasks, reducing stress, and expediting assessments, leading to higher job productivity, better audit quality, and more emphasis on critical thinking. The efficiency and accuracy of audit task results through AI incorporation enables auditors to identify irregular patterns and potential frauds that would be difficult to detect through conventional methods. However, the study also highlights several challenges, including concerns around bias in AI that highlight how crucial transparency and validation procedures are, in maintaining the accuracy of analysis. Despite these challenges, the overall sentiment among the firms studied is optimistic, with many recognizing the potential of AI to revolutionize financial auditing and fraud detection. The study recommended accounting firms to slowly adopt AI technologies by implementing a support initiative. This includes outlining specialized training programs that aim to bolster the AI literacy of auditors, thereby optimizing the benefits of AI in financial audit and fraud detection practices.},

We developed a multimodal music-making assistive tool informed by focus group interviews. This tool enables DHH users to create and edit music independently through language interaction with music GenAI, supported by integrated visual and tactile feedback. Our findings from the music-making study revealed that the system empowers them to engage in independent and proactive music-making activities, increasing their confidence, fostering musical expression, and positively shifting their attitudes toward music. Contributing to inclusive art by preserving the unique sensory characteristics of DHH individuals, this study demonstrates how music GenAI can benefit a marginalized community, fostering independent creative expression.},

As general users integrate GenAI into their personal and professional workflows, challenges around prompting and usability have emerged. This study examines these challenges through the lens of metacognition, specifically the metacognitive abilities of monitoring and control - self-awareness and task decomposition, during intent-based interactions with a GenAI tool, exploring how these abilities influence control over three types of tasks. Our findings reveal that self-awareness is more critical in simpler tasks, while task decomposition becomes crucial as task complexity and output novelty increase. Additionally, we investigate underlying trust in AI, finding contradictions between user’s metacognitive awareness and their faith across tasks, revealing the role of output evaluation with domain knowledge. Based on these insights, we offer recommendations for enhancing metacognitive support in GenAI tools and suggest directions for future research.},

  abstract = {From a data protection perspective, features like transparency and traceability in data sharing during public procurement and contract execution can simultaneously present weaknesses. This is particularly true for sensitive information, such as personal data, which may be disclosed during procurement processes. To address this challenge, we propose an approach that utilizes Generative Adversarial Models to generate synthetic data alongside Zero-Knowledge Proofs. This method aims to establish the authenticity of the information exchanged in the public procurement process without fully revealing it to all parties involved. By generating synthetic data as a substitute for the original while preserving the context and reliability of the public contract, our information-sharing strategy ensures that all transactions recorded on the blockchain remain private. Only the Zero-Knowledge Proofs are stored on the blockchain, keeping the original information off. Our experiments aimed to confirm that the authenticity of exchanged information in the public procurement process can be demonstrated without complete disclosure to all parties. This work represents a first step in reconciling the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)—a set of rules designed to grant EU citizens greater control over their data—with blockchain technology, which is inherently transparent and immutable.},

  abstract = {Labor market information is an important input to labor, workforce, education, and macroeconomic policy. However, granular and real-time data on labor market trends are lacking; publicly available data from survey samples are released with significant lags and miss critical information such as skills and benefits. We use generative Artificial Intelligence to automatically extract structured labor market information from unstructured online job postings for the entire U.S. labor market. To demonstrate our methodology, we construct a sample of 6,800 job postings stratified by 68 major occupational groups, extract structured information on educational requirements, remote-work flexibility, full-time availability, and benefits, and show how these job characteristics vary across occupations. As a validation, we compare frequencies of educational requirements by occupation from our sample to survey data and find no statistically significant difference. Finally, we discuss the scalability to collections of millions of job postings. Our results establish the feasibility of measuring labor market trends at scale from online job postings thanks to advances in generative AI techniques. Improved access to such insights at scale and in real-time could transform the ability of policy leaders, including federal and state agencies and education providers, to make data-informed decisions that better support the American workforce.},

  abstract = {The adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) in society and business is growing rapidly. While these systems often generate convincing and coherent responses, they risk producing incorrect or non-factual information, known as confabulations or hallucinations. Consequently, users must critically assess the reliability of these outputs when interacting with LLM-based agents. Although advancements such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have improved the technical performance of these systems, there is a lack of empirical models that explain how humans detect confabulations. Building on the explainable AI (XAI) literature, we examine the role of reasoning-based explanations in helping users identify confabulations in LLM systems. An online experiment (n = 97) reveals that analogical and factual explanations improve detection accuracy but require more time and cognitive effort than the no explanation baseline.},

  abstract = {The industrial application of artificial intelligence technology is profoundly changing the competitive pattern of enterprises. However, small and medium-sized enterprises generally face bottlenecks such as high investment threshold, lack of talents and difficult scene adaptation in the process of technology landing. This study focuses on the feasibility discrimination problem of enterprise application of artificial intelligence technology, and proposes a deep learning framework based on LSTM-Transformer hybrid model. By integrating the three types of time series characteristics of enterprise basic information, business dynamics and technology application data, a multi-dimensional evaluation system is constructed. The model adopts layered architecture: LSTM layer captures short-term business fluctuations, Transformer layer mines long-term correlation between technical input and business effectiveness, and finally realizes two-classification of "feasible" and "temporarily infeasible" through Softmax. Based on the six-year data of 2006 enterprises, the mixed model accuracy reached 89.06\% (±0.31\%) and F1 score was 87.88\% (±0.36\%), which was significantly better than the single model and CNN-LSTM baseline. Confusion matrix shows that 93.7\% of high recall guarantees the identification of potential enterprises, and 74.4\% of specificity reveals negative class discrimination optimization space. This study provides a data-driven decision-making tool for SMEs to avoid technology investment risks.},

  abstract = {Generative AI tools are used to create art-like outputs and sometimes aid in the creative process. These tools have potential benefits for artists, but they also have the potential to harm the art workforce and infringe upon artistic and intellectual property rights. Without explicit consent from artists, Generative AI creators scrape artists' digital work to train Generative AI models and produce art-like outputs at scale. These outputs are now being used to compete with human artists in the marketplace as well as being used by some artists in their generative processes to create art. We surveyed 459 artists to investigate the tension between artists' opinions on Generative AI art's potential utility and harm. This study surveys artists' opinions on the utility and threat of Generative AI art models, fair practices in the disclosure of artistic works in AI art training models, ownership and rights of AI art derivatives, and fair compensation. Results show that a majority of artists believe creators should disclose what art is being used in AI training, that AI outputs should not belong to model creators, and express concerns about AI's impact on the art workforce and who profits from their art. We hope the results of this work will further meaningful collaboration and alignment between the art community and Generative AI researchers and developers.},

To aid in this effort, we designed an open-ended generative AI project for the freshmen taking our general-education introduction to computing course. Students were required to team with generative AI to create something beyond what they alone (or the AI alone) could accomplish. Upon completion, students submitted a short written critical analysis documenting their experiences and presented a three-minute demonstration of their project in class. Despite limited course coverage of AI and generative AI prior to this project, we were impressed by the creativity and sophistication of the submitted final products as well as the breadth of generative AI tools explored. Student reflections on the experience illustrated numerous insights into the strengths and limitations of the tools they employed. Our results underscore that students can learn about the benefits and limitations of generative AI in as little as a single assignment and that covering such topics need not require extensive amounts of course time and resources.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offers numerous opportunities to revolutionise teaching and learning in Computing Education (CE). However, educators have expressed concerns that students may over-rely on GenAI and use these tools to generate solutions without engaging in the learning process. While substantial research has explored GenAI use in CE, and many Computer Science (CS) educators have expressed their opinions and suggestions on the subject, there remains little consensus on implementing curricula and assessment changes.In this paper, we describe our experiences with using GenAI in CS-focused educational settings and the changes we have implemented accordingly in our teaching in recent years since the popularisation of GenAI. From our experiences, we propose two primary actions for the CE community: 1) redesign take-home assignments to incorporate GenAI use and assess students on their process of using GenAI to solve a task rather than simply on the final product; 2) redefine the role of educators to emphasise metacognitive aspects of learning, such as critical thinking and self-evaluation. This paper presents and discusses these stances and outlines several practical methods to implement these strategies in CS classrooms. Then, we advocate for more research addressing the concrete impacts of GenAI on CE, especially those evaluating the validity and effectiveness of new teaching practices.},

To the end of computing within this crisis, we situate an in-situ experiment with LLMs in a specific, specialized form of research, namely systematic literature review. Contrary to other studies in this domain, we argue that the question of LLM integration in systematic reviews cannot be fully addressed by measuring how well LLMs replicate the labor of human researchers. It is crucial to examine the epistemological implications of how LLMs are integrated into the process. To explore this, we conducted a systematic literature review, situated within the humanities and social sciences, using two different LLM products: a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a purpose-specific tool (Elicit). We analyze how our two exemplar implementations influence the review process and what this reveals about the cognitive and epistemological effects of LLMs in research, drawing on a conceptual vocabulary of focusing on notions of bullshit and nonconscious cognition.},

  abstract = {While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various general tasks, developing domain-specific model remains an urgent need. This requires fine-tuning with high-quality data. Extraction of question-answer (QA) pairs from domain knowledge documents is a crucial prerequisite for fine-tuning, especially when these documents containing complex charts and unstructured data. This paper introduces a framework for extracting QA pairs from charts, which combines OCR and VLM to fully leverage contextual information in the documents and generate deep, contextually relevant questions. Our method first uses OCR for initial chart recognition, followed by a VLM-based “Caption-Reflection'' paradigm to reduce misrecognition. We then design a context localization module which combines local and global contexts to generate relevant QA pairs. Additionally, we construct a specialized chart knowledge base to guide the generation of QA pairs. Experimental results show significant improvement in both chart recognition performance and QA pairs generation quality: the average precision increases from 0.52 to 0.90, the average F1 Score improves from 0.64 to 0.94, the average FPR decreases from 0.55 to 0 respectively. The generated QA pairs perform well in terms of statistical relevance and contextual consistency.},

  abstract = {In this third installment of our GenAI workshop series at DIS, we focus on ‘stopsigns’—the blockages that impede progress in design research with GenAI. These stopsigns manifest as both semantic barriers (political, social, or mental frameworks) and pragmatic hurdles (technical limitations or implementation challenges) that persist despite the rapid advancements since the GenAI boom. Such stopsigns present a productive tension—they often contain partial truths worthy of consideration while simultaneously being shortsighted in ways that prevent progression. From blanket rejection to uncritical acceptance, these barriers affect how meaningfully we engage with GenAI’s potential. Our workshop welcomes both returning and first-time participants to share their experiences with these persistent challenges and work together to develop practical solutions. Through analysis of real cases and hands-on activities, we’ll build strategies for moving beyond these obstacles while acknowledging their legitimate concerns. Our goal is to foster more thoughtful integration of GenAI in design research and practice.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces Generative Artificial Experts (GAEs) - a concept of a new type of generative AI agents designed for human-AI collaboration in knowledge work. GAEs have specialized domain expertise, perform tasks within bounded autonomy, include a synthetic persona and possess multimodal generative AI capabilities, among other features. We provide a definition of GAEs which includes seven defining traits, offering a taxonomy which sets them apart from other generative AI systems. We use literature-review based conceptual analysis with abductive reasoning to propose the new concept that addresses identified limitations in existing systems. The paper explores the emergence of GAEs as a leap from expert systems. We name two enablers for GAEs - ongoing development of a research field of human-AI collaboration and growing capabilities of generative artificial intelligence systems. We discuss existing generative AI agents, noting that GAEs as such do not exist yet, but are starting to emerge. Due conceptual nature of this paper we do not explore the technical aspects of GAEs development. Instead, we use illustrative examples to present possible applications of GAEs and their potential role in the future of knowledge work. This article appears in the AI \&amp; Society track.},

  abstract = {Designing public spaces requires balancing the interests of diverse stakeholders within a constrained physical and institutional space. Designers usually approach these problems through participatory methods but struggle to incorporate diverse perspectives into design outputs. The growing capabilities of image-generative artificial intelligence (IGAI) could support participatory design. Prior work in leveraging IGAI's capabilities in design has focused on augmenting the experience and performance of individual creators. We study how IGAI could facilitate participatory processes when designing public spaces, a complex collaborative task. We conducted workshops and IGAI-mediated interviews in a real-world participatory process to upgrade a park in Los Angeles. We found (1) a shift from focusing on accuracy to fostering richer conversations as the desirable outcome of adopting IGAI in participatory design, (2) that IGAI promoted more space-aware conversations, and (3) that IGAI-mediated conversations are subject to the abilities of the facilitators in managing the interaction between themselves, the AI, and stakeholders. We contribute by discussing practical implications for using IGAI in participatory design, including success metrics, relevant skills, and asymmetries between designers and stakeholders. We finish by proposing a series of open research questions.},

  abstract = {Eye-tracking technology is increasingly integrated into smart glasses and wearable devices, becoming more prevalent in daily life. Meanwhile, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the potential to transform user experiences through personalization and adaptive interactions. The integration of these technologies offers a novel opportunity to refine GenAI models by leveraging human gaze data in adaptive interfaces, personalized content generation, and human-computer interaction. However, gaze data is highly sensitive and can reveal several user attributes, such as cognitive states, emotions, and even medical conditions. Therefore, the use of gaze data to inform GenAI models raises significant privacy concerns. Hence, in this paper, we highlight the implications of using eye gaze information in GenAI models with privacy and societal considerations and discuss strategies to mitigate potential privacy violations. By addressing these issues, we can ensure a trade-off between technological advancements and privacy protection.},

  abstract = {Information Retrieval (IR) systems are crucial tools for users to access information, which have long been dominated by traditional methods relying on similarity matching. With the advancement of pre-trained language models, Generative Information Retrieval (GenIR) emerges as a novel paradigm, attracting increasing attention. Based on the form of information provided to users, current research in GenIR can be categorized into two aspects: (1) Generative Retrieval (GR) leverages the generative model’s parameters for memorizing documents, enabling retrieval by directly generating relevant document identifiers without explicit indexing. (2) Reliable Response Generation employs language models to directly generate information users seek, breaking the limitations of traditional IR in terms of document granularity and relevance matching while offering flexibility, efficiency, and creativity to meet practical needs. This article aims to systematically review the latest research progress in GenIR. We will summarize the advancements in GR regarding model training and structure, document identifier, incremental learning, and so on, as well as progress in reliable response generation in aspects of internal knowledge memorization, external knowledge augmentation, and so on. We also review the evaluation, challenges, and future developments in GenIR systems. This review aims to offer a comprehensive reference for researchers, encouraging further development in the GenIR field (Github Repository: ).},

  abstract = {For decades, scholars have emphasized that tasks should be the central focus in Information Retrieval (IR). This point of view holds even more significance with the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, which can, among other capabilities, understand natural language, engage in dialog with users, generate bespoke user interfaces, and power agents to help complete tasks. GenAI presents an unprecedented opportunity to finally realize the potential of tasks in IR, enhance task-focused retrieval and interaction, and create ''magical'' task completion moments for users. In this paper, we explore the rationale and methodology behind this argument. Traditional IR systems support mostly simple tasks. The emergence of GenAI creates an opportunity for IR systems to help users achieve complex tasks and for the IR community to rekindle its interest and demonstrate leadership in this sizable and significant problem space. We underscore the pivotal role of tasks in IR and introduce new evidence supporting the notion that task-centric approaches, abstracted from specific modalities, represent the future of IR. Building on this foundation, we envision the development, utilization, and evaluation of next-generation IR systems. We propose a promising future where IR agents prioritize users, their tasks, and their situations. However, despite their potential to address task-focused and modality-independent IR, agents alone are insufficient. We propose a robust ecosystem around these agents that transcends traditional queries, questions, prompts, and modalities to address users' fundamental needs, tasks, and goals.},

Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence&nbsp;(GAI) and extended reality&nbsp;(XR) provided new solutions for rapid prototype transition and mixed simulation. We conducted a formative study to understand current challenges in the traditional prototype process and explore how to effectively utilize GAI and XR ability in prototype. Then we introduced FusionProtor, a mixed-prototype tool for component-level 3D prototype transition and simulation. We proposed a step-by-step generation pipeline in FusionProtor, effectively transiting 3D prototypes from physical to virtual and low- to high-fidelity for rapid ideation and iteration. We also innovated a component-level 3D creation method and applied it in XR environment for the mixed-prototype presentation and interaction. We conducted technical and user experiments to verify FusionProtor’s usability in supporting diverse designs. Our results verified that it achieved a seamless workflow between physical and virtual domains, enhancing efficiency and promoting ideation. We also explored the effect of mixed interaction on design and critically discussed its best practices for HCI community.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence has a powerful database and language generation function, which can be used as an extension of the human brain to a certain extent. Its application in the field of education has brought about a double-sided effect. On the one hand, AI promotes the great enrichment of material and spiritual wealth and makes it possible to liberate people's hands, which are the basis and conditions for human's freedom and all-round development. On the other hand, AI also brings some hidden worries to education: reshaping people's values, exacerbating the gap in educational resources, and triggering ethical controversies. Based on the Marxist theory on the freedom and comprehensive development of human beings, this paper focuses on the hidden worries of future education under the influence of artificial intelligence to explore the reform paths of future education. The reform paths including establishing correct value concepts to correctly understand the value of education; focusing on independent and diversified learning to cultivate students’ ability of independent critical thinking; breaking down technological barriers to build a technology development platform and share AI technology; sounding ethical rules as well as strengthening institutional regulations and technological protection support to shape the concept of science and technology for good and enhance people's awareness of digital security and self-protection. Promoting future education's reformation in the age of artificial intelligence with correct values, fair educational resources and sound ethical rules can play a good role in educating and cultivating autonomous, diversified and comprehensive new-age talents.},

  abstract = {3D generative models of faces trained on in-the-wild image collections have improved greatly in recent times, offering better visual fidelity and view consistency. Making such generative models animatable is a hard yet rewarding task, with applications in virtual AI agents, character animation, and telepresence. However, it is not trivial to learn a well-behaved animation model with the generative setting, as the learned latent space aims to best capture the data distribution, often omitting details such as dynamic appearance and entangling animation with other factors that affect controllability. We present GAIA: Generative Animatable Interactive Avatars, which is able to generate high-fidelity 3D head avatars for both realistic animation and rendering. To achieve consistency during animation, we learn to generate Gaussians embedded in an underlying morphable model for human heads via a shared UV parameterization. For modeling realistic animation, we further design the generator to learn expression-conditioned details for both geometric deformation and dynamic appearance. Finally, facing an inevitable entanglement problem between facial identity and expression, we propose a novel two-branch architecture that encourages the generator to disentangle identity and expression. On existing benchmarks, GAIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual quality as well as realistic animation. The generated Gaussian-based avatar supports highly efficient animation and rendering, making it readily available for interactive animation and appearance editing.},

Across three use cases: generative scenography, physical space extension, and improvised narration—AI tools were integrated into live performance contexts to dynamically respond to human presence and input. Techniques included the use of real-time generative visuals, silhouette-based transformations, and voice-activated storytelling systems.The findings highlight both the creative opportunities and technical constraints of employing GenAI in live performance. Critical insights emerged around timing, audience perception, system orchestration, and the need for adaptable, artist-centric AI workflows.

Without a solid understanding of generative AI, it can be difficult for individuals to fully embrace this emerging technology. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the concepts, technologies, and real-world impact of generative AI.The course begins with a historical overview of artificial intelligence that traces its evolution from early rules-based logic to the deep learning breakthroughs that have enabled today's most powerful generative AI models. Participants will explore foundational concepts that include illustrations of neural network models to gain intuition behind how machines learn to generate text, images, and other types of content. The course delves into practical applications of generative AI across multiple modalities, including natural language, computer vision, audio, and more. Participants will also study high-level system architectures of an AI chatbot, the poster child of generative AI, to understand how these systems operate. Finally, the course will examine future development of generative AI, including the rise of agentic applications that can reason, plan, and interact autonomously.},

  abstract = {The rapid progression of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has raised significant interest and concern in academia. Instances of students submitting AI-generated assignments prompt investigations into implications for teaching, learning, and academic integrity. Recent publications highlight concerns such as a lack of conceptual understanding, threats to academic integrity, and disruptions to traditional assessment methods. While recognizing benefits like automated scoring and personalized learning, authors stress the responsible use of GenAI, emphasizing the educator's role in guiding students. This commentary identifies opportunities and threats of GenAI in African university contexts. Opportunities include increased operational efficiency, content generation, automated assessment, recognition of accessibility needs, overcoming language barriers, and accelerated research. However, these tools require human correction and cautious consideration of job displacement concerns. Threats encompass job displacement, privacy and security issues, threats to academic integrity, hallucinations/confabulations of GenAI, access and infrastructure challenges, technological overemphasis, lack of customization for local needs and cultural contexts, dependency on external providers, and unaffordable costs. The need for robust guidelines that balance technological advances with traditional teaching methods in African universities is emphasized. Given digital transformation initiatives like the African Union's Agenda 2063 and Botswana's SmartBots strategy, integrating GenAI could shape the future of African tertiary education. Proactive policies should address ethical concerns, ensure access, and make GenAI tools available, requiring a collaborative effort to navigate its impact responsibly.},

  abstract = {Despite recent advances in understanding the capabilities and limits of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, we are just beginning to understand their capacity to assess and reason about the veracity of content. We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and “hard” criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.},

  abstract = {Creative learning has significantly enriched on-site museum education by fostering deeper engagement, encouraging exploration, and promoting active participation through hands-on experiences. However, the digital transformation of holistic and structured creative learning processes in museum education remains largely underexplored. Although Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) holds promise for supporting creative learning, its full integration across all phases in non-formal education settings like museums remains limited. In this work, we designed Mariscope, a GenAI-supported creative learning platform for marine museum education. By integrating GenAI with the five stages of the iterative creative learning path, Mariscope offers a personalized and dynamic learning experience. A preliminary study with four participants demonstrated positive impacts on learning outcomes and creative self-efficacy, showcasing the platform’s potential for enhancing digital museum education through iterative and interactive creative learning processes.},

  abstract = {This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI), and - among other approaches - particularly to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together.Following successful workshops in 2022–2024, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

  abstract = {Existing approaches for color-concept association typically rely on query-based image referencing, and color extraction from image references. However, these approaches are effective only for common concepts, and are vulnerable to unstable image referencing and varying image conditions. Our formative study with designers underscores the need for primary-accent color compositions and context-dependent colors (e.g., ‘clear’ vs.‘polluted’ sky) in design. In response, we introduce a generative approach for mining semantically resonant colors leveraging images generated by text-to-image models. Our insight is that contemporary text-to-image models can resemble visual patterns from large-scale real-world data. The framework comprises three stages: concept instancing produces generative samples using diffusion models, text-guided image segmentation identifies concept-relevant regions within the image, and color association extracts primary accompanied by accent colors. Quantitative comparisons with expert designs validate our approach’s effectiveness, and we demonstrate the applicability through cases in various design scenarios and a gallery.},

The development of international Chinese education also requires the digitalization and intelligence of international Chinese teaching resources. In this regard, this article utilizes the technology of ChatGPT platform to integrate teaching resources, constructs an artificial intelligence teaching resource generation framework consisting of demand analysis, intelligent generation, and quality assessment modules, as well as a quality evolution model of artificial intelligence international Chinese teaching resources. Based on this framework and resource quality evolution model, an experiment on the generation of artificial intelligence teaching resources was carried out, and inspections and evaluations were conducted from the perspectives of natural language processing technology, learners, and teachers. The results show that the teaching resources generated by artificial intelligence pass the inspection of natural language understanding technology and have good quality; learners and teachers are optimistic about the application of teaching resources in teaching and believe that most of these resources have reached a usable state; learners' overall experience in using teaching resources is positive and they believe that these resources can promote learning in many aspects. The application of artificial intelligence in generating teaching resources in this article helps to optimize the construction mode of international Chinese teaching resources and promote the high-quality development of international Chinese education.},

Although generative AI agents provide unparalleled capabilities, they also have unique safety concerns. These challenges require robust safeguards, especially for autonomous machines that operate in high-stakes environments. This work investigates the evolving safety requirements when generative models are integrated as agents into physical autonomous machines, comparing these to safety considerations in less critical AI applications. We explore the challenges and opportunities to ensure the safe deployment of generative AI-driven autonomous machines. Furthermore, we provide a forward-looking perspective on the future of AI-driven autonomous systems and emphasize the importance of evaluating and communicating safety risks. As an important step towards addressing these concerns, we recommend the development and implementation of comprehensive safety scorecards for the use of generative AI technologies in autonomous machines.},

To explore the future potentials and risks of this understudied area, we created six design fictions depicting scenarios such as virtual companions delivering news summaries to the user, AI providing context to news topics, and content being transformed into other formats on demand. The fictions, discussed with a multi-disciplinary group of experts, enabled a critical examination of the diverse ethical, societal, and journalistic implications of AI shaping this everyday activity. The discussions raised several concerns, suggesting that such consumer-oriented AI applications can clash with journalistic values and processes. These include fears that neither consumers nor AI could successfully balance engagement, objectivity, and truth, leading to growing detachment from shared understanding. We offer critical insights into the potential long-term effects to guide design efforts in this emerging application area of GenAI.},

In this work, we introduce and evaluate perceptual harms, a term for the harms caused to users when others perceive or suspect them of using AI. We examined perceptual harms in three online experiments, each of which entailed participants evaluating write-ups from mock freelance writers. We asked participants to state whether they suspected the freelancers of using AI, to rank the quality of their writing, and to evaluate whether they should be hired. We found some support for perceptual harms against certain demographic groups. At the same time, perceptions of AI use negatively impacted writing evaluations and hiring outcomes across the board.},

  abstract = {Software development activities must adhere to industry, national, and/or international regulatory standards to ensure security, safety, and other important properties in high-stakes, regulated domains, such as healthcare, automotive, and aerospace. These software standards are often codified via multiple documents, ranging from specific requirements to general guidance. Software developers must demonstrate—and regulatory authorities must then verify—the completeness and consistency between the software artifacts and the software regulatory documents. Detecting regulatory document incompleteness, inconsistencies, and/or discrepancies (DIID) with respect to software artifacts is important for both developers and regulators because they indicate potential non-conformance and/or software regulatory risk.DIID detection is currently a human-intensive activity where people learn the standards and then review or search software artifacts to find or detect potential issues. This tedious and error-prone manual process is even more challenging with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that create frequent software updates. In addition, software artifacts (such as requirements or architecture documents) and software standards also change as the software is maintained, requiring ongoing manual reviews and revisions.Generative AI can accelerate DIID detection for different documents and data sources. This paper explores how generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), can accelerate DIID detection in software artifacts, particularly when comparing trusted documents like safety standards with software development artifacts. Integrating LLMs into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to detect DIID can improve specific development activities, as well as enable transformative opportunities by accelerating end-to-end SDLC workflows and regulatory compliance. Current LLM benchmarks and testing frameworks do not sufficiently test for detecting DIID and require extension to adequately and consistently detect DIID across multiple SDLC activities. This position paper describes how LLMs can accelerate software assurance processes and ensure greater compliance with industry standards and government regulatory requirements.},

Network Digital Twins, which simulate networks in the digital domain for evaluation, offer a solution to these challenges. This concept is further enhanced by generative AI technology, which promises more efficient and accurate AI-driven data generation for network simulation and optimization. This survey provides insights into generative AI-empowered network digital twins. We begin by outlining the architecture of a network digital twin, which encompasses both digital and physical domains. This architecture involves four key steps: data processing and network monitoring, digital replication and network simulation, designing and training network optimizers, Sim2Real, and network control. Next, we systematically discuss the related studies in each step and make a detailed taxonomy of the problem studied, the methods used, and the key designs leveraged. Each step is examined with a focus on the role of generative AI, from estimating missing data and simulating network behaviors to designing control strategies and bridging the gap between digital and physical domains. Finally, we discuss the open issues and challenges of generative AI-based network digital twins.},

With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) technologies in areas like image generation and natural language processing, generative AI has also played a crucial role in addressing key issues in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), such as data sparsity, difficulty in observing abnormal scenarios, and in modeling data uncertainty. In this review, we systematically investigate the relevant literature on generative AI techniques in addressing key issues in different types of tasks in ITS tailored specifically for road transportation. First, we introduce the principles of different generative AI techniques. Then, we classify tasks in ITS into four types: traffic perception, traffic prediction, traffic simulation, and traffic decision-making. We systematically illustrate how generative AI techniques addresses key issues in these four different types of tasks. Finally, we summarize the challenges faced in applying generative AI to ITS, and discuss future research directions based on different application scenarios.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated significant potential in clinical reasoning skills such as history-taking and differential diagnosis generation—critical aspects of medical education. This work explores how LLMs can augment medical curricula through interactive learning. We conducted a participatory design process with medical students, residents and medical education experts to co-create an AI-powered tutor prototype for clinical reasoning. As part of the co-design process, we conducted a qualitative user study, investigating learning needs and practices via interviews, and conducting concept evaluations through interactions with the prototype. Findings highlight the challenges learners face in transitioning from theoretical knowledge to practical application, and how an AI tutor can provide personalized practice and feedback. We conclude with design considerations, emphasizing the importance of context-specific knowledge and emulating positive preceptor traits, to guide the development of AI tools for medical education.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to simulate rare disease situations. This is a potential way to train robotic systems, especially for medical actions. It can be hard to get real-world data for training because trends in rare diseases are often complicated, varied, and hard to predict. This can make it time-consuming, expensive, and morally problematic. Generative AI models, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variation Autoencoders (VAEs), can make fake but real medical situations that show how complicated rare diseases are. It is easy to make different datasets with these AI-driven models. These datasets can then be used to train robots so they can do complicated medical treatments more accurately and quickly By adding these AI models to artificial training environments, it is possible to create many rare disease cases that would be hard to make in regular training settings. The models improve robots' abilities to make smart choices, deal with new problems, and guess how patients will do in real time by exposing them to a lot of different situations. Using generative AI also cuts down on the need for real patient data, which protects privacy while still providing the reality needed for effective training. This method not only makes medical robots better at their jobs and more flexible in situations involving rare diseases, but it also makes it easier for them to keep learning. The robots can get better at making decisions by going through virtual situations that get more complicated. In the end, this study looks at how generative AI could be used to make computer systems that are smarter and can react to rare diseases. This would make medical treatments in these specialized fields more accurate and safer.},

This paper investigates how generative AI can be integrated into documentary practice while maintaining ethical standards. Through interviews with six documentary photographers, we explored their views on AI’s potential to support community-driven storytelling. While AI presents opportunities for creative expression and community involvement, concerns about trust, authenticity, and decontextualization of images persist. Photographers expressed doubts about AI’s ability to accurately represent lived experiences, fearing it could compromise narrative integrity. Our findings suggest that AI tools should be designed to enhance collaboration and transparency in storytelling, complementing rather than replacing traditional documentary methods. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI in photography, advocating for the development of tools that preserve the ethical foundations of documentary storytelling while empowering communities.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, content generation has sparked a transformative revolution in the field of education. In traditional education, teachers often spend a lot of time preparing lessons, because students have varying levels of proficiency, teachers need to consider whether the teaching content is suitable for everyone. Generative AI provides an effective solution to this problem by automatically generating personalized, high-quality educational content, which not only alleviates the burden on teachers but also enhances students' learning outcomes. This study focuses on a novel deep generative model—a framework based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and the self-attention mechanism (Transformer). We propose a model called the Hyperspherical Variational Self-Attention Autoencoder (HVSAE), which aims to generate personalized learning content based on students' learning situations, thereby reducing the burden on teachers and improving learning outcomes. The experimental results indicate that the model can generate high-quality educational resources, providing important support for achieving more personalized and efficient education.},

This study employs a mixed-methods approach using surveys and interviews to explore the current and potential roles of GenAI in rural high school classrooms across three U.S. regions. Preliminary findings reveal mixed perceptions: rural teachers value GenAI's ability to personalize learning but worry about encountering misinformation and feel unprepared to mitigate these risks due to their current level of AI literacy. While GenAI offers potential to enhance students' tech skills and reduce resource disparities, barriers like unreliable internet access and a lack of students owning personal devices still hinder its effectiveness, leaving both teachers and students under-supported in fully leveraging the technology. Overall, this study aims to explore rural teachers' experiences with GenAI to help develop strategies for fair and effective integration that address their unique challenges.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) holds significant potential for transforming education, yet its adoption in special education remains underexplored. It is important to investigate how special education teachers perceive and use GAI for two distinct instructional tasks: instructional enrichment and accommodations. Although the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been extensively used to study technology adoption, its application to GAI in special education is underrepresented. This gap is critical as special education teachers must address diverse needs of students with multiple disabilities. Moreover, limited research had examined how TAM dimensions vary across different tasks. This late-breaking study revealed that teachers consistently rated GAI lower for accommodations across all TAM dimensions, with particularly differences in Intention to Use and Actual Use. The results highlighted the complexities of adopting GAI for distinct instructional purposes. Although GAI demonstrated potential for supporting instructional enrichment, its inability to generate individualized recommendations limited its effectiveness for accommodations.},

But to what extent is the technology already in use? Our survey of UK public service professionals (in education, health, social work, and emergency services) seeks to answer this question. We find that use of generative AI is widespread: 45\% of respondents were aware of colleagues using generative AI, while 22\% use it themselves. Respondents were positive about its potential to enhance their efficiency and reduce their bureaucratic workload. For example, those working in the health service thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop by the equivalent of one day per week, an enormous potential impact. Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61\%) in generative AI and a low fear of replacement (16\%). However, only a minority of respondents (32\%) felt like there was clear guidance on generative AI usage in their workplaces. In other words, it is clear that generative AI is already coming into the public sector, but uptake is happening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines. The UK’s public sector urgently needs to develop more systematic methods for taking advantage of the technology.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is positively grasped as promising to disrupt the higher education system but it also poses a number of challenges. Although so many studies attempt to explore the matching of the possibility of this growing technology with the higher education system, ample research needs to be conducted to solve the challenges facing the renovation of higher education. With this in mind, our aim of bibliometric studies is to conduct a deep investigation into the increasingly developing scenario of Generative AI tools in higher education. We extracted data from the Web of Science database that is up-to-date till July 2024, comprising 934 relevant articles. Co-citation and co-word analyses revealed three main research clusters: advanced computationable methods, AI application in higher education, and user technology and adoption. The findings illustrated rapid diffusion of generative AI technologies with prominent emphasis on large-language models in pedagogical practices. Other critical themes center around developing AI-facilitated learning interventions, ethical challenges, and usage impact on learning outcomes. The results show that the field is inherently interdisciplinary, using ideas from educational technology, cognitive science, and AI. In addition, a rising trend is noted for the focus on academic honesty and users' involvement with AI devices. The results indicate the important implications of this study for teachers and policymakers alongside contributions to teaching and research that offer a guide to sustainable improvement across education. Future research would benefit from longitudinal studies drawing on an interdisciplinary approach to realize the long-term implications and address complex issues surrounding the integration of AI within universities.},

As GenAI integration in higher education grows, understanding its influence on critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity is essential. Using a mixed-effects model, we synthesized data from quantitative studies to explore two moderators: cognitive skill level (e.g., understanding, applying, analyzing) and instructional context (instructed vs. unguided use). Our findings indicate that GenAI tools significantly enhance lower-order cognitive outcomes, particularly in understanding and applying concepts, with instructed use producing stronger positive effects than unguided use. However, their impact on higher-order cognitive skills, such as creating and evaluating, was minimal. These results highlight the importance of tailoring GenAI integration to task complexity and underscore the value of guided instruction in maximizing its educational benefits. Educators should prioritize instructional strategies that encourage active engagement with GenAI tools, particularly for fostering critical thinking and creativity.},

The prompts for each character were constructed from the linguistic features of classical texts, and each generated sentence was encoded into semantic, lexical, and keyword-based features. K-means clustering was used to identify stylistic categories, and the number of clusters was validated using the Elbow Method and the Silhouette Coefficient. Evaluation used BLEU, Perplexity, and a custom Style Consistency Score. As a result, the K-means-enhanced model improved fluency and style consistency over the baseline. This method provides a quantitative approach to improving generative models in traditional cultural domains.},

  abstract = {As artificial intelligence becomes an everyday presence across education, arts and creative technologies, and cultural heritage, the interaction between users and intelligent systems deserves critical examination. This submission presents a systematic review of 95 case studies, 64 in education, 14 in arts, and 17 in heritage — selected via a PRISMA-guided search and expert screening — to map how generative artificial intelligence is embedded at both the interface and interaction levels. We identify nine interface archetypes (e.g., conversational, adaptive dashboards, immersive environments interfaces), eight interaction patterns (e.g., conversing, collaborating, manipulating),and eight main user experience dimensions as observed in case studies. Our analysis further categorizes six modality-usage patterns—from text, image, audio, and video up to fully multi-modal workflows and distillsfour main categories of end-to-end application pipelines. Notably, only two studies were found to articulate design-phase guidelines, and limitations cluster around output quality, ethical risks, and a lack of longitudinal evaluations. We conclude with limitations observed and future research focused on explainability, participatory design, and sustained field deployments. This synthesis provides a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness generative artificial intelligence as a responsive, human-centered collaborator.},

  abstract = {As the platform economy enters the deep-water zone of intelligent transformation, generative artificial intelligence (AIGC) technology is reshaping the core logic of content production and marketing strategy. In this paper, we construct the ‘AIGC-DRIVE’ dynamic closed-loop model to explain the role of AIGC in the innovation of platform economy content production and marketing strategy, and carry out efficiency comparison, AB test of AIGC advertisement strategy, and research on users' privacy concerns, as well as combining with the typical case studies of Jitterbug and SHEIN. It is found that AIGC can greatly improve the production efficiency and support the real-time optimisation of dynamic marketing strategies through data-driven multimodal content generation; however, the application of the technology faces the risks of content homogenisation, algorithmic black-boxing and user privacy leakage. This paper proposes a synergistic mechanism of ‘technology embedding - institutional constraints - user feedback’ to achieve sustainable development, which provides a theoretical basis and a practical path for the design of the governance framework of AIGC in the platform economy.},

The paper first analyzes the development of AIGC technology and its great potential in the field of education, especially the role of LLM in content generation. It then discusses the concept, risks, and construction strategies of vocational education digital textbooks, emphasizing the importance of digital textbooks in teaching and their differences compared with paper textbooks. The study also designs a knowledge retrieval question-answering system based on RAG, which combines school-based textbooks and cooperative enterprise manuals as a knowledge base to generate responses to student questions. While ensuring accuracy and completeness, the quality of the responses was improved by the merge of students' queries with relevant texts using RAG technology. Regarding implementation, RAG technology consists of knowledge base construction and knowledge retrieval. It includes segmenting the document, recognizing and vectorizing it in order to build a vector database. During user retrieval, queries are sorted through the vector database interface, and the matched knowledge fragments and query statements are merged to generate answers including specific domain knowledge. This framework of the RAG question-answering system can provide accurate answers to satisfy students of all levels in personalized teaching while maintaining explainability and timeliness of the content.},

  abstract = {We present a tool for enhancing the detail of physically based materials using an off-the-shelf diffusion model and inverse rendering. Our goal is to increase the visual fidelity of existing materials by adding, for instance, signs of wear, aging, and weathering that are tedious to author. To obtain realistic appearance with minimal user effort, we leverage a generative image model trained on a large dataset of natural images. Given the geometry, UV mapping, and basic appearance of an object, we proceed as follows: We render multiple views of the object and use them, together with an appearance-defining text prompt, to condition a diffusion model. The generated details are then backpropagated from the enhanced images to the material parameters via inverse rendering. For inverse rendering to be successful, the generated appearance has to be consistent across all the images. We propose two priors to address the multi-view consistency of the diffusion model. First, we ensure that the noise that seeds the diffusion process is itself consistent across views by integrating it from a view-independent UV space. Second, we enforce spatial consistency by biasing the attention mechanism via a projective constraint so that pixels attend strongly to their corresponding pixel locations in other views. Our approach does not require any training or finetuning of the diffusion model, is agnostic to the used material model, and the enhanced material properties, i.e., 2D PBR textures, can be further edited by artists. We demonstrate prompt-based material edits exhibiting high levels of realism and detail. This project is available at https://generative-detail.github.io.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary computation (EC) is a kind of artificial intelligence (AI) for optimization. However, traditional EC algorithms require the careful design of parameters and/or operators from experts. Designing an operator with generalization ability is a tough task, and the manually design process is often limited by the structures of existing operators, which lacks diversity. In order to explore operators with diverse structures and good generalization ability so as to provide inspiration for the manually design of operators, this paper proposes a generative EC approach for the automatic design of operators by using genetic programming (GP). We apply the generative approach to a typical EC variant named gene targeting differential evolution (GTDE), so as to propose a new automatic GTDE (AGTDE) algorithm. The AGTDE utilizes the advantage of GP in optimizing structural features to automatically generate and refine the targeting vector generation operator within GTDE. This way, the operator of AGTDE is generated automatically rather than manually designed, which is more robust and optimal. The experimental results demonstrate that AGTDE is capable of identifying appropriate and even better operator for solving optimization problems, when compared with GTDE with manually design operator. Moreover, the results show that the operator obtained for one problem can be applied to other problems and obtain promising results, which reflect the robustness and generalization ability of the operator generated by GP. Therefore, this generative approach may provide some novel avenues of thought for the automatically design of EC algorithm operators.},

  abstract = {Historically, information retrieval systems have all followed the same paradigm: information seekers frame their needs in the form of a short query, the system selects a small set of relevant results from a corpus of available documents, rank-orders the results by decreasing relevance, possibly excerpts a responsive passage for each result, and returns a list of references and excerpts to the user. Retrieval systems typically did not attempt fusing information from multiple documents into an answer and displaying that answer directly. This was largely due to available technology: at the core of each retrieval system is an index that maps lexical tokens or semantic embeddings to document identifiers. Indices are designed for retrieving responsive documents; they do not support integrating these documents into a holistic answer. More recently, the coming-of-age of deep neural networks has dramatically improved the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Trained on a large corpus of documents, these models not only memorize the vocabulary, morphology and syntax of human languages, but have shown to be able to memorize facts and relations [3]. Generative language models, when provided with a prompt, will extend the prompt with likely completions - an ability that can be used to extract answers to questions from the model. Four years ago, Metzler et al. argued that this ability of LLMs will allow us to rethink the search paradigm: to answer information needs directly rather that directing users to responsive primary sources [1]. Their vision was not without controversy; the following year Shaw and Bender argued that such a system is neither feasible nor desirable [4]. Nonetheless, the past four years have seen the emergence of such systems, with offerings from established search engines and many new entrants to the industry. This keynote (an updated version of [2]) will summarize the history of these generative information retrieval systems, and focus on the many open challenges: ensuring that answers are grounded, attributing answer passages to a primary source, providing nuanced answers to non-factoid-seeking questions, avoiding bias, and going beyond simple regurgitation of memorized facts. It will also touch on the changing nature of the content ecosystem. LLMs are starting to be used to generate web content. Should search engines treat such derived content equal to human-authored content? Is it possible to distinguish generated from original content? And how should we view hybrid authorship where humans contribute ideas and LLMs shape these ideas into prose?},

  abstract = {As we usher in the Industry 4.0 age, artificial intelligence (AI) is seeing increasing impact on education. Educational practitioners often follow the first principles of instruction (FPIs), such as problem-centered teaching, activation, demonstration, application, and integration, when designing intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL) environments.  Against this backdrop, generative inquiry learning (GIL), a new model of education, offers new solutions to the challenges that education faces currently as AI penetrates every aspect of our lives and incurs “technological alienation” in the domain of education. Thus, in the present work, a teacher-student-machine collaborative framework based on the 4C/ID model is put forth, and the adoption of AI in instructional design and student inquiry is discussed. Moreover, a case study on the module “Python Programming” was performed to investigate how the reconstruction of traditional teaching processes could improve the student's critical thinking, creativity, and self-motivation in learning. It was found that GIL could reduce the students’ cognitive load and improve the teachers’ teaching efficiency, providing strong support for educational reform to cultivate talent better suited to the needs of the development of Industry 4.0.},

  abstract = {Zero-shot Relation Triplet Extraction (ZeroRTE) aims to extract relation triplets from texts containing unseen relation types. This capability benefits various downstream information retrieval (IR) tasks. The primary challenge lies in enabling models to generalize effectively to unseen relation categories. Existing approaches typically leverage the knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models to accomplish the generalization process. However, these methods focus solely on fitting the training data during training, without specifically improving the model's generalization performance, resulting in limited generalization capability. For this reason, we explore the integration of bi-level optimization (BLO) with pre-trained language models for learning generalized knowledge directly from the training data, and propose a generative meta-learning framework which exploits the 'learning-to-learn' ability of meta-learning to boost the generalization capability of generative models.Specifically, we introduce a BLO approach that simultaneously addresses data fitting and generalization. This is achieved by constructing an upper-level loss to focus on generalization and a lower-level loss to ensure accurate data fitting. Building on this, we subsequently develop three generative meta-learning methods, each tailored to a distinct category of meta-learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework performs well on the ZeroRTE task. Our code is available at https://github.com/leeworry/TGM-MetaLearning.},

  abstract = {Generative recommender systems have gained increasing attention as an innovative approach that directly generates item identifiers for recommendation tasks. Despite their potential, a major challenge is the effective construction of item identifiers that align well with recommender systems. Current approaches often treat item tokenization and generative recommendation training as separate processes, which can lead to suboptimal performance. To overcome this issue, we introduce ETEGRec, a novel End-To-End Generative Recommender that unifies item tokenization and generative recommendation into a cohesive framework. Built on a dual encoder-decoder architecture, ETEGRec consists of an item tokenizer and a generative recommender. To enable synergistic interaction between these components, we propose a recommendation-oriented alignment strategy, which includes two key optimization objectives: sequence-item alignment and preference-semantic alignment. These objectives tightly couple the learning processes of the item tokenizer and the generative recommender, fostering mutual enhancement. Additionally, we develop an alternating optimization technique to ensure stable and efficient end-to-end training of the entire framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to traditional sequential recommendation models and existing generative recommendation baselines.

  abstract = {Data-free generative modeling (GM) methods have gained much attention because pseudo data avoids security and privacy issues, and no amount limitation for storing real data in Class-Incremental Learning (CIL). However, GM-based methods have three drawbacks: un stable quality of generated image, semantic sifting, and domain bias for knowledge and distillation. To tackle with these problems, we propose an effective two-stage training method based on generative replay distillation, namely GA-RCT in this paper. It mainly consists of three modules. The Generative Adaptive Replay (GAR) module in stage one obtainsa well-trained generator for every task, then freezes generator for generating stable images, and trains feature extractor with mixture of real data and generated data. The Global Average Class (GAC) module is designed to reserve class prototypes to reduce semantic drift in the training stage. And the Generative Auxiliary Teaching (GAT) module in stage two performs generative distillation in dual-teacher to student way, for solving domain bias. Experiments on four datasets have shown that GA-RCT performs better than other generative replay methods.},

This includes: insights on the creation process, a set of prototype explorations, and an integrated workflow for multi-modal video generation. Generative video is rapidly evolving and delivering higher quality outputs. While video generation models have potential for film-making and content creation, they lack controllability for creative expression: viable videos can require hundreds of unsuccessful attempts. To understand this emergent practice, and due to the constant evolution of models and limited number of early adopters, I explored Generative Rotoscoping over 12 months and created AI workflows leading to over 40,000 video/image files examining a variety of models and techniques including: structural guidance, frame consistency, image referencing and masks, compositing, among others. Insights from this work can serve as a starting point for designing the next generation of video authoring tools.},

However, reading proficiency among K-12 students has been declining globally, including in Sweden, leaving many underprepared for post-secondary education. Additionally, an increasing number of students have reading disorders, such as dyslexia, which require support. Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) technologies, like ChatGPT, may offer new opportunities to improve reading practices by enhancing the readability of educational texts. This study investigates whether ChatGPT-4 can simplify academic texts and which prompting strategies are most effective. We tasked ChatGPT to re-write 136 academic texts using four prompting approaches: Standard, Meta, Roleplay, and Chain-of-Thought. All four approaches improved text readability, with Meta performing the best overall and the Standard prompt sometimes creating texts that were less readable than the original. This study found variability in the simplified texts, suggesting that different strategies should be used based on the specific needs of individual learners. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of genAI tools, like ChatGPT, to improve the accessibility of academic texts, offering valuable support for students with reading difficulties and promoting more equitable learning opportunities.},

  abstract = {Generative models have recently demonstrated strong potential in multi-behavior recommendation systems, leveraging the expressive power of transformers and tokenization to generate personalized item sequences. However, their adoption is hindered by (1) the lack of explicit information for token reasoning, (2) high computational costs due to quadratic attention complexity and dense sequence representations after tokenization, and (3) limited multi-scale modeling over user history. In this work, we propose GRACE (Generative Recommendation via journey-aware sparse Attention on Chain-of-thought tokEnization), a novel generative framework for multi-behavior sequential recommendation. GRACE introduces a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tokenization method that encodes user-item interactions with explicit attributes from product knowledge graphs (e.g., category, brand, price) over semantic tokenization, enabling interpretable and behavior-aligned generation. To address the inefficiency of standard attention, we design a Journey-Aware Sparse Attention (JSA) mechanism, which selectively attends to compressed, intra-, inter-, and current-context segments in the tokenized sequence. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that GRACE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to +106.9\% HR@10 and +106.7\% NDCG@10 improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Home domain, and +22.1\% HR@10 on the Electronics domain. GRACE also reduces attention computation by up to 48\% with long sequences.},

In this paper, we propose a semantic segmentation method based on a dynamic multimodal noise addition technique combined with the SegFormer model to improve the robustness of street view image segmentation in complex environments. The study takes five major roads (West Beijing Road, North Taiping Road, Changjiang Road, Yihe Road, and Central Road) in Nanjing as objects, and based on the streetscape and remote sensing data of the vegetation growth season from 2017 to 2022, the Gaussian noise, motion blur, and weather effects are simulated by the multimodal noise addition technique, which effectively improves the adaptability of the model to the dynamic interference. The experiments showed that the Green View Index analysis revealed a general upward trend of street greening (average increase of 0.94\%). Furthermore, the Kendall rank correlation analysis reveals the positive correlation between environmental factors and green visualization rate, and the influence law of environmental factors on green perception is verified. This study provides a high-precision computer vision analysis framework for urban greening planning and promotes the application of semantic segmentation models in complex urban scenes.},

  abstract = {The progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fueled AI-powered tools like co-pilots and assistants to provision better guidance, particularly during data analysis. However, research on guidance has not yet examined the perceived efficacy of the source from which guidance is offered and the impact of this source on the user’s perception and usage of guidance. We ask whether users perceive all guidance sources as equal, with particular interest in three sources: (i) “AI,” (ii) “human expert,” and (iii) “a group of human analysts.” As a benchmark, we consider a fourth source, (iv) “unattributed guidance,” where guidance is provided without attribution to any source, enabling isolation of and comparison with the effects of source-specific guidance. We design a five-condition between-subjects study, with one condition for each of the four guidance sources and an additional (v) “no-guidance” condition, which serves as a baseline to evaluate the influence of any kind of guidance. We situate our study in a custom data preparation and analysis tool wherein we task users to select relevant attributes from an unfamiliar dataset to inform a business report. Depending on the assigned condition, users can request guidance, which the system then provides in the form of attribute suggestions. To ensure internal validity, we control for the quality of guidance across source-conditions. Through several metrics of usage and perception, we statistically test five preregistered hypotheses and report on additional analysis. We find that the source of guidance matters to users, but not in a manner that matches received wisdom. For instance, users utilize guidance differently at various stages of analysis, including expressing varying levels of regret, despite receiving guidance of similar quality. Notably, users in the AI condition reported both higher post-task benefit and regret. These findings strongly indicate the need to further understand how different guidance sources impact user behavior for designing effective guidance systems.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models capable of complex tasks are revolutionizing areas previously considered to define humanity, such as creativity, design, and knowledge work. Research reports that Human-GAI co-creation processes can enhance creativity and even foster a sense of empowerment. A key innovation is the intent-based outcome specification, where users define desired results through natural language, sketches, or gestures, thus shifting control from users to AI models. This paradigm enables new forms of co-creation while presenting challenges in creating effective and safe outcome specifications.This workshop aims to investigate the design, implementation, and evaluation of intent-based co-creative experiences that boost human creativity in work, play, and education across text, images, audio, code, and video. Key questions focus on how creativity support can guide generative AI development and how to leverage generative models for positive user experiences. By uniting researchers and practitioners from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and AI, the workshop seeks to deepen understanding of human-AI co-creative interactions and explore opportunities and challenges in developing meaningful and safe generative systems.},

Drawing on inspiration from the Computer Science field of feature visualization, we investigate the materiality of our prototype, a GAN model trained to generate fashion imagery, and show how Hidden Layer Interaction offers an alternative to standard prompting. In doing so, we illustrate how this change in approach leads to new forms of interaction with the internal semantics of generative AI, and demonstrate how one might use Hidden Layer Interaction to engage with AI as a material in design.},

To comprehensively assess how AI has influenced students' learning, we apply a targeted questionnaire, gathering information about students' basic information, situation about internet usage, learning needs, and attitudes towards AI tools. Based on 4,606 valid responses, we construct a hierarchical evaluation model, and make correlation analysis accordingly. The result has shown that the influence of AI is general, particularly for students who are in lower-grade or majored in science and engineering fields, and the problem of lack of experience and professionalism is common. Objective conditions and motivation have played a crucial role. To make sensible use of AI in study, the educators may consider giving tips of transparent policy, offering personalized instructions, bettering the access of intelligent tools, and motivating students' self-directed learning.},

  abstract = {Programming students have a widespread access to powerful Generative AI tools like ChatGPT.     While this can help understand the learning material and assist with exercises, educators are voicing more and more concerns about an overreliance on generated outputs and lack of critical thinking skills.     It is thus important to understand how students actually use generative AI and what impact this could have on their learning behavior.     To this end, we conducted a study including an exploratory experiment with 37 programming students, giving them monitored access to ChatGPT while solving a code authoring exercise.     The task was not directly solvable by ChatGPT and required code comprehension and reasoning.    While only 23 of the students actually opted to use the chatbot, the majority of those eventually prompted it to simply generate a full solution.    We observed two prevalent usage strategies: to seek knowledge about general concepts and to directly generate solutions.    Instead of using the bot to comprehend the code and their own mistakes, students often got trapped in a vicious cycle of submitting wrong generated code and then asking the bot for a fix.    Those who self-reported using generative AI regularly were more likely to prompt the bot to generate a solution.    Our findings indicate that concerns about potential decrease in programmers' agency and productivity with Generative AI are justified.    We discuss how researchers and educators can respond to the potential risk of students uncritically over-relying on Generative AI.    We also discuss potential modifications to our study design for large-scale replications.},

Defined by its ability to create or modify content, GenAI differs significantly from traditional machine learning models that classify, recognize, or predict patterns from existing data. This study explores the role of GenAI in shaping perceptions of AI's contribution and how these perceptions influence both creators’ internal assessments of their work and their anticipation of external evaluators’ assessments. Our research develops and empirically tests a structural model through a between-subjects experiment, revealing that the role GenAI plays in the work process significantly impacts perceived enhancements in work quality and effort relative to human input. Additionally, we identify a critical trade-off between fostering worker assessments of creativity and managing perceived external assessments of the work's value.},

  abstract = {We conduct an incentivized laboratory experiment to study people's perception of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) alignment in the context of economic decision-making. Using a panel of economic problems spanning the domains of risk, time preference, social preference, and strategic interactions, we ask human subjects to make choices for themselves and to predict the choices made by GenAI on behalf of a human user. These problems confront agents with trade-offs (e.g., higher payoff vs. earlier payoff, efficiency vs. equity, riskier but potentially higher rewards vs. safer but lower rewards) and the optimal choices depend on the agent's preferences. We find that people overestimate the degree to which GenAI choices are aligned with human preferences in general (anthropomorphic projection), and with their personal references in particular (self projection). On average, human subjects' predictions about GenAI's choices in every decision environment are much closer to the average human-subject choice than to the average GenAI choice. At the individual level, human subjects' predictions about GenAI's choices in a given environment are highly correlated with their own choices in the same environment.We explore the implications of anthropomorphic projection and self projection in a stylized theoretical model. Our theoretical analysis shows that anthropomorphic projection and self projection can lead to over-delegation to GenAI. More subtly, we also find that objectively improving AI alignment can harm agents who exhibit anthropomorphic projection (because they mistakenly adjust their delegation decisions in a detrimental fashion). Similarly, among agents who exhibit self projection, welfare may be higher for those who have more unusual preferences (since they are less likely to mistakenly delegate).The full paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14708},

We tested the quality of the intervention using heuristics methodology adapted to the target population along with inputs from African American/ Black medical professionals and UX designers.Key findings highlight the unique needs of the African American/Black communities for culturally relevant content that is accessible to users with varying language levels and tailored to users’ geographical location. Concerning the interaction, high levels of personalization and control over the interaction can promote the use of the tool, by minimizing complexity and maximizing accessibility.These findings show the novel contribution offered by our study in the domain of designing health technology with generative AI, particularly LLMS, for African American/Black communities.},

  abstract = {A design method card deck helps designers understand and provoke thinking by presenting each method in a simple format and allow designers to switch between methods seamlessly by maintaining the same simple format across the deck. However, recent observations have shown designers hesitate to use a card deck due to the lack of support, while other tools have provided identified support with generative AI. Through a formative study, we identified the specific support designers need when applying the design method cards and intentions in integrating generative AI. Accordingly, we developed the intelligent design method card deck, I-Card, which integrates generative AI to provide applicable design methods, design knowledge and data support, and interactive and dynamic support. A user study demonstrates that I-Card improved the design efficiency and applicability by offering personalized guidance, enhanced decision-making with comprehensive data generation and provided more design inspiration via interactive support.},

  abstract = {Conceptual design is an important stage in industrial product development, influenced by the design space and materials available to designers. Advancements in human-computer interaction&nbsp;(HCI) and artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI) technologies have broadened these aspects considerably. On the one hand, augmented reality&nbsp;(AR) technologies merge physical and virtual representations to enhance intuitive interaction and embodied cognition. On the other hand, generative artificial intelligence&nbsp;(GAI) serves as a novel design material, boosting creativity and productivity. Inspired by these technological strides, we proposed an Intelli-Embodied Design Space&nbsp;(IEDS), which integrates designers, AR, and GAI to support industrial conceptual design by combining embodied interaction with generative variability. Within IEDS, designers can interact with the physical prototypes intuitively, while GAI refines these into virtual forms that can be embedded in the physical world through AR technology. In this study, we established the theoretical framework and interaction modes of IEDS through literature reviews and expert interviews. Subsequently, we designed and implemented three GAI+AR tools, GAI + Head-mounted Display&nbsp;(HMD), GAI + Handheld Display&nbsp;(HHD), and GAI + Spatial Augmented Reality&nbsp;(SAR), based on three AR approaches in IEDS to practically examine the benefits and challenges of these interaction modes across industrial conceptual design tasks. We discussed IEDS’s influence on industrial conceptual design and released its application guidelines to the HCI community.},

In a pilot study with 37 fifth-graders, we explored how children (ages 9–10) envision genAI and the roles they believe it should play in their daily life. Our findings reveal three key ways children envision genAI: as a companion providing guidance, a collaborator working alongside them, and a task automator that offloads responsibilities. However, alongside these hopeful views, children expressed fears about overreliance, particularly in academic settings, linking it to fears of diminished learning, disciplinary consequences, and long-term failure. This study highlights the need for child-centric AI design that balances these tensions, empowering children with the skills to critically engage with and navigate their evolving relationships with digital technologies.},

However, using IGAI has challenges, such as encoded biases, which might reinforce stereotypes and harm underrepresented communities. We conducted a case study to explore how using IGAI alters the co-design process of public parks through public engagement. We use data collected from interviews with immigrants discussing the Puente Hills Landfill Park design in Los Angeles, which will re-purpose a former landfill into a new public park. We use Dream Studio as a Design Probe, generating images from the interviewees’ insights and critically reflecting on the design process through internal interviews and a reflective workshop. We analyze our case in three domains: Opportunities, Risks and Challenges, and Features and Requirements. In the opportunities domain, we discuss how the enhanced translation of words to images changes the relationship between stakeholder engagement, multiplicity, and efficiency. In the risks and challenges domain, we discuss how IGAI might enhance power imbalances and biases. Finally, we reflect on what features would ease the safe and responsible use of IGAI to engage citizens in co-designing public parks.},

Although there have been attempts to bring AI literacy to children, commonly via game-based learning, there is still a lack of instruction that aims to encourage a more nuanced understanding of the utility and harm of GenAI systems to a broader audience. To address the gap, we developed the educational game ImaginAItion, inspired by existing popular party game mechanisms such as Telestrations and Caution Signs. In particular, our game targets adults who do not have a deep understanding of GenAI. Leveraging persuasive strategies grounded in psychological theories, we seek to encourage deeper reflection on players’ GenAI prompting behaviors and their understanding of its capabilities and limitations.},

  abstract = {Graph classification has significant applications in various domains, including chemical molecular structure prediction, social network analysis, recommendation systems, and biological network analysis, and has received considerable attention in recent years. However, real-world graph datasets often exhibit class imbalance, where the disproportionate distribution of classes can cause models to favor the majority class, reducing prediction accuracy for minority classes. Notably, minority or anomalous classes often hold unique value in many practical scenarios. This paper proposes a framework for graph classification under category imbalance named Generator Imbalanced Graph Classification(GIGC). GIGC employs a set of learnable augmented graph generators orchestrated by an automated augmentation strategy to enhance minority-class graphs. This approach increases the diversity of minority-class samples, balances the dataset's class distribution, and improves the model's generalization capabilities. Simultaneously, k-reciprocal nearest neighbors are utilized to capture inter-graph relationships more effectively, leveraging the properties of symmetry and reciprocity. Subsequently, Graph-of-Graph Neural Networks are used to model inter-graph relationships, capturing global associations between graphs at a higher level. This enables the model to better capture and utilize inter-graph information. By leveraging the latent connections between minority-class graphs and other graphs, GIGC enriches the representation of minority-class graphs, mitigating the negative effects of class imbalance on classification performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that GIGC outperforms baseline methods in graph classification. Specifically, F1-macro and F1-micro are improved by at least 1.12\% and 2.62\%, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of GIGC in addressing class imbalance in graph classification tasks.},

We focus a lot on AI-powered chatbots—these tools not only offer round-the-clock academic help, but also help students with administrative tasks, like figuring out class schedules or financial aid information. By reviewing various studies, we see that AI often leads to better engagement and improved learning outcomes. In this study, we use surveys and data analysis to capture students' thoughts about AI in their day-to-day studies. Our findings suggest that while AI holds a lot of promise for making education more accessible and effective, we need to be careful and thoughtful about how we roll it out so all students can really benefit.},

While large language models (LLMs) have made it feasible to build generative AI chatbots that simulate conversation, creating an AI-powered language tutor that is both pedagogically effective and engaging for learners requires solving a host of additional problems. At Duolingo, we have developed an AI conversational tutor embedded in our platform, featuring a character named Lily, who helps users practice real-world conversations in their target language. In building this system, we tackled multiple challenges: adapting dialogue to each learner's proficiency level, sustaining personalized and coherent interactions across sessions, maintaining consistent character-driven personality, and designing a structure that supports both guided and learner-initiated topics. Our solution integrates a three-party conversational architecture, a persistent memory mechanism to retain prior interactions, and real-time conversation evaluation to dynamically adjust to the learner's input. This talk will highlight how generative AI, when coupled with rigorous feedback loops and thoughtful design, can significantly enhance the language learning experience.},

The importance of this problem is not only defined in the dissatisfaction among customers, but also in the direct impact on profits due to the economic loss due to unfulfilled orders. Significant efforts have been made to address this issue, including the proposal of an improvement model that seeks to increase efficiency through standard working practices, SMED, AI and RCM. The motivation to solve these problems lies in the need to improve the efficiency and profitability of companies in the graphic sector, as well as in customer satisfaction.

The validation of the proposed model was carried out through simulations in the Arena software and its implementation was in a Peruvian company dedicated to the printing of self-adhesive labels. The main result achieved was a 13.3\% increase in the efficiency indicator of the ILMA 340 printer (from 63 to 76.3\%), a 27\% reduction in machine assembly times (from 90.5 to 65.3 minutes) and an increase in the average time between failures by 53.4\% (from 30.0 to 46.5 hours). In conclusion, the improvement model managed to overcome the technical gap, increasing efficiency and productivity for companies in the graphic sector, which contributes to customer satisfaction and increased profits.},

We use speculative and critical design as our approach to avoid abstract guesswork and provide more nuanced and concrete insights into the matter at hand. We conducted five speculative design workshops centered on Infinity Book, a fictional system capable of generating any kind of literary work. Participants used brainwriting, the Future Ripples method, and dialogue-labs to explore potential futures and socio-material impacts of such technology. Reflexive Thematic Analysis was employed to analyze the results from the workshops, and we developed twelve design fictions that illustrate diverse uses and societal implications of GenAI. Based on these results, we formulated three strong concepts, Authenticity, Creative Agency, and Liveness, that link concrete design considerations with broader philosophical discussions.},

We present a new perspective on IR research in which the users of an IR system are intelligent agents instead of human users. Extending the current work on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we identify five novel IR tasks that an intelligent agent must be able to perform in order to achieve Human-Level Artificial Intelligence, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), including 1) External Information Retrieval (EIR) to access new information unseen by the agent, 2) Provenance Information Retrieval (PIR) to trace the provenance of information, 3) Curriculum Information Retrieval (CIR) to actively acquire the most useful new data and information for lifelong learning, 4) Rule Information Retrieval (RIR) to perform reasoning and problem solving, and 5) Scenario Information Retrieval (SIR) to leverage past scenarios for problem solving and decision making. We compare these new IR tasks with the traditional IR tasks performed by an IR system that serves human users and systematically examine the challenges involved in the five new IR tasks, providing a roadmap for new IR research within the broader context of AGI development.},

  abstract = {The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI is fundamentally transforming information retrieval and processing on the Internet, bringing both great potential and significant concerns regarding content authenticity and reliability. This paper presents a novel quantitative approach to shed light on the complex information dynamics arising from the growing use of generative AI tools. Despite their significant impact on the digital ecosystem, these dynamics remain largely uncharted and poorly understood. We propose a stochastic model to characterize the generation, indexing, and dissemination of information in response to new topics. This scenario particularly challenges current LLMs, which often rely on real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to overcome their static knowledge limitations. Our findings suggest that the rapid pace of generative AI adoption, combined with increasing user reliance, can outpace human verification, escalating the risk of inaccurate information proliferation across digital resources. An in-depth analysis of Stack Exchange data confirms that high-quality answers inevitably require substantial time and human effort to emerge. This underscores the considerable risks associated with generating persuasive text in response to new questions and highlights the critical need for responsible development and deployment of future generative AI tools.},

On the basis of analyzing the operation mechanism and technical characteristics of Data Mining, there are four forms of infringement of personal information Data Mining. Specific manifestations are as follows: manifested as data labeling and unfavorable evaluation, information cocoons and passive autonomy, social sorting and data discrimination, information association and personal privacy infringement. The automatic decision-making and black box of Data Mining, the constructiveness and hiding of mining infringement behaviors, and the difficulty and challenge of infringement results pose the challenges and shortcomings of the current infringement law of personal information Data Mining in China. Finally puts forward the path to improve the legal protection of personal information, that is introducing the rules of due process, restricting the data power of Data Mining organizations, and establishing channels and procedures for effective interaction between Data Mining organizations and subjects of personal information.},

Little space is given to laypeople – who have to adapt to and adopt the genAI innovations – to share their opinions and experiences. Addressing this gap, we organized 6h/3.5h laypeople dialogues in Nigeria, Japan, and Germany in July and August 2024. During the dialogues, participants discussed what a desirable future in light of genAI development could look like in one of three contexts: education, public service, and arts \&amp; culture. Participants explored the consequences of technology deployment, assessed the risks, mapped stakeholders, and derived measures to achieve a desirable goal. This study contributes to policy debates on genAI by providing recommendations derived from participants’ identified requirements and suggested measures for genAI to create value and to foster a socially desirable future. We reflect on the results through a cross-national lens.},

Through an empirical case study involving 10 vocational schools and 15 industry partners, we demonstrate how AI tools can improve pedagogical efficiency, skills acquisition and employability. The framework also addresses technical challenges, such as rapid obsolescence and human resistance, and provides actionable insights for educators and policymakers to optimise AI-powered vocational systems.},

This work explores the integration of AI tool in microelectronics engineering education, focusing on the results and adaptions made in a course based on an informal survey of graduate students in a semester long VLSI Electronic Design Automation seminar. Exploration of 23 anonymous student responses indicate high student familiarity with general generative AI but lower exposure to task specific tools, and lowest exposure to domain-specific EDA AI tools. Students report using AI frequently for coding assistance and understanding complex concepts, while exercising caution by verifying AI outputs. AI is perceived as beneficial and most students do not consider themselves heavily reliant on the tools for their own success. Open-ended responses highlight enthusiasm about AI’s efficiency benefits though tempered with concerns about accuracy. These course-specific insights informed course design which includes: incorporating AI literacy into VLSI/EDA curricula, designing AI-centric assignments, and updating assessment strategies to promote critical thinking and human-to-human interactions, collaboration and communication. We offer several recommendations for microelectronics educators to adapt pedagogy in alignment with evolving industry practices and student needs.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has made remarkable achievements in the field of artificial intelligence. However, a well-trained deep neural network is at risk of being tampered with. Although some model watermarking schemes have been proposed to solve this problem, most of them are only oriented to discriminant models, and the integrity authentication schemes for generative models are urgently lacking. Especially, the integrity authentication problem of Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) that plays an important role in computer vision has not been properly solved. To address this problem, we propose a fragile model watermarking framework for GANs. Specifically, we use a secret key to generate specific information as the label, and combine it with the watermark to form a trigger set. Then, we use the trigger set to train the GAN, the training process does not damage the model performance. We can achieve integrity authentication of the GAN using the output of the GAN for the specific label. A large number of experiments show that our proposed method has excellent performance, which can realize the integrity authentication of GANs. What’s more, the proposed method has good generalization and can be easily applied to different GAN architectures.},

  abstract = {There are a large number of violations of safety regulations at the construction site of the power grid. These behaviors do not comply with safety supervision norms and can cause significant safety hazards. In response to the problem of difficulty in capturing and alerting such violations, we have designed an intelligent recognition system for violations based on enhanced YOLOv5 and generative visual big models to automatically detect violations and potential safety hazards at the construction site of the power grid. We have constructed a private dataset of violations at the construction site of the power grid. In our improved YOLOv5 model, we first added a spatial channel attention mechanism to the Neck section of Yolov5 to enhance its ability to extract spatial features and distinguish between different channel features, enabling the network to better distinguish different targets. In addition, we have added a spatial attention mechanism after the SPP of the backbone network, which enables the network to fully utilize spatial information, extract more prominent features, and improve the accuracy and recall of the model. In addition, to compensate for the lack of negative samples in the dataset, we use a generative visual model to generate a large number of negative sample images to enhance the dataset and address the issue of insufficient negative samples. We have designed a real-time safety supervision intelligent system for detecting violations on construction sites based on the above model and method, using IoT devices such as on-site real-time cameras, intermediate data servers, and routers. We conducted extensive experiments on real construction site datasets, and the results showed that our method has significantly improved compared to the original model. The MAP of the system is 94.0\%, indicating that the model has strong detection ability and robustness in identifying personnel and safety tools in power grid construction site scenarios.},

Current evaluations primarily depend on subjective questionnaire data or code quality metrics. A supplemental objective, continuous, real-time developer-centered measure is missing. Wearables with body sensors that measure the physiological activity of a person have the aforementioned benefits. With their help, impeding factors from GenAI tools on a developer's well-being and cognitive load may be detected. Implications for productivity may be deduced from these cognitive load measures. This research aims to use body sensor data to (1) assess the ability of wearables to measure developers' cognitive load in their everyday working context to then (2) evaluate developer experience, productivity and GenAI interactions in real-life work environments. A holistic mixed-method approach by combining subjective and objective measures in a developer-centered manner is taken.},

This paper critically examines the multifaceted adoption of GenAI in HE by reviewing interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks from psychology, computer science, and pedagogy. It highlights the insufficiency of traditional technology acceptance models, which predominantly address cognitive and rational decision-making processes, and advocates for the inclusion of emotional and ethical dimensions often overlooked in existing frameworks. By synthesizing research across various disciplines, this review identifies significant gaps and proposes an integrated theoretical model to effectively understand and guide GenAI adoption. The proposed framework emphasizes the need for robust, empirically supported methodologies that accommodate the complex, dynamic nature of GenAI applications. This paper not only contributes to academic discourse by providing a comprehensive review of existing literature but also sets a foundation for future empirical studies aimed at refining GenAI integration strategies in HE, ensuring they are ethically aligned and educationally effective.},

  abstract = {The remarkable advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has driven revolutionary applications for text-to-image generation, like Stable Diffusion and Imagen. Especially, the diffusion model can generate stunning images from natural language descriptions by using a reverse continuous denoising process. However, the computation burden of diffusion model-based GenAI services poses a significant hurdle for their practical implementation. In this work, we propose a novel edge computing-assisted GenAI framework to enable efficient GenAI service provision, where the intermediate output generated by diffusion models can be cached on edge servers and reused by various users to improve edge computing resource utilization. Assuming the existence of causally correlated auxiliary information, a long-term caching problem is formulated under intra-time-slot caching constraints by considering various maximally reusable steps of diffusion model-based GenAI tasks and the available caching capacity at edge servers. By leveraging the Lyapunov optimization framework, we transform the time-average caching problem into several deterministic problems for different time slots. We develop a deep reinforcement learning-based caching (DRC) algorithm to obtain caching decisions in each time slot, where a deep neural network (DNN)-based caching action generation module and a model-based evaluation module are designed. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation experiments by comparing the DRC algorithm with benchmark algorithms. The simulation results depict that the proposed DRC algorithm can reduce response time and improve cache hit rates significantly. The code is available at https://gitee.com/pipihinsky/DRC.},

To allow for the development and testing of new algorithms adapted to this new data landscape, test problems are necessary as a way to both evaluate and compare algorithms performances. However, while recent advances extended known test problems such as the r-Leading-Ones marking the transition from binary to multi-valued variables, having different data-types coexisting in the search space is still an open question. We propose the h-Leading-Ones as an extension of the r-Leading-Ones to evaluate the ability of an algorithm to solve problems on a search space composed of multi-valued and real-valued data types. Its design with dependency between the different data-types and its continuity with the r-Leading-Ones provides a convenient new environment for benchmark and runtime analysis for mixed-category search spaces.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly creating a place for themselves in society. There are numerous reports, both good and bad, of their use in business, academia, government and society. While some organizations are trying to limit, or eliminate, their use, it appears that it is inevitable they will become a common "tool". In education, there is a fear that students will not acquire critical thinking in the future, but we argue that LLMs will become a tool to assist students with critical thinking, giving guidance, feedback, and assessment. This paper investigates how the current state of LLMs can be integrated into modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) education. Example cases for modeling and simulation development are presented showing how an LLM can assist M&amp;S design and education in anticipation of LLMs becoming a common tool for M&amp;S practitioners. Current limitations are also highlighted, and where possible, short-term solutions are proposed.},

This study investigates how engaging young people in the design and auditing of generative language models (GLMs) may foster the development of their understanding of how these systems work from both technical and ethical perspectives. The study takes an in-pieces approach to investigate novices’ conceptions of GLMs. Such an approach supports the analysis of how technical and ethical conceptions evolve and relate to each other. I am currently conducting a series of participatory design workshops with sixteen ninth graders (ages 14–15) in which they will (a) build GLMs from a data-driven perspective that glassboxes how data shapes model performance and (b) audit commercial GLMs by repeatedly and systematically querying them to draw inferences about their behaviors. I will analyze participants’ interactions to identify ethical and technical conceptions they may exhibit while designing and auditing GLMs. Then I will investigate the contexts in which these conceptions emerge and how participants’ personal interests and prior experiences may relate to their conceptions. I will also conduct clinical interviews and use microgenetic knowledge analysis and ordered network analysis to investigate how participants’ ethical and technical conceptions of GLMs relate to each other and change after the workshop. The study will contribute (a) evidence of how engaging youth in design and auditing activities may support the development of ethical and technical understanding of GLMs and (b) an inventory of novice design and auditing practices that may support youth’s technical and ethical understanding of GLMs.},

  abstract = {Isambard-AI is a new, leadership-class supercomputer, designed to support AI-related research. Based on the HPE Cray EX4000 system, and housed in a new, energy efficient Modular Data Centre in Bristol, UK, Isambard-AI employs 5,448 NVIDIA Grace-Hopper GPUs to deliver over 21 ExaFLOP/s of 8-bit floating point performance for LLM training, and over 250 PetaFLOP/s of 64-bit performance, for under 5MW. Isambard-AI integrates two, all-flash storage systems: a 20 PiByte Cray ClusterStor and a 3.5 PiByte VAST solution. Combined these give Isambard-AI flexibility for training, inference and secure data accesses and sharing. But it is the software stack where Isambard-AI will be most different from traditional HPC systems. Isambard-AI is designed to support users who may have been using GPUs in the cloud, and so access will more typically be via Jupyter notebooks, MLOps, or other web-based, interactive interfaces, rather than the approach used on traditional supercomputers of ssh'ing into a system before submitting jobs to a batch scheduler. Its stack is designed to be quickly and regularly upgraded to keep pace with the rapid evolution of AI software, with full support for containers. Phase 1 of Isambard-AI is due online in May/June 2024, with the full system expected in production by the end of the year.},

  abstract = {The demand for efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference has surged with the rising adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) applications, particularly in areas such as agents and retrieval-augmented generation. Efficient inference serves two crucial purposes: it enables the deployment of LLM-centered applications that address critical business needs, while also facilitating rapid experimentation for researchers to extract valuable insights and new understandings. However, despite the field's rapid advancement and interdisciplinary nature, there remains a limited exchange of ideas and methodologies between production-facing practitioners and researchers seeking to experiment with new GenAI concepts quickly. To bridge this gap, we are introducing the first KDD workshop on Inference Optimization for Generative AI. Our goal is to create a collaborative platform where researchers and practitioners working across various use cases and stacks of efficient inference can come together to exchange research ideas, establish connections between different disciplines, and identify challenges and research questions that will shape future work.},

Knowledge management recognizes the explicit knowledge that workers contribute to an organization, as well as the organizational knowledge and skills acquired over time. The potential impact of generative AI (GenAI) raises many issues and opportunities related to effective knowledge management as organizations explore the impact and implications of its adoption. This research explores issues related to an increasing world of GenAI and proposes a Framework for Knowledge Management in the GenAI Era. Knowledge management workers, who are novices, might be more inclined to use generative AI for performing their tasks. Expert knowledge workers might focus on quality evaluation and quality assessment. Adoption of GenAI may help with the progression from novice to expert, while freeing up time and resources for other work. Challenges include the potential loss of critical organizational knowledge, definition of job-related requirements, expectations, and tasks, as well as over-reliance and loss of tacit or unarticulated knowledge. These challenges must be balanced against available access to large amounts of general and domain-specific knowledge from GenAI to capture the value realized from its adoption.},

  abstract = {Shipboard emergencies can easily induce secondary events because of any time and space transition. Carrier-based aircraft emergencies have complexity, tight coupling and strong real-time characteristics. Therefore, it is of great significance to reasonably predict the development trend of the incident in the emergency treatment to reduce the harm. Due to the sudden and random nature of naval battlefield accidents, some incidents are not covered by the historical case base. Traditional retrieval approaches to event prediction using case knowledge are limited by the sparsity of events and the cold-start problem. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-graph neural network for event development trend prediction, which disassembles events into event features and introduces the shipboard aircraft domain knowledge graph. We produce a data set around the event features of carrier-based aircraft on the simulation platform. The results show that the graph neural network with knowledge graph is superior in modeling the higher-order semantic association between event features. Compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods, our approach exhibits significant improvements.},

The conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. Over the years, the conference has evolved and is now one of the most relevant venues for discussion of the highest quality research on how learning and teaching can be transformed by technology.The aim of L@S is to address real-world educational challenges and simultaneously contribute to a fundamental understanding of human learning. Together, our goal is to investigate how data and technology can be leveraged to create more responsible and effective learning experiences for all learners across the globe. The theme of L@S 2025 is Learning Synergies @ Scale. As technology continues to reshape education, at the L@S 2025 conference we explore how generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its new possibilities can be leveraged to better support learning across the lifespan. L@S 2025 explores the impact of AI on learning with an emphasis on scalability and the broader impact of technological advances in learning environments. As a community we address the challenges of applying scalable, technology-driven solutions in both structured institutional environments and dynamic, self-directed learning communities, especially those that provide actionable insights for equitable and effective adaptive learning experiences. Creating synergies between research and practice, and contributing to breaking down barriers between the two, we present research co-informed by practice at scale.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have revolutionized information retrieval and content generation, opening up new opportunities for the e-commerce industry. Alignment learning between small models and parallel corpora cannot meet current needs. The success of ChatGPT demonstrates that large models need to first establish a fundamental understanding, and then utilize high-quality corpora for generation. Having a large model foundation is indispensable. In this paper, we establish a fundamental 10B multimodal model foundation for multimodal generation tasks and propose a scene-based alignment learning approach called conditional sample supervised fine-tuning for downstream generation tasks. Meanwhile, diffusion models are known to be vulnerable to outliers in training data. To address this, we utilize an alternative diffusion loss function that preserves the high quality of generated data like the original squared L2 loss while being robust to outliers.In practical test sets, the multimodal foundation fully demonstrates its alignment and comprehension abilities for graphic and textual content. Additionally, conditional fine-tuning and the design of the loss function significantly enhance the quality of generated content. The quality rate of images has increased by 34.3 percentage points, and prompt control has improved by 19.8 percentage points. The application of our framework in Baidu Search Ads has led to significant revenue growth. For instance, ads with generated image creatives have achieved a 29\% higher click-through rate (CTR), resulting in a daily consumption of 3 million yuan.},

  abstract = {Generative AI has emerged as a transformative technology capable of reshaping public sector operations by streamlining administrative tasks, enhancing data analytics, and driving more personalized citizen interactions. Despite its potential, a critical gap remains in understanding how generative AI can be effectively integrated into government processes, particularly in developing countries like Indonesia, where bureaucratic inefficiencies and infrastructural constraints persist. This study addresses this gap by conducting a mixed-method investigation that combines a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of generative AI applications across multiple sectors to inform public service innovation, with expert interviews from key stakeholders Indonesian government, academic, and industry. The findings indicate that generative AI holds substantial promise for reducing manual processes, improving inter-agency coordination, and fostering data-driven decision-making. However, challenges related to ethical considerations, data privacy, and limited digital infrastructure present significant barriers to widespread adoption. By proposing a governance framework and offering strategic recommendations tailored to the Indonesian context, this research provides actionable insights for policymakers, government agencies, and technology providers. In doing so, it contributes to the evolving discourse on AI-driven public service innovation and offers a pathway toward realizing a more efficient and citizen-focused smart government in Indonesia.},

  abstract = {The emergence of foundational models and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is poised to transform productivity in scientific computing, especially in code development, refactoring, and translating from one programming language to another. However, because the output of GenAI cannot be guaranteed to be correct, manual intervention remains necessary. Some of this intervention can be automated through task-specific tools, alongside additional methodologies for correctness verification and effective prompt development. We explored the application of GenAI in assisting with code translation, language interoperability, and codebase inspection within a legacy Fortran codebase used to simulate particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the process, we developed a tool, CodeScribe, which combines prompt engineering with user supervision to establish an efficient process for code conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate how CodeScribe assists in converting Fortran code to C++, generating Fortran-C APIs for integrating legacy systems with modern C++ libraries, and providing developer support for code organization and algorithm implementation. We also address the challenges of AI-driven code translation and highlight its benefits for enhancing productivity in scientific computing workflows.},

Globally, medical AI has tremendous potential to support the United Nations’ sustainable development goals pertaining to health and well-being. In particular, large language models (LLMs) afford opportunities for positively disrupting medical AI-related research and practice. We present a research framework for LLMs in medical AI. Our framework considers the interplay between health and well-being goals, disease lifecycle stages, and the important emerging role of LLMs in medical AI processes related to various lifecycle stages. As part of our framework, we describe the LLM multiplex—important multimodal, multi-model, multicultural, and multi-responsibility considerations for LLMs in medical AI. We discuss how the five articles in the special issue relate to this framework and are helping us learn about the opportunities and challenges for LLMs in medical AI.},

Given the characteristics of class imbalance and high dimensionality of loan data, data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis are conducted. Based on a comparative analysis of various models, seven machine learning algorithms that demonstrate superior performance are selected for experimental comparison, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. The results indicate that ensemble learning algorithms exhibit higher accuracy and predictive performance compared to single algorithms, with the CatBoost model performing best across various indicators, including AUC. The study identifies key features highly correlated with loan defaults, including loan grade, annual income, loan amount, credit history length, and debt-to-income ratio.},

  abstract = {Generative AI seems poised to transform a wide range of endeavors once thought to be solely the domain of humans—from journalism to legal practice to creative expression—into collaborative activities involving both human and machine. Poetry is no exception, as even general-purpose language models now routinely generate convincing emulations of poetic form. While researchers have closely examined such machine-generated poetry, few have studied human-AI collaboration in poetry writing from a posthuman perspective. Through semi-structured interviews with ten participants in an AI English poetry contest and an analysis of their dialogs with AIs, we summarize the affordances and challenges of such collaborative practice using posthumanism as a lens. We then expose interesting tensions, for example, between human self-expression and the diminished (or relocated) agency that AI collaboration often entails. This collaborative, yet often adversarial, process provides insights into the nature of the posthuman condition as regards creative collaboration between human and machine.},

  abstract = {Graphs, which encode pairwise relations between entities, serve as a fundamental data structure across real-world domains. Many critical applications can be formulated as graph-based tasks, and graph machine learning (GML), from the shallow embedding models to graph neural networks and further advanced to the most powerful graph transformers, has been well-established to automate knowledge discovery and decision-making on graphs. In parallel, the recent emergence of large foundational models has driven machine learning into a new era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), and this revolution presents both unprecedented opportunities and profound challenges for the well-established GML paradigms. However, few investigations have analyzed and envisioned how GML should evolve to harness these opportunities, address these challenges, and embrace this new Gen-AI era. To fill in this gap, we organize the first international Workshop on Machine Learning on Graphs in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (MLoG-GenAI), held in connection with the 31st ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, which provides a venue to gather academic researchers and industry practitioners to discuss and picture the development of GML in the new Gen-AI era.},

Yet, users’ understanding of how such ecosystems work remains unknown. In this paper, we investigate users’ mental models of how GenAI Chatbot Ecosystems work. This is an important question because users’ mental models guide their behaviors, including making decisions that impact their privacy. Through 21 semi-structured interviews, we uncovered users’ four mental models towards first-party (e.g., Google Gemini) and third-party (e.g., ChatGPT) GenAI Chatbot Ecosystems. These mental models centered around the role of the chatbot in the entire ecosystem. We further found that participants held a more consistent and simpler mental model towards third-party ecosystems than the first-party ones, resulting in higher trust and fewer concerns towards the third-party ecosystems. We discuss the design and policy implications based on our results.},

Traditional contact-based measurement methods face significant limitations in high temperature and extreme environments, such as safety risks, inaccurate measurements due to interference with the environment, and short equipment life. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative non-contact measurement method using a visual depth estimation technique based on deep learning. The MiDaS model captures an image of a liquid metal surface by a monocular camera in an industrial environment. A deep neural network then estimates their depth by processing these images. By calculating the vertical distance between the liquid metal level point and a predefined reference point, real-time and accurate monitoring of the liquid level height is realized. This study not only introduces a new non-contact solution for measuring the height of liquid metal surfaces, but also enhances the potential applications of deep learning in industrial vision measurement and depth estimation.},

Current methods mainly rely on Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs), which effectively capture spatial dependencies but require significant computational resources and limited to short-term forecasting. However, research on time-series data in the transportation field, particularly on sequence prediction across multiple time scales, remains underexplored. To leverage the multi-scale characteristics of time-series data, as well as its seasonal and periodic features, we introduce two solutions based on DLinear model: multi-scale decomposition and cross-scale information fusion, and propose a traffic prediction model named MIFNetwork. We conduct comparative experiments on several traffic datasets, selecting transformer-based models with strong time-series modeling capabilities for comparison. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other approaches, especially in handling long time spans and complex trend changes.},

  abstract = {Information freshness, measured by the Age-of-Information (AoI) metric, is a crucial aspect of conventional network systems. However, the emergence of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) introduces unique requirements for assessing information freshness, rendering the traditional AoI definition inadequate. This is because the traditional AoI metric operates under the presumption that each data packet bears equal significance. In contrast, AIoT systems must prioritize the transmission of event summaries from smart IoT devices. To promptly capture events as they occur at the sources, we propose a novel information freshness metric called Age of Event (AoE). Subsequently, we thoroughly investigate the problem of AoE-minimizing transmission scheduling. This issue presents a formidable challenge because the event occurrence pattern can be unpredictable, and more crucially, the base station only becomes aware of these occurrences post-transmission. In response, we formulate algorithms and conduct a theoretical analysis applicable to scenarios characterized by complete, zero, or partial knowledge of event occurrences. Evaluations performed on a real traffic event dataset reveal that even in the absence of complete knowledge, our algorithms exhibit competitive performance when compared against the clairvoyant benchmark and markedly outperform AoI baselines.},

  abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has exacerbated the challenges of misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information (MDM) within digital ecosystems. These multi-faceted challenges demand a re-evaluation of the digital information lifecycle and a deep understanding of its social impact. An interdisciplinary strategy integrating insights from technology, social sciences, and policy analysis is crucial to address these issues effectively. This article introduces a three-tiered framework to scrutinize the lifecycle of GenAI-driven content from creation to consumption, emphasizing the consumer perspective. We examine the dynamics of consumer behavior that drive interactions with MDM, pinpoints vulnerabilities in the information dissemination process, and advocates for adaptive, evidence-based policies. Our interdisciplinary methodology aims to bolster information integrity and fortify public trust, equipping digital societies to manage the complexities of GenAI and proactively address the evolving challenges of digital misinformation. We conclude by discussing how GenAI can be leveraged to combat MDM, thereby creating a reflective cycle of technological advancement and mitigation.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have revolutionized intelligent systems by enabling machines to produce human-like content across diverse domains. However, their outputs often exhibit unpredictability due to complex and opaque internal semantic states, posing challenges for reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce the AI Uncertainty Principle, a novel theoretical framework inspired by quantum mechanics, to model and quantify the inherent unpredictability in generative AI outputs. By drawing parallels with the uncertainty principle and superposition, we formalize the trade-off between the precision of internal semantic states and output variability. Through comprehensive experiments involving state-of-the-art models and a variety of prompt designs, we analyze how factors such as specificity, complexity, tone, and style influence model behavior. Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts can significantly enhance output predictability and consistency, while excessive complexity or irrelevant information can increase uncertainty. We also show that ensemble techniques, such as Sigma-weighted aggregation across models and prompt variations, effectively improve reliability. Our findings have profound implications for the development of intelligent systems, emphasizing the critical role of prompt engineering and theoretical modeling in creating AI technologies that perceive, reason, and act predictably in the real world.},

In this article, we present ModNEF, an open-source, neuromorphic digital hardware architecture designed for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). ModNEF is based on a modular architecture, where independent modules communicate via point-to-point connections to emulate SNNs. Our architecture offers two neuron models based on the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) model, with a different emulation strategy. The modular nature of ModNEF allows researchers to extend the architecture by developing new modules to emulate different types of neurons or implement online learning rules. ModNEF is a clock-driven emulator, meaning that the neuron state is updated at regular intervals, even in the absence of input data. We evaluated the performance of the emulator using the MNIST and NMNIST datasets, with offline, full-precision training.},

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have emerged to address this challenge, offering the capability to synthesize human motion animations from text prompts. However, the effective integration of AI-generated motion into professional designer workflows remains uncertain. This study proposes MoWa, an authoring tool designed to refine AI-generated human motions to meet professional standards. A formative study with six professional motion designers identified the strengths and weaknesses of AI-generated motions. To address these weaknesses, MoWa utilizes latent space to enhance the expressiveness of motions, making them suitable for use in professional workflows. A user study involving twelve professional motion designers was conducted to evaluate MoWa’s effectiveness in refining AI-generated motions. The results indicated that MoWa streamlines the motion design process and improves the quality of the outcomes. These findings suggest that incorporating latent space into motion design tasks can improve efficiency.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology (IT), the lifestyle of modern society has transformed to a faster pace and is more human-centered. The developments in haptic technology have significantly improved the human-computer interaction. Virtual reality (VR) technology and the metaverse, which highlight personalized experience, have become hotspots of the information application industry. In VR applications, adding haptic feedback to the human-computer interaction process can make the experience more immersive. In recent years, research on virtual haptics has focused on two areas: the use of microcurrents to stimulate mechanoreceptors and the use of virtual haptics to convey information. Multi-channel tactile-force rendering permits realistic touch sensations. This is achieved by utilizing force and tactile feedback methods. It is effective for the users to feel detailed and immersive interactions. This paper presents a detailed review on the developments in microcurrent-based computational frameworks for high-resolution haptic feedback. This work also investigates the modern techniques for high resolution haptic rendering, such as the role of multi-channel simulation and computational modeling techniques. Furthermore, the applications of this technology, challenges, and future directions were elaborated.},

In this study, a multimodal sentiment analysis framework based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology is proposed, aiming at automatically identifying the emotional tendency in online product marketing information. By combining the latest generative AI technology, the model can not only analyze the direct feedback from users, but also capture the potential emotional color. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional single-modal sentiment analysis method, the accuracy of the proposed multimodal model is improved by 15\%, and the recall rate is improved by 12\%. This shows that the model can provide more accurate market insight for enterprises, and help to better understand customer needs, improve product design and optimize marketing strategies. The demonstrated multimodal sentiment analysis framework provides a powerful tool for understanding and responding to consumer sentiment. Future research will further explore how to enhance the generalization ability of the model and how to deal with emotional differences in cross-cultural background more effectively to achieve a wider application in the global scope.},

  abstract = {Existing multimodal knowledge graph reasoning methods often rely on simple weighted averaging or attention mechanisms for multimodal feature fusion, which frequently results in the loss of modality-specific information and fails to fully exploit the complementary relationships between modalities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multimodal knowledge graph reasoning method based on a cross-attention mechanism. The model employs the BERT model to encode textual information, introduces a VGG-16 model with a multi-scale attention module to encode visual information, and utilizes a graph attention mechanism to extract the structural information of the knowledge graph. Additionally, a contrastive learning framework is introduced to reduce semantic inconsistencies between modalities, and a cross-attention mechanism is used to achieve dynamic feature fusion across modalities. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, comparative experiments were conducted on the FB15k-237 and DB15K datasets. The results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing benchmark models on key evaluation metrics such as MRR, Hit@1, Hit@3, and Hit@10, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in multimodal knowledge graph reasoning.},

First, features are extracted using multi-scale receptive fields, key channels are enhanced by combining the channel attention mechanism, and the cross-enhanced fusion module realizes the fusion of MRI and PET features. In addition, Generator 3D is responsible for generating realistic medical images and classifying diseases through the classification header. Discriminator 3D is used to discriminate the realism of the images. Meanwhile, a comprehensive loss function is designed to optimize the generator's performance by combining adversarial loss, correlation loss, mean loss, and classification loss. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality medical images and perform well on the classification task.

Museum in the Classroom (MITC) explores how augmented reality (AR) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) can create an interactive learning experience around museum artifacts. This iPad app allows educators to select historical topics from a curated artifact library, generating AR-based exhibits that students can explore. MITC engages students through interactive AR artifacts, AI-driven chatbots, and AI-generated quiz questions, based on a real exhibition at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University. A formative study with middle schoolers (N = 20) demonstrated that the app increased engagement compared to traditional learning methods. MITC also fostered a playful and comfortable environment to interact with museum artifacts. Our findings suggest that combining AR and AI has the potential to enrich classroom learning and offer a scalable alternative to traditional museum visits.},

  abstract = {It has recently emerged that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly developed and can create realistic speech, images, and video. Although such innovations provide many advantages, they pose major threats to the network's security. The research question of the study will, therefore, be the role and effects of generative artificial intelligence on network security, especially deepfake, artificial intelligence-driven phishing, and multimedia content manipulation. This research uses a case study analysis of real-life experiences of security threats in networked systems to show how generative AI can be misused. The findings reveal that: 1. Generative AI can create highly developed cyberattacks such as deepfake social engineering and AI-supplemented phishing, which use visually and audibly persuasive appeals to manipulate users. 2. The problem with this kind of security threat highlighted by AI is that most traditional security solutions lack awareness of such threats since they are incapable of effective real-time user authentication, over-dependence on visual and biometric verification, and lack of AI-awareness training. 3. There are significant gaps in cybersecurity policies and training. Many organizations lack formal protocols for addressing AI-related security risks, and often, organizations are applying generative AI technologies. In addressing the aforementioned vulnerabilities, the study recommends an improved security model that incorporates deepfake detection, more secure authentication, and even advanced anomaly detection systems. In furtherance, there should be improvements in policy that aim at commanding the AI media, ensuring comprehensive training of the employees on cybersecurity matters, and drives that aim at educating the public on how to enhance the strength for discouraging AI cybercrimes.},

Traditional network security devices adopt isolated protection measures and cannot achieve information sharing, which can only reflect the security of the network from one side. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the current security status of the industrial internet and a prediction of its safety development trend over a certain period are the important directions for the development of industrial internet security. In response to the above issues, this paper proposes to improve the traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and combine it with Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) to carry out security situation risk assessment. To provide network managers with more valuable network security situation information.},

The article first elaborates on some basic knowledge and explains its role in news reporting. Secondly, the introduction of artificial intelligence technology into the digital news production process was discussed preliminarily. The "New 4C Rule" is a fundamental principle in the context of artificial intelligence, which takes appropriate contexts as the starting point, specific communities as the guidance, high-quality content as the core, and links around characters, content, and brands. In this situation, cultivating a positive sense of responsibility among media platforms and improving the media quality of audiences have important practical significance for building a new intelligent news production pattern.},

  abstract = {Generative AI search driven by large language models (LLMs) is reshaping information retrieval by offering end-to-end answers to complex queries, reducing users' reliance on manually browsing and summarizing multiple web pages. However, while this paradigm enhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has historically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can continuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale, fine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In contrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline-spanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation-yet typically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This introduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output cannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it difficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop.To address this limitation, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to reintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search. NExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows engaged users to intervene at key stages-such as refining query decomposition, rating retrieved documents, and editing initial generated responses-and Shadow User Mode, where a personalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted feedback for less interactive users. As these feedback signals serve as valuable resources for refining the whole search pipeline, we also introduce a feedback store mechanism that encourages users to share and monetize their debugging efforts, further incentivizing participation. Furthermore, we envision how these feedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines current search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates interaction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and generation models. By restoring human control over key stages of the generative AI search pipeline, we believe NExT-Search offers a promising direction for building feedback-rich AI search systems that can evolve continuously alongside human feedback.},

In this study, we explore how AI-generated music can augment the journaling experience. Through a formative study, we examined journal writers’ writing patterns, purposes, emotional regulation strategies, and the design requirements for the system that augments journaling experience by journal-based AI-generated music. Based on these insights, we developed NoRe, a system that transforms journal entries into personalized music using generative AI. In a seven-day in-the-wild study (N=15), we investigated user engagement and perceived emotional effectiveness through system logs, surveys, and interviews. Our findings suggest that journal-based music generation could support emotional reflection and provide vivid reminiscence of daily experiences. Drawing from these findings, we discuss design implications for tailoring music to journal writers’ emotional states and preferences.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancements of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have recently led to renewed attention towards approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search and vector databases (VectorDB). Among various ANN methodologies, vector quantization techniques like product quantization (PQ) are widely used to generate space-efficient representations for large-scale dense vectors. However, the code-books generated by PQ often reach several gigabytes in size, making them impractical for web-scale, high-dimensional vectors in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices.In this study, we propose SegPQ, a simple yet effective framework for losslessly compressing codebooks generated by any PQ variants, enabling efficient in-memory vector search on devices with limited memory. SegPQ represents the raw PQ codewords as a trained error-bounded piecewise linear approximation model (ϵ-PLA) and pre-computed low-bit residuals. We theoretically demonstrate that, with high probability, the number of bits per compressed codeword is 1.721 + ⌈log2 ϵOPT⌉, where ϵOPT is the optimal error parameter that can be determined by data characteristics. To accelerate query execution, we further design SIMD-aware query processing algorithms on compressed codebooks to fully exploit the hardware parallelism offered by modern architectures. Extensive experimental studies on real datasets showcase that, for 1 billion vectors, SegPQ reduces PQ codebook memory consumption by up to 4.7x (approx. 851 MB) while incurring only 3.3\% additional query processing overhead caused by decompression.},

The problems of scattered data, untimely manual decision-making, and mismatch between employees and positions are becoming more and more common. Management methods that used to rely on personal experience or fixed rules can't keep up with the pace of business changes now. On the other hand, artificial intelligence, especially deep learning algorithm, brings new and promising solutions, which can handle human resources-related work more efficiently and accurately. This paper discusses the main challenges faced by human resource allocation in artificial intelligence environment, introduces how AI technology can help, and puts forward some improvement strategies using XGBoost algorithm. This model is not only supported by survey data, but also tested in actual scenes. The results show that this method works well and can really optimize the allocation of human resources. We hope that through this research, we can provide some practical suggestions for enterprises to adjust their human resource management in the AI era, and help them maintain their competitive advantage and operate more smoothly.},

  abstract = {The utilization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek is bringing about significant changes in educational practices and learning environments. This alteration underlines the necessity to look into how AI can enhance ethics education for the youth. This research reveals that the capabilities of GAI match up well with the requirements of youth ethics education in four principal ways: (1) crafting immersive, multi-sensory scenarios to boost student interest. By creating such scenarios, students can get more engaged and excited about learning. (2) Employing adaptive methods for precise interventions. This means being able to adjust the teaching approach according to each student's specific situation to make the intervention more effective. (3) Generating personalized content to customize the delivery of knowledge. Every student is different, and personalized content can better meet their individual learning needs. (4) Offering real-time analysis to improve teaching methods. With real-time analysis, teachers can quickly understand how students are doing and make timely adjustments. Based on these connections, this study puts forward a framework that incorporates GAI into crucial parts of the teaching process: integrating comprehensive learning data. This helps to have a more complete understanding of students' learning progress. Developing evidence-based strategies. So that teaching decisions are made with solid evidence. Creating differentiated content. To cater to the diverse needs of students. And assessing outcomes in multiple dimensions. This integration not only enhances the efficiency of moral education but also provides a scalable model for applying AI-driven teaching innovations across different subjects.},

We investigated the effectiveness of converting textbook chapters into AI-generated podcasts and explored the impact of personalizing these podcasts for individual learner profiles. We conducted a 3x3 user study with 180 college students in the United States, comparing traditional textbook reading with both generalized and personalized AI-generated podcasts across three textbook subjects. The personalized podcasts were tailored to students’ majors, interests, and self-described instructional preferences. Our findings show that students found the AI-generated podcast format to be more enjoyable than textbooks and that personalized podcasts led to significantly improved learning outcomes, although this was subject-specific. These results highlight that AI-generated podcasts can offer an engaging and effective modality transformation of textbook material, with personalization enhancing content relevance. We conclude with design recommendations for leveraging AI in education, informed by student feedback.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for natural language understanding and text generation. An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step called LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on improving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as batching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify and map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of both processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators (e.g., GPUs). We observe that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a kernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet user and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and computation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach of designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even in memory-bound kernels.In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the dynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI (PA rallel Decoding with PI M), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that exploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to suitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel characterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware units at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that harmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units (GPU) and hybrid PIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on three broadly-used LLMs (i.e., LLaMA-65B, GPT-3 66B, and GPT-3 175B) show that PAPI achieves 1.8\texttimes{} and 11.1\texttimes{} speedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator (i.e., GPU and PIM) and a state-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively.},

Designing visually compelling casts of characters requires significant skill and consideration, and there is a lack of specialized tools to support this endeavor. We investigate how AI-driven image-generation techniques can empower creatives to explore a variety of visual design possibilities for individual and groups of characters. Informed by interviews with character designers, Paratrouper is a multi-modal system that enables creating and experimenting with multiple permutations for character casts and visualizing them in various contexts as part of a holistic approach to design. We demonstrate how Paratrouper supports different aspects of the character design process, and share insights from its use by eight creators. Our work highlights the interplay between creative agency and serendipity, as well as the visual interrelationships among character aesthetics.},

  abstract = {Current research on the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on adolescent development yields mixed results, and parents are left to navigate this emerging technology without clear support and knowledge. A missing step toward effective digital parenting is understanding parents’ concerns and beliefs. Therefore, this preliminary study explores parental perspectives on the use and impact of GenAI on adolescents aged 13 to 17. We conducted a survey with N = 159 parents from 19 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Findings suggest that most parents are unaware of how their children use GenAI and feel disconnected from them on this topic. Importantly, while parents recognise the opportunities and risks of GenAI, their views vary based on their own familiarity with the technology, with those who use it regularly being significantly more optimistic about its impact on adolescents’ development. These results highlight a gap in digital parenting when it comes to adolescents’ use of GenAI, underscoring the need for a systematic approach to parental support. Future work will expand the survey into a larger-scale study and incorporate adolescents’ perspectives.},

This study presents a 'Three-Tier Three-Driver' personalized teaching reform model that categorizes students into three tiers based on different career trajectories and leverages AI as a driver across three dimensions: teaching content, teaching methods, and assessment.Multiple AI tools and methods like AI teaching assistants, GPT models, knowledge graph construction, Q&amp;A modules, and AI assessment modules are used by the course to design the entire curriculum anew, boost pedagogical practice, and reconstruct assessment schemes.Data were collected from a questionnaire survey with 500 students and were modeled using K-Means clustering, DBSCAN density-based clustering algorithms and random forest models. Results demonstrate significant differences in student behaviors and perceptions related to AI tool usage across the different clusters.Effective use of AI technologies was found to benefit student satisfaction and academic performance. Furthermore, there was a significant association found between AI use times and course satisfaction, however DBSCAN could not detect a group of extreme learners.The study concludes by compiling replicable evidence of AI-driven teaching innovation and discussing existing limitations (such as the limited sample scope) as well as possible directions for future work.The conclusion uncovers GAI-empowered teaching innovation as a good promise for teaching quality improvement and personalized learning promotion for postgraduate education.},

EyeLink 1000 Plus was used; 17 subjects participated in the research (mean age = 21 years, 3 males). The experiment includes three trials: the first is dimensionality reduction, the second is clustering, and the third is a classification problem. Three distinct cognitive styles were identified in addressing the proposed challenges. The proposed association and batch models enable the identification of extreme patterns, which can provide insights into the characteristics of the data. The foundational generative learning algorithm determines the appropriate timing and location for generating new nodes, selects a pattern X, and identifies a subpattern to be encoded by the newly created node, among other decisions. Findings are consistent with the anatomical perspective.},

  abstract = {Simulation is crucial for developing autonomous driving systems, where AI algorithms process sensor data to perceive environments. However, training these algorithms require vast, diverse data, and existing methods face limitations. Manual scene construction in simulation platforms is slow and lacks scalability, while rendering-based approaches often produce inconsistent image sequences, failing to support high-quality algorithm training. Additionally, such methods cannot synthesize multi-modal data essential for perception models. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes an automated system to generate multi-modal perception data (image, point cloud, vehicle status) by synthesizing diverse 3D scenes within a simulation platform. By directly constructing 3D scene models, the system eliminates perspective inconsistencies inherent in rendering-based methods. Experimental validation showing the system generates consistent, high-quality data for autonomous driving.},

  abstract = {Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3x higher throughput and consumes 2.3x less energy. CENT reduces the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2x more tokens per dollar than GPUs.},

Thus, an AI-driven application-level consensus with quality-assured enablers is imperative.We propose Proof-of-INtelligence (PIN), an application-level consensus for AI-based blockchain and federated learning, ensuring AI enabler quality. To the best of our knowledge, PIN pioneers the first AI-centric application-level consensus for distributed environments. Employing enablers like accuracy and training quality, PIN is showcased in the federated learning setup “PIN in BlOckchAin-based fedeRateD learning (PIN-BOARD),” the first AI-specific consensus application in blockchain-based federated learning. Both PIN and PIN-BOARD are the highlights of our contributions to the presented work and emphasize the novelty. PIN is the first AI-centric application-level consensus for blockchain and pioneers decentralized AI assurance; PIN addresses the limitations of existing consensus protocols and advances blockchain-based federated learning through the novel framework called PIN-BOARD. Experimental evaluation involves PIN’s accuracy, confirmation time, and a new AI-assurance factor metric. PIN-BOARD’s assessment includes testing accuracy and reward accuracy. A thorough security analysis ensures the strength of PIN and PIN-BOARD. The comparative evaluation highlights PIN’s 20\% throughput enhancement and efficient artificial index. PIN-BOARD reduces epochs by 28.5\% for peak federated learning accuracy as compared to existing federated models. Thus, PIN emerges as an efficient AI-driven application-level consensus with AI assurance.},

  abstract = {Modern language models (LMs) have been successfully employed in source code generation and understanding, leading to a significant increase in research focused on learning-based code intelligence, such as automated bug repair, and test case generation. Despite their great potential, language models for code intelligence (LM4Code) are susceptible to potential pitfalls, which hinder realistic performance and further impact their reliability and applicability in real-world deployment. Such challenges drive the need for a comprehensive understanding - not just identifying these issues but delving into their possible implications and existing solutions to build more reliable language models tailored to code intelligence. Based on a well-defined systematic research approach, we conducted an extensive literature review to uncover the pitfalls inherent in LM4Code. Finally, 121 primary studies from top-tier venues have been identified. After carefully examining these studies, we designed a taxonomy of pitfalls in LM4Code research and conducted a systematic study to summarize the issues, current solutions, implications, and challenges of different pitfalls for LM4Code systems. We developed a comprehensive classification scheme that dissects pitfalls across four crucial aspects: data collection and labeling, system design and learning, performance evaluation, and deployment and maintenance. Through this study, we aim to provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners, facilitating their understanding and utilization of LM4Code in reliable and trustworthy ways.},

  abstract = {As the scale of agricultural production continues to expand, plant diseases have become a major threat to global agricultural productivity. Although traditional disease detection methods are widely used, they generally suffer from low accuracy and complex operations, making them difficult to meet the needs of modern agriculture. In response to these problems, this article proposes a new deep learning model-LabInt. LabInt uses dual-branch independent convolution in Lab color space, which effectively reduces the impact of illumination changes on feature extraction. Through spatial reconstruction and multi-scale pooling technology, the model can deeply mine shallow disease features and use deep convolution instead of ordinary convolution to reduce computational costs and improve the model's fine-grained identification capabilities. In addition, in order to adapt to complex agricultural environments, LabInt introduces a multi-head self-attention (MHA) mechanism to dynamically enhance attention to disease characteristics and significantly reduce the interference of complex backgrounds. Experimental results show that LabInt exhibits excellent disease recognition performance in actual agricultural production environments, with key indicators such as precision and recall reaching high levels. Ablation studies show that each module makes an important contribution to model performance. Therefore, LabInt is not only innovative in theory, but also shows strong application potential in practice, and is expected to become an important tool to improve the efficiency of agricultural disease prevention and control.},

This unidirectional perspective often overlooks the societal context that may impact mental health. In the context of refugees' mental health, we propose a novel dual-perspective approach by examining both self-reflective tweets expressing emotional distress and hostile tweets from host country citizens. We employ large language models to extract and summarize crucial concerns from vast unstructured user-generated data, using them as input for our agent-based simulations for policy intervention. The proposed simulation-based approach suggests comprehensive policies to address displacement-related trauma and societal hostility faced by refugees in host countries.},

  abstract = {Due to its easy-to-use characteristic, passwords are still the main way to authenticate a person online. However, as the increasing number of websites, users now often come across the issues of password overload. Such repeated use of one's passwords or choosing simple passwords such as names or dates could lead to serious security risks. Password-guessing simulations could effectively prevent these vulnerabilities. Nowadays, most modern websites request passwords with special characters to enhance their complexity. This study emphasizes the special characters within passwords. By using t-SNE visualization and KL divergence, we have analyzed the distribution of these characters among different passwords visually and quantitatively. As the result shows, special characters present a unique distribution mode in t-SNE visualization, with a higher KL divergence value than alphabetic and digit segments. Based on our findings, a password-guessing approach that classified the special character segments into four types according to the position named the Pos-PCFG model has been proposed. The model has improved the guessing accuracy of multiple datasets. In the Rockyou dataset test, accuracy was achieved with a notable 0.98\% increase when guessing passwords consisting of special characters.},

One such tool, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), is rapidly permeating into people's daily lives and is considered to have the potential to reshape our society. While private organizations are spending huge amounts of money on ChatGPT, its usage in the public domain is still driven by its open access and simple functionality. This study draws on the key concepts of Effective Use theory—Transparent Interaction, Representational Fidelity, Informed Action, and Learning and Adaptation—to examine ChatGPT's current state of diffusion in four public sector domains: transportation, healthcare, agriculture, and law. We find that transparent interaction is better in transportation, agriculture, and law than healthcare; representational fidelity presents a complex picture, whereas informed action has been positive across domains; and learning and adaptation is an ongoing need. We conclude with various suggestions related to research and policy toward boosting GenAI's adoption. We suggest that governments invest resources and develop new regulatory frameworks considering the specific context and use cases for leveraging the enormous potential of GenAI tools in the public domain.},

By integrating quantization into the MPC protocols, PPQformer significantly reduces memory footprint and enhances computational performance while preserving data and model privacy.

Modern HPC systems feature data monitoring infrastructures that provide insights into the system's state. This data can be leveraged to train machine learning models to anticipate anomalies that require compute nodes to undergo maintenance procedures. This paper presents a novel approach to predicting such anomalies by creating a graph per measurement that encodes current and past sensor readings and information related to the compute node sensors. The experiments were performed with data collected from Marconi 100, a tier-0 production supercomputer at CINECA in Bologna, Italy.

As an effective model compression technique, model distillation constructs small-scale student models from large models through knowledge transfer, significantly reducing resource requirements. However, there is a risk of information leakage during the distillation process of the model. This article deeply analyzes the potential mechanisms of information leakage in the distillation process of Transformer, including data reproduction attacks, reverse inference attacks, and other issues. In response to the above risks, a method combining differential privacy technology with secure multi-party computation was proposed for protection, and its effectiveness was verified through experiments. Research has shown that this method can significantly reduce the risk of information leakage while ensuring model performance.},

  abstract = {The emergence of generative and procedural art marks a fundamental shift in creative practice, where the traditional “art-object” (painting, sculpture…) transforms into an “art-subject” paradigm that challenges temporal assumptions about design and futurity. As computational systems evolve beyond mere extensions of human memory and processing capacity, they demonstrate a unique form of creativity that can be characterized as “imachination”—a term that captures the machine’s distinctive approach to creative synthesis, which parallels yet diverges from normative human imagination.This transformation necessitates a reconceptualization of artistic skills and creative agency. While traditional artistic mastery centered on manual dexterity and technical craftsmanship (tekhn\`{e} vs tekhn\`{e}), contemporary practice reveals that manual execution may have restricted the creative process to a temporally and spatially contained form or reification. We may consider that, until the 19th century, the art-object has restrained the canonic practice to using hands as a constraint imposed by the inability to directly project mental concepts through the eyes. Assuming with Leonardo that “la pittura\`{e} cosa mentale”, the art-object translates into the interruption, at a highly specific moment of the mental process putting a full stop to its dynamic expression. Temporality becomes a good way to understand the outcomes of generative media. While the traditional practice focusses on the trace left by the brush stroke or the chisel print in marble, the evidence of “what happened” frozen in time (Roland Barthes’ “\c{C}a a\'{e}t\'{e}” (in La chambre claire), reversely, generative and processual artworks are designed for “what they will come”. Metaphorically we could say that one is the hundred millions years old petrified tree, the other is the seed of promises, thoroughly designed by the artist to open up fields of virtuality. The temporal switch is striking and it doesn’t affect only the artwork, but also the artist forced to reconsider one’s practice.The advent of collective (Pierre Levy) and connective (Derrick de Kerckhove) intelligence introduces creativity models based on unlimited repositories of historical references. This creates a fundamental paradox: we expect creativity to forge new pathways while simultaneously grounding it in comprehensive analysis of existing patterns. The limitations of traditional IQ-based assessments of logical-mathematical intelligence become apparent in this context, neurotypical thinking is a highly normative conception of human thought, and neurodivergent thinking patterns—characterized by rapid, non-linear connections across conceptual spaces—may provide more accurate models for understanding how imachination operates.During this talk, I will present original case studies exploring the conceptual territory of human-machine creative interweaving. Through the definition of conceptual building blocks such as iterative curatorship, egonomy, extended serendipity, critical fusion, artificial intentionality, and maieutic engines, this essay shed light on how human creative role will evolve, not competing with artificial intelligence, but through new forms of human-machine symbiosis that expand the boundaries of creative possibilities, while presenting to the human kind a magic mirror to see its true colors.The investigation draws upon the ancient concept of clinamen–the random disruption of the flow of particles that generates diversity in atomic systems–as a metaphor for understanding how creative divergence functions in both human neurodivergence and artificial intelligence systems. By following these “lines of steepest slope” through the latent spaces of machine learning, we can better comprehend the emerging landscape of augmented creativity and its implications for future artistic practice.},

  abstract = {Recently, as one of the most popular covert communication technologies, generative steganography has received ever-increasing attention due to its promising performance against sophisticated steganalysis tools. However, it is quite difficult for the existing generative steganographic approaches to find a good trade-off between hiding capacity and extraction accuracy, mainly due to the small capacity of their hiding spaces. To overcome this shortcoming, a Progressive Generative Steganographic (PGS) network architecture is proposed to hide a secret message during the progressive image generation process to realize secure covert communication. Specifically, we first propose a robust Secret-to-Noise (S2N) mapping method to encode the secret message as a set of noise maps. Then, guided by these noise maps, a set of corresponding images ranging from low resolution to high resolution are progressively generated by the single generative adversarial networks (SINGAN). Consequently, a large-sized secret message can be hidden in the finally generated high-resolution image, since a set of high-capacity hiding spaces can be provided by the process of progressive image generation. Moreover, to improve the quality of image generation and the accuracy of secret message extraction, a Dense Secret-Feature Connection (DSFC) strategy is designed and integrated into the proposed PGS network architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PGS outperforms the existing approaches in the aspects of both hiding capacity and message extraction, while maintaining promising anti-detectability and imperceptibility for covert communication.},

  abstract = {Computing students increasingly rely on generative AI tools for programming assistance, often without formal instruction or guidance. This highlights a need to teach students how to effectively interact with AI models, particularly through natural language prompts, to generate and critically evaluate code for solving computational tasks. To address this, we developed a novel platform for prompt programming that enables authentic dialogue-based interactions, supports problems involving multiple interdependent functions, and offers on-request execution of generated code. Data analysis from over 900 students in an introductory programming course revealed high engagement, with the majority of prompts occurring within multi-turn dialogues. Problems with multiple interdependent functions encouraged iterative refinement, with progression graphs highlighting several common strategies. Students were highly selective about the code they chose to test, suggesting that on-request execution of generated code promoted critical thinking. Given the growing importance of learning dialogue-based programming with AI, we provide this tool as a publicly accessible resource, accompanied by a corpus of programming problems for educational use.},

The rising popularity of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is likely to further consolidate the power of these companies. The rapid expansion of Big Tech in various domains has triggered a wide range of economic, ethical, and political concerns. However, the US Government is also engaged in a growing technology and AI race with China. As a result, the US government now faces the challenges of balancing the external goal of winning the AI race through close collaboration with the Big Tech and the internal objective of regulating the Big Tech. In this article, we argue that this intersection of interest has been the primary motivator of US policy on the governance of Big Tech. By exploring the evolution of AI policy in the US, we highlight the role internal and external pressures have played in its approach to AI governance.},

While GenAI certainly poses threats to time-honored instructional techniques, it also provides opportunities for new forms of instructional support. In this work, we introduce our strategy for configuring an LLM to serve as a ''rubber duck debugging'' coding assistant to help novice programmers when they encounter difficulties in programming assignments. The key contribution of this work is not in the idea of using LLMs for debugging itself (which has already been demonstrated elsewhere, e.g., [3]) but to demonstrate the ease, flexibility, and pedagogical potential of the strategy. In particular, through carefully crafted prompts and easily accessible platforms, rubber duck LLMs can assist learners with specific questions while also situating those questions alongside larger computer science concepts and computational thinking practices. This work contributes an easily replicated and model-agnostic instructional strategy that productively and responsibly leverages the power of LLMs to assist novice programmers in developing foundational programming skills.},

The system represents the relationships between learning contents using knowledge graphs and combines reinforcement learning technology to dynamically optimize learning paths. Experiments indicate that the system surpasses traditional methods in terms of feature extraction accuracy, knowledge mastery, and learning path optimization. Specifically, the feature extraction accuracy is 85.8\%, and the knowledge point coverage reaches 89.7\%. In practical teaching applications, the system enhances students' average learning efficiency by 35\% and increases the knowledge mastery growth rate by 40\%.

However, little consideration is given to how to use these models for real-time or cooperative jamming musical applications because of crucial required features: low latency, the ability to communicate planned actions, and the ability to adapt to user input in real-time. To support these needs, we introduce ReaLJam, an interface and protocol for live musical jamming sessions between a human and a Transformer-based AI agent trained with reinforcement learning. We enable real-time interactions using the concept of anticipation, where the agent continually predicts how the performance will unfold and visually conveys its plan to the user. We conduct a user study where experienced musicians jam in real-time with the agent through ReaLJam. Our results demonstrate that ReaLJam enables enjoyable and musically interesting sessions, and we uncover important takeaways for future work.},

Writing tests were given before and after teaching, and score data were collected and analyzed in terms of several aspects. The test results showed that the experimental group students' writing scores improved significantly with a dense distribution of scores and the number of students scoring high. The improvement in the control group was smaller, with a diffuse distribution and wide fluctuation. Independent sample t-tests also confirmed the effectiveness of the new teaching method.

  abstract = {Biased information (recently termed bisinformation) continues to be taught in medical curricula, often long after having been debunked. In this paper, we introduce Bricc, a first-in-class initiative that seeks to mitigate medical bisinformation using machine learning to systematically identify and flag text with potential biases, for subsequent review in an expert-in-the-loop fashion, thus greatly accelerating an otherwise labor-intensive process. We have developed a goldstandard Bricc dataset throughout several years containing over 12K pages of instructional materials. Medical experts meticulously annotated these documents for bias according to comprehensive coding guidelines, emphasizing gender, sex, age, geography, ethnicity, and race. Using this labeled dataset, we trained, validated, and tested medical bias classifiers. We test three classifier approaches: a binary type-specific classifier, a general bias classifier; an ensemble combining bias type-specific classifiers independently-trained; and a multitask learning (MTL) model tasked with predicting both general and type-specific biases. While MTL led to some improvement on race bias detection in terms of F1-score, it did not outperform binary classifiers trained specifically on each task. On general bias detection, the binary classifier achieves up to 0.923 of AUC, a 27.8\% improvement over the baseline. This work lays the foundations for debiasing medical curricula by exploring a novel dataset and evaluating different training model strategies. Hence, it offers new pathways for more nuanced and effective mitigation of bisinformation.},

  abstract = {The graphic industry faces an ongoing problem: printing defects, which, despite their impact, have not been widely studied. Globally, the demand for commercial printing is expected to grow by 24\%. In Peru, this sector plays a significant role in the economy. According to INEI, it is part of the manufacturing industry, contributing 12.5\% to the national GDP and employing 8.5\% of the Economically Active Population (EAP). Additionally, in 2021, it saw a 7.3\% increase in sales. This study proposes an innovative model to tackle this issue by combining AI-driven digital technologies with industrial engineering tools. Defects affect more than just finances; they also lead to customer loss and damage to a company's reputation. Key causes include poor design procedures, printer malfunctions, failure to follow proper storage practices, and prolonged storage, all of which contribute to defective prints and the use of degraded raw materials. In response, various improvements have been implemented, including method studies, work standardization, planned maintenance, adherence to good storage practices, and the use of Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and Demand Driven Material Requirements Planning (DDMRP). The main contribution of this study is the identification and validation of a model that helps graphic companies overcome challenges in quality and order fulfillment. The model was tested using Arena simulation software and implemented in a Peruvian company specializing in commercial printing. The results showed a 12.03\% decrease in defect rates (from 17.59\% to 5.56\%), an increase in the&nbsp;meantime between failures by 400.7 hours (from 46.35 to 447.05 hours), and a reduction in defective raw materials from 23.81\% to 11.11\%. Additionally, the capacity of the printing and storage processes has been optimized.

  abstract = {The increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) will likely lead to new interactions and impacts for the general public. An understanding of people's perceptions of AI can be leveraged to design and deploy AI systems toward human needs and values. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 individuals in the general public and 20 AI experts in the United States (U.S.) to assess perceptions of AI across levels of expertise. Qualitative analysis revealed that ideas about humanness and ethics were central to perceptions of AI in both groups. Humanness, the set of traits considered to distinguish humans from other intelligent actors, was used to articulate beliefs about AI's characteristics. Ethics arose in discussions of the role of technology in society and centered around views of AI as made and used by people. General public and expert participants expressed similar perceptions of AI, but articulated beliefs slightly differently. We discuss the implications of humanness-related beliefs and ethical concerns for AI development and deployment.},

  abstract = {Responsible prompt engineering has emerged as a critical pracitce for ensuring that generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are aligned with ethical, legal, and social principles. As generative AI applications become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, the way we instruct and interact with them through prompts has profound implications for fairness, accountability, and transparency. It is, therefore, necessary to examine how strategic prompt engineering can embed ethical and legal considerations and societal values directly into AI interactions, moving beyond mere technical optimization for functionality. This article proposes “Reflexive Prompt Engineering”, a comprehensive framework for responsible prompt engineering that encompasses five interconnected components: prompt design, system selection, system configuration, performance evaluation, and prompt management. Drawing from empirical evidence, the paper demonstrates how each component can be leveraged to promote improved societal outcomes while mitigating potential risks. The analysis reveals that effective prompt engineering requires a delicate balance between technical precision and ethical consciousness, combining the systematic rigor and focus on functionality with the nuanced understanding of social impact. Through examination of emerging practices, this article illustrates how responsible prompt engineering serves as a crucial connection between AI development and deployment, enabling organizations to align AI outputs without modifying underlying model architectures. This approach links with broader “Responsibility by Design” principles, embedding ethical considerations directly into the implementation process rather than treating them as post-hoc additions. The article concludes by identifying key research directions and practical guidelines for advancing the field of responsible prompt engineering as an essential component of AI literacy.},

It discusses the potential applications, problems, and challenges of it in product design and prospects for the future. Based on this, through the research, a conclusion has been drawn that the research of Generative AI is in its infancy in the field of product design. Generative AI is very advantageous in shortening the design cycle, improving design efficiency, and saving time and cost. At the same time, it also has certain application potential for designers in designing, product development, and enhancing user experience. However, there are many challenges that must also be faced, including technical limitations, ethical dilemmas, and legal problems. Therefore, how to properly cope with the current challenges and effectively integrate Generative AI into the existing design process has become an important issue at present.},

  abstract = {In today's era, artificial intelligence technology is developing rapidly. Under such a background, translation quality evaluation system relying on deep learning has gradually become a hot research topic in the field of translation research. Traditional manual evaluation methods have their own shortcomings, which are relatively subjective and low evaluation efficiency. The existing automatic assessment indicators such as BLEU and METEOR, which have deficiencies in cultural adaptability and logical coherence, cannot meet the complex needs of Sino-French alternating interpretation. This evaluation system combines multi-modal analysis with cross-language and cultural feature database. Based on the improvement of Transformer model architecture, a hierarchical evaluation mechanism is designed, which significantly improves the objectivity of evaluation and makes the evaluation more comprehensive. The experimental results show that this system has more advantages than the traditional method in the three core indicators of accuracy, fluency and cultural adaptability. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the score of this system and the human score reaches 0.87, which proves that it is effective in cross-language and cultural adaptation scenarios. This study provides an extensible technical framework for the assessment of translation quality, and provides innovative solutions to the challenges of linguistic structural differences and cultural metaphor translation.},

This approach solves the complex access control challenges arising from data sharing and large number of users in power grid regulation systems. First, the Aprior algorithm is used to mine strong association rules from the user authority relationship to reveal the potential relationship between resources. Then, the user rights relationship is enhanced, resource similarity is calculated, and collaborative filtering is used to generate recommended values for unauthorized resources. Finally, the access control policy is classified and authorized according to the recommended value, and the automatic generation of the policy is realized. The experimental results show that this method can not only generate access control policies automatically, but also assign new permissions effectively and ensure the privacy of resource data.},

With the rapid development of information technology, traditional university courses have gradually shown certain shortcomings in content presentation and teaching interaction. Existing studies use more algorithms such as machine learning to improve classroom efficiency and students' learning experience. To this end, we proposed a set of digital transformation strategies for university courses and verified them through empirical research. The study selected two university courses, “Advanced Mathematics” and “Crawler Technology”, and adopted the integration model of “technology-assisted + traditional teaching” to carry out teaching reform. The purpose is to explore the specific situation of new tools in enriching course content, expanding knowledge coverage, improving learning outcomes, improving student satisfaction, and stimulating online learning activity. We also introduced relevant technologies such as natural language processing and data mining to construct a quantitative evaluation index system. By setting up an experimental group and a control group, a comparative analysis was conducted through data such as students' academic performance, platform usage records, and course feedback. The results show that the course content has become more layered after integrating new technologies, and students' learning performance has improved significantly, with satisfaction increasing from 70\% to 91\%, academic performance improving by an average of about 15\%, and online learning participation increasing by 20\%. These data verify the positive role of intelligent means in course optimization from multiple dimensions.},

This study explores the behavioral characteristics and text generation quality of college students when using generative AI tools, and proposes an integrated research framework that combines natural language processing (NLP), cluster analysis, and regression models. This study uses 200 students from a university in Guangdong as the research dataset, uses the BERT model to quantify the fluency, relevance, and creativity of generated texts, and uses the K-means algorithm to classify students' behaviors into three categories: high-frequency learners, low-frequency casual users, and mixed users. The experimental results show that the text quality under different task types is significantly different. For example, the scenarios of writing summary generation and creative writing are different. The summary generation task has the highest score in relevance (90 points), while the creative writing task performs well in creativity (85 points). Subsequent regression analysis found that professional background and technical attitude are key factors affecting behavioral patterns. Students of science and engineering tend to frequently use generative AI tools for complex tasks, while students of humanities pay more attention to language fluency and creativity.},

Insurers who want to secure the highest customer satisfaction level and service quality can no longer ignore the necessity of personal intelligent customer service.

This paper presents a technique for developing personalized dialogue in intelligent customer service applications to the insurance business. Our model establishes an insurance knowledge base and utilizes the retrieval-augmented generation approach. In addition, we create dynamic memory by connecting the long short-term memory module, allowing the system to retrieve and modify customer's information while interacting with them in real time. As a result, intelligent models offer much more natural and engaging conversations, adjusting to specific tones and retaining individual emotions. These virtual assistants customize the responses according to the customer profiles. Hence, they give appropriate, professional, and personalized insurance advice.},

In order to solve these difficulties, we provide in this work a fresh plan formulation strategy using multimodal fusion techniques and cross-modal learning. The model develops a customized training schedule using the powerful NLP capacity of LLMs by bridging several kinds of data (the physiological signals, motion trajectories, and text input) into a single structure.

Results of this study highlight the revolutionary relevance of AI-based best running practices that can help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of track and field training approaches.},

  abstract = {The development of artificial intelligence (AI) in the beauty industry can reshape the way consumers interact with businesses, enabling them to quickly select more suitable products and providing a more convenient, targeted, and safer comfortable experience. Cosmetics companies integrate AI technology with offline shopping models, not only enhancing customer engagement and novelty in the store but also allowing businesses to identify products that customers prefer and target. South Korea is the first country in the world to enact laws and policies related to the customized cosmetics industry. South Korea's use of AI technology to develop customized cosmetics has been widely noticed in the international beauty market. The AI technology-based customized cosmetics industry in South Korea is mainly composed of three major industries: cosmetic products (skin care, makeup, beauty and hair care, and related products), beauty devices, and software services. In 2015, after Amorepacific Group first developed customized cosmetics in South Korea, companies such as LG Household \&amp; Health Care Ltd, CJ On Style, and H&amp;B began to engage in research and development in the customized cosmetics industry, achieving good results in both technology and product development. This study collects and investigates the development strategies of South Korean customized cosmetics companies and analyzes and organizes the methods of use and production principles of related products. It is hoped to provide some reference value for the development strategies and product research and development of global AI customized cosmetics companies.},

  abstract = {In an era where digital technology is reshaping human-computer interaction, this research investigates the constraints associated with users assuming passive roles in conventional characters. To address this issue, a "User-Involved Real-Time Interactive System for Digital Humans" has been developed. The system integrates multimodal data acquisition devices—such as thermal sensors, visual cameras, and heart rate trackers—with advanced generative artificial intelligence models. By processing user-specific physiological characteristics and behavioral tendencies, the system dynamically generates personalized virtual entities. This approach empowers individuals from mere recipients of digital content to active participants in its creation. Furthermore, leveraging the TouchDesigner platform, the system constructs mixed-reality settings. Through the integration of sensor-based hardware and ComfyUI processing pipelines, it ensures immediate synchronization between users' real-time inputs and the generation of corresponding virtual characters. Experimental results demonstrate that the system enhances user immersion, engagement, and emotional satisfaction through visual editing, driving the evolution from static identity models to real-time dynamic systems and offering novel pathways for technological value conversion.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, its application in the field of language culture and visual presentation has attracted widespread attention. As an important part of China's regional culture, the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing have unique phonetic, lexical and grammatical characteristics. However, with the advancement of modernization, the inheritance and revitalization of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing face many challenges. This paper takes the visual transformation of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing as the research object, and explores how to integrate artificial intelligence technology into the workshop design strategy with the visual transformation of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing as the research object, so as to achieve the symbolic translation and multi-dimensional visualization presentation of the dialects. The study first extracted the representative vocabulary of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing and analyzed their visual transformation needs. Combining the advantages of artificial intelligence technology, the action research method was used to establish a workshop based on a multimodal transformation framework such as speech recognition and image generation. Through case analysis and practical verification, this paper demonstrates the application effect of artificial intelligence technology in the dialect visual transformation workshop, including the visualization of dialect words, the visualization of dialect stories, and the interactive experience of dialect culture. The research conclusion is: the icons generated by generative artificial intelligence integrated into the visual transformation of dialects can be seen to have more concrete symbols and fewer symbolic symbols. These will gradually change as the participants are "tamed" by artificial intelligence. In the graphic symbols generated by combining symbols, we can find two types of combination: international symbols and regional symbols. This provides an experimental paradigm for the design with dialect as the carrier, and also provides a reference for the discussion of the spread and regeneration of dialect.},

  abstract = {In the contemporary flourishing digital economy, advancements in artificial intelligence are incessantly reconfiguring the capital market landscape. This study commences with the industry perturbation instigated by the DeepSeek large - model to explore the interactive mechanisms between financial public opinion and capital markets during technological innovation events. Through the comprehensive utilization of methods such as literature review, case analysis, social network analysis, and regression analysis, and drawing on 12,329 Weibo public opinion data points and high - frequency trading data from 16 A - share DeepSeek concept stocks, a novel “technology decoding – market response” dual - path model is constructed. The study reveals that technology - related public opinion gradually infiltrates the financial domain via a three - stage progression: “professional decoding – industry restructuring – investment decision - making.” Technology bloggers assume a pivotal role in information dissemination, as evidenced by an intermediary centrality of 0.29. The data further indicate that for each one - standard - deviation increment in public opinion intensity, the excess return of concept stocks surges by 1.8\% after 36 hours (p = 0.03), whereas the impact of sentiment polarity on stock prices is not statistically significant (β = 0.04, p = 0.41).Adopting an integrated perspective from journalism and behavioral finance, this research elucidates the propagation patterns of technology - related public opinion and its inherent connections with capital markets, and it formulates a “technology–finance” public opinion governance framework. These findings provide crucial theoretical underpinnings and practical guidelines for the prevention of financial risks associated with technology - related public opinion, thereby having far - reaching implications for optimizing financial market regulation and enhancing public opinion management systems.},

In order to explore how to improve undergraduate students' ability to cope with information security threats brought about by generative artificial intelligence, this paper constructs a theoretical model for improving undergraduate students' information security behaviour in the context of generative artificial intelligence by integrating the theory of protective motivation, the theory of planned behaviour, and the theory of social cognition. Based on 354 questionnaire survey data, this study systematically analyses the influencing factors and mechanisms of undergraduate students' information security in the context of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that perceived threat, subjective norms and self-efficacy have a positive influence on students' information security behaviour intention, which in turn has a positive influence on their information security behaviour implementation, with environmental support playing a moderating role between the two. The findings of the study help to further improve the theoretical model of undergraduate students' information security behaviour in the context of artificial intelligence, and at the same time provide valuable insights for education departments and colleges and universities to take effective measures to improve undergraduate students' information security capabilities in the era of generating artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {This paper takes the group standards of China's artificial intelligence-related industries as the research object and analyzes the characteristics of participating drafting units and group standard organizations in the group standard cooperation network based on the structural characteristics such as centrality and network density obtained from social network analysis. The study finds that although the development time of group standards in China's artificial intelligence-related industries is short, the development is rapid, and the cooperation network has basically taken shape. The central positions of some group standard organizations and participating drafting units have been initially formed. However, it can also be seen that some group standard organizations, despite having a close relationship with participating drafting units, have not yet established connections with the overall network, indicating that the overall cooperation network is still loose, and only some group standard organizations play relatively key roles in constructing the network for the formulation of group standards in the artificial intelligence-related industries. In the process of promoting the maturity of the cooperation network of group standards in artificial intelligence-related industries, there are still many challenges and room for optimization. On the one hand, it is urgent to take effective measures to strengthen the connections among all entities within the network, reduce the looseness of the network, and improve the overall collaborative efficiency, such as establishing an information sharing platform. On the other hand, group standard organizations and participating drafting units in central positions should give full play to their leading and exemplary roles, and drive the common development of other entities within the network through means such as technical assistance and experience sharing. In addition, the government and industry associations should also play an active role by introducing targeted policies and regulations to guide the formulation and implementation of group standards for artificial intelligence, urging all parties involved to strengthen cooperation and build a more complete standard system. Looking ahead, with the continuous deepening of collaborative governance by all parties, the cooperation network of group standards in the artificial intelligence industry will continue to be optimized and upgraded. It will not only promote the high-quality development of China's artificial intelligence industry but also demonstrate China's wisdom in the field of global artificial intelligence standard setting and enhance China's international discourse power and influence in this field.},

  abstract = {Objective:&nbsp;To address the loneliness of nearly 80-million Empty Nest Youth in China, this study proposes an optimized solution integrating the KONA model and IoT technology. The approach adopts a "technology-emotion dual-driven" strategy to enhance the home experience of contemporary youth living alone. Method:&nbsp;A four-layer IoT architecture (perception layer, network layer, cognitive layer, execution layer) and dynamic algorithms were constructed. Key demand factors (Emotional interaction SI, Nostalgic elements DSI) were extracted using the KANO model and factor analysis. Two product prototypes were designed: a radio/MP3-inspired desk lamp and a wall lamp. Performance was validated through the NASA-TLX scale and nearly 300 questionnaires. Results:&nbsp;System response latency was reduced, energy consumption decreased by approximately 1/3, Satisfaction with emotional interaction increased significantly. Cognitive load decreased, and emotional interaction satisfaction increased. However, nostalgic elements and durability require further improvement. Optimization strategies based on an importance-satisfaction matrix were proposed to provide home design products with both high efficiency and emotional support for Empty Nest Youth, In order to promote the deep integration of human-computer interaction.},

The purpose of this study is to explore the interaction model between teachers and normal university students in primary and secondary schools based on artificial intelligence, build a two-way empowerment model, and emphasize the mutual promotion and common growth of teachers and normal university students in the training process. This study clearly puts forward the importance of teachers' deep participation in the training of normal university students and constructs a theoretical framework of teacher education oriented to practice. Deep participation means that teachers actively, continuously and comprehensively participate in the training process of normal university students through teaching design, practical guidance and feedback evaluation. Based on the above framework, this study takes the students majoring in education in Sichuan Normal University as the research object, and conducts a comparative experiment to verify the application effect of artificial intelligence under the framework of two-way empowerment. In addition, in view of the challenges faced, this study also puts forward suggestions on path optimization, so that teachers and students can grow together with the support of artificial intelligence, that is, both sides can jointly improve educational concepts, teaching methods and professional quality, thus promoting the continuous progress of education.},

  abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents about 85\% of total lung cancer cases. The main curative treatment for locally advanced patients who cannot undergo surgery relies on radiotherapy but target delineation using traditional CT faces challenges related to physician skill and lacks adequate predictive dimensions for treatment outcomes. The integration of artificial intelligence technologies with multimodal imaging has become more common to enhance both target delineation precision and treatment effectiveness prediction. The functional imaging capabilities of PET/CT and MRI help doctors evaluate suspicious metastatic lymph nodes and separate tumors from atelectasis or inflammation through metabolic and microstructural information. Deep learning algorithms enable radiomics models to extract image-based high-dimensional features which predict local control rates and survival outcomes and other clinical results. The current implementation of AI-assisted multimodal imaging in NSCLC radiotherapy faces multiple challenges including non-standardized data and inadequate model interpretability and insufficient clinical workflow integration. Further radiomics and multi-omics research needs urgent attention especially when radiotherapy combines with immunotherapy or targeted therapy. The future development requires three main steps: enhancing large-scale multicenter data sharing for external validation and developing interpretable AI algorithms and individualized adaptive radiotherapy strategies while promoting standardized clinical AI-assisted multimodal imaging applications to achieve precise and efficient NSCLC radiotherapy.},

The review study narrates research on AI-driven approaches: machine learning, deep learning, federated learning, and generative algorithms (GAs) for fault diagnosis. Internet of Things (IoT) enabled real-time monitoring and intelligence maintenance techniques. Recurrent neural networks particularly long short-term memory (LSTM) models and ML techniques analyse the sensor data for prediction of stress, wear, and failure modes of components, achieving high accuracy and enabling proactive interventions. The results reveal that IoT networks coupled with AI approaches continuously monitor critical parameters including vibration and temperature. This study reveals that optimization techniques, genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization play significant roles in enhancing the structural design of components like gears and connecting rods that achieve weight reductions without compromising safety. This study identifies challenges of model interpretability, data scarcity, and regulatory compliance. These issues are addressed by proposing hybrid AI models and federated learning. Emerging trends include self-healing materials, quantum ML approaches, and automated maintenance systems, which could transform safety in the aviation industry. By bridging research gaps between engineering practices and data-driven insights, this study shows that AI can play a vital role in advancing the efficiency and reliability of drive mechanisms in next-generation aircraft, compliance with aviation protocols, and paving the way for adaptive and autonomous systems.},

However, generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) brings additional design considerations and currently lacks sufficient user guidance regarding affordances, inputs, and outputs. In this context, we developed a recommender system to promote responsible AI (RAI) practices while people prompt GenAI systems. We detail 10 interviews with IT professionals, the resulting recommender system developed, and 20 user sessions with IT professionals interacting with our prompt recommendations. Results indicate that responsible prompting recommendations have the potential to support novice prompt engineers and raise awareness about RAI in prompting-time. They also suggest that recommendations should simultaneously maximize both a prompt’s similarity to a user’s input as well as a diversity of associated social values provided. These findings contribute to RAI by offering practical ways to provide user guidance and enrich human-GenAI interaction via prompt recommendations.},

We propose an unstructured design paradigm that combines algorithmic aesthetics with cultural gene encoding, aiming to break the paradox of algorithmic optimization and cultural adaptation in the era of artificial intelligence and reconstruct the methodology of human-machine collaborative design. The study shows that the paradigm can establish a cognitive framework for designers to collaborate with AI and help transform design thinking and construct new design relationships.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence are driving a significant transformation in information retrieval and content generation, creating substantial opportunities for online advertising. Text-to-image generation technology has become increasingly prevalent in advertising content production, demonstrating promising performance improvements in terms of semantic relevance and visual appeal. However, existing models often suffer from inadequate representation of entity concepts, such as prominent product brands and recognizable landmarks. This inherent limitation subsequently leads to notable deficiencies in brand tonality, industry-specific relevance, and market adaptability of the generated advertising content. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal ad content generation framework specifically engineered for online advertising system, particularly focused on resolving the deficiency in entity concepts. Our framework is comprised of two phases: first, an image captioning module with entity-aware learning based on multimodal large language model, leveraging retrieval-augmented techniques to incorporate entity concepts into image descriptions; second, a text-to-image diffusion model refined on image-text pairs enriched with entity concepts to facilitate entity-grounded image generation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance in both image captioning and image generation compared to existing methods, particularly in the accuracy of depiction of relevant entities in advertising images. Moreover, the deployment of the framework in the system primary traffic of Baidu Search Ads, has brought significant enhancements to advertisement revenue for both advertisers and the platform.},

  abstract = {The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) represents a paradigm shift in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. This change revolutionizes how buildings are designed, constructed, and managed throughout their lifecycle. Using secondary data, this research aims to evaluate the current advances in the role of AI in BIM, emphasizing leveraging AI to improve organizational performance, decision-making, and project delivery. Based on the four classifications of AI systems which are Reactive AI, Limited Memory AI, Theory of Mind AI, and Self-Aware AI, this study analyzed the prospects of BIM applications. Results show that AI in BIM applications offers capabilities across domains such as generative design, predictive maintenance, energy optimization, automated code compliance, clash detection, construction simulation, sustainability analysis, project risk assessment, facility management, and natural language processing. The research also presents major issues arising from the integration of AI in a BIM setting, including Interoperability problems, Data management problems, and Technological resistance problems. Based on the evaluation of the current status and challenges associated with AI integration, this work expects to offer practical recommendations for the stakeholders interested in implementing AI technologies within their BIM projects. In addition, the research reveals new directions in integrating AI into BIM, including digital twins and generative design that will likely transform the project lifecycle. This research fills the gap in the current literature by exploring the AI limitations and opportunities in BIM environments and thereby provides insights into the application of these technologies to enhance innovation and sustainability in construction. Finally, this research provides a basis for new and more rational approaches to construction that would meet the needs of contemporary society.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have infiltrated most aspects of our lives and the technologies we use, including social media. Content (and moderation thereof) on many popular social media platforms is currently a mix of human- and AI-generated. Depending on many technical, situational, and contextual factors, both human- and AI-generated content on social media platforms have the potential to either fuel or fight the stigmatization of marginalized groups. Stigmatization is the social process of stereotyping, devaluing, or marginalizing individuals or groups based on certain characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, religion, or race, which can lead to social exclusion and psychological damage. The impact of AI agents on either reinforcing or reducing existing stigmatization on social media platforms remains largely unknown within our scholarly community. We have even less understanding of how to design and implement AI agents that can actively help transform social media platforms into spaces for combating stigmatization while empowering marginalized groups. In this editorial, we call on the information systems (IS) community to conduct empirical, design, and theoretical research at the intersection of social media, specific AI systems or agents, and marginalized contexts. Advancing research in this space is critical to understanding and shaping the future of social media platforms as a social good and as places to reduce stigmatization.},

  abstract = {Wisdom education in the era of digital intelligence emphasizes the use of intelligent technology to empower education. It can integrate data wisdom, educational wisdom, and cultural wisdom to achieve the precision, creation, and optimization of education, and cultivate learners' wisdom literacy. Due to the potential problems in algorithm, calculation data, and computing power and other aspects of problems in intelligent technology, as well as due to human-related factors such as emotional barriers and management's losing control, wisdom education in the era of digital intelligence faces many risks. This paper applies the methods of philosophical speculation, ethical analysis, emotional analysis, and teaching pathology analysis to study the four major risks in them. (alienation of educational nature, human-machine ethical anomie, lack of artificial emotion, and pathological teaching), and intending to find the resolutions of the corresponding risks in wisdom education. The supposed resolutions are empowering the human-like nature of educational artificial intelligence and combining it with moral education to obtain a complete educaitonal nature of wisdom education; strengthening the governance of human-machine ethics from the source of risk (participants) through the utilization of intelligent educational ethical norms; combining human emotions with artificial emotions to establish a soul that is inclined to goodness of intelligent education; inhibiting pathogenic factors and enhancing disease resistance factors treat teaching diseases and prevent effectively through various therapies.},

For this, our setup consists of a small robotic arm that is connected to a computer to press and release the keys on an electric piano. The computer sends the controlling signals to the robot based on an artificial intelligence-based computer vision pipeline. The potential elements in the different stages of the pipeline were compared to each other in terms of accuracy, efficiency and model parameters, and were chosen accordingly. Our pipeline consists of models for three main functionalities: hand keypoint detection (MediaPipe); static hand signal recognition (a custom MLP model); and dynamic gesture recognition (a GRU model with semantic fusion). This way, our application can recognize the seven hand signals that are based on Kod\'{a}ly’s work, and with the forth and back movement understand the intent of key-press and release of a music note. The system presented high accuracy in the recognition of the hand signals and also the gestures, thus enabling fluent usage in music education.},

We show that robustness and cybersecurity demand resilience against performance disruptions.

Our analysis informs efforts to develop harmonized standards, guidelines by the European Commission, as well as benchmarks and measurement methodologies under Art.&nbsp;15(2)&nbsp;AIA. With this, we seek to bridge the gap between legal terminology and ML research, fostering a better alignment between research and implementation efforts.},

They then used a tangible educational tool: a corkboard with push pins and images to build tactile AI models based on their farm data. Throughout this process, they discussed their hopes and desires regarding AI in farming, and their concerns about AI technologies. The perspectives of the urban farmers reveal their preference for AI systems that are contextual, integrate community values, Indigenous knowledge, and environmental concerns, and are rooted in community ownership of data.

In this paper we discuss our experiences in developing and using a scientific research application using an automated multi-facility workflow that orchestrates data collection, preprocessing, artificial intelligence (AI) inferencing, and data movement across diverse computational resources, leveraging the Advanced Computing Ecosystem Testbed at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF). We demonstrate that our workflow can be seamlessly integrated and orchestrated across research facilities managed by different federal agencies, thus allowing users to extract new scientific insights from climate datasets. The experimental results indicate that the multi-facility workflow significantly reduces processing time, enhances scalability, and maintains high efficiency across varying workloads. Notably, our workflow processes 12,000 high-resolution satellite images in just 44 seconds using 80 workers distributed across 10 nodes on the OLCF systems. Such high throughput is essential for dynamic tokenization and sharding of petascale satellite data for distributed AI model training and inferencing at scale across thousands of GPUs.},

  abstract = {Large-scale recommendation systems are pivotal to process an immense volume of daily user interactions, requiring the effective modeling of high cardinality and heterogeneous features to ensure accurate predictions. In prior work, we introduced Hierarchical Sequential Transducers (HSTU), an attention-based architecture for modeling high cardinality, non-stationary streaming recommendation data, providing good scaling law in the generative recommender framework (GR). Recent studies and experiments demonstrate that attending to longer user history sequences yields significant metric improvements. However, scaling sequence length is activation-heavy, necessitating parallelism solutions to effectively shard activation memory. In transformer-based LLMs, context parallelism (CP) is a commonly used technique that distributes computation along the sequence-length dimension across multiple GPUs, effectively reducing memory usage from attention activations. In contrast, production ranking models typically utilize jagged input tensors to represent user interaction features, introducing unique CP implementation challenges. In this work, we introduce context parallelism with jagged tensor support for HSTU attention, establishing foundational capabilities for scaling up sequence dimensions. Our approach enables a 5.3\texttimes{} increase in supported user interaction sequence length, while achieving a 1.55\texttimes{} scaling factor when combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).},

  abstract = {Generative Retrieval introduces a new approach to Information Retrieval by reframing it as a constrained generation task, leveraging recent advancements in Autoregressive (AR) language models. However, AR-based Generative Retrieval methods suffer from high inference latency and cost compared to traditional dense retrieval techniques, limiting their practical applicability. This paper investigates fully Non-autoregressive (NAR) language models as a more efficient alternative for generative retrieval. While standard NAR models alleviate latency and cost concerns, they exhibit a significant drop in retrieval performance (compared to AR models) due to their inability to capture dependencies between target tokens. To address this, we question the conventional choice of limiting the target token space to solely words or sub-words. We propose PIXNAR, a novel approach that expands the target vocabulary of NAR models to include multi-word entities and common phrases (up to 5 million tokens), thereby reducing token dependencies. PIXNAR employs inference optimization strategies to maintain low inference latency despite the significantly larger vocabulary. Our results demonstrate that PIXNAR achieves a relative improvement of 31.0\% in MRR@10 on MS MARCO and 23.2\% in Hits@5 on Natural Questions compared to standard NAR models with similar latency and cost. Furthermore, online A/B experiments on a large commercial search engine show significant increase in clicks and revenue.},

  abstract = {Conversational recommendation systems (CRSs) use multi-turn interaction to capture user preferences and provide personalized recommendations. A fundamental challenge in CRSs lies in effectively understanding user preferences from conversations. Previous research primarily focuses on the issue of insufficient contextual information in conversations. They address this by introducing external knowledge sources, such as knowledge graphs, large language models (LLMs), and conversational recommendation corpora. Based on this, they design specific alignment strategies (e.g., prompt learning and instruction tuning) to integrate such knowledge for user preference understanding and item recommendation. However, user preferences can be multifaceted and complex, posing significant challenges for accurate recommendations even with access to abundant external knowledge. While interaction with users can clarify their true preferences, frequent user involvement may lead to a degraded user experience.To address this problem, we propose a Generative Reward model based Simulated User, named GRSU, for automatic interaction with CRSs. The simulated user provides feedback to the items recommended by CRSs, enabling them to better capture intricate user preferences through multi-turn interaction. Inspired by generative reward models, we design two types of feedback actions for the simulated user: i.e., generative item scoring, which offers coarse-grained feedback, and attribute-based item critiquing, which provides fine-grained feedback. To ensure seamless integration, these feedback actions are unified into an instruction-based format, allowing the development of a unified simulated user via instruction tuning on synthesized data. With this simulated user, automatic multi-turn interaction with CRSs can be effectively conducted. Furthermore, to strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency, we draw inspiration from the paradigm of reward-guided search in complex reasoning tasks and employ beam search for the interaction process. On top of this, we propose an efficient candidate ranking method to improve the recommendation results derived from interaction. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and transferability of our approach.},

  abstract = {As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) becomes an increasingly significant part of young people’s lives, educators worry about its impact on learning and attainment. However, understanding this impact requires more than simply studying young people’s behaviours or soliciting their opinions. It is essential to involve them actively as co-researchers, allowing their unique perspectives to shape the conversation around GenAI in schools. This project moves beyond seeing young people as research subjects, positioning them instead as co-designers, co-researchers, and potential influencers of national policy on GenAI in education. We recruited eight young people (aged 16–18) from three Scottish high schools to serve as Young People Co-Researchers (YPCR). Together, we explored their perspectives on GenAI at school, including their current usage, views on appropriate tasks for AI, and opinions on teachers’ use of AI. The YPCR organised and conducted semi-structured focus groups with 50 peers and collaboratively analysed the findings with adult researchers. Our results show that young people are cautiously optimistic about GenAI’s potential for learning and do not support outright bans in schools. They clearly distinguish between AI use for learning and in assessments, often expressing confusion over current policies and wishing for clearer guidance. The YPCR stated a strong desire to deepen their understanding of AI’s advantages and risks and for schools to teach responsible, effective use. Their insights are valuable for national policy development and for AI literacy initiatives.},

Additionally, it addresses the challenges of detail recovery and artifact reduction in existing GAN-based approaches under complex scenarios. SemiBiGAN enhances feature representation and global consistency through a semi-cyclic, three-branch architecture and a Dynamic Feature Generation (DFG) block, which together improve the restoration quality of high-resolution (HR) images. The network comprises a synthetic degradation branch, a shared restoration branch, and a real-world degradation branch. The integration of the Bi-Level Routing Attention (BRA) module enables dynamic capture of region- and pixel-level features, significantly enhancing the performance of face super-resolution. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemiBiGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of face structure/detail restoration and quantitative metrics for real-world face super-resolution.},

Our approach learns diverse agent embeddings to capture varying user behaviors and employs a multi-layer perceptron for user-content ranking. We compare three strategies-(1) a generative modeling approach that integrates agent embeddings and collaborative filtering, (2) an LLM-based method grounded in historical context, and (3) a reflection-based clustering technique-and evaluate them on metrics such as comment volume, tree depth, user engagement patterns, and topic distribution. Results show that generative embeddings coupled with collaborative filtering better approximate complex phenomena like localized influencers, specialized subcommunities, and emergent echo chambers. Moreover, our framework supports policy-driven experimentation by incorporating social regularizers (cohesion, polarization, and bias) to simulate scenarios ranging from tightly knit communities to more balanced, cross-cutting interactions. By integrating large-scale data with adaptable LLM-driven agents, this work provides a versatile, data-centric foundation for simulating and analyzing online social ecosystems at scale.},

However, it has been limited to 2D mediums, making it difficult to represent 3D information, particularly for terrains with elevation changes. We present Sketch2Terrain, an intuitive generative-3D-sketch-mapping system combining freehand sketching with generative Artificial Intelligence that radically changes sketch map creation and representation using Augmented Reality. Sketch2Terrain empowers non-experts to create unambiguous sketch maps of natural environments and provides a homogeneous interface for researchers to collect data and conduct experiments. A between-subject study (N=36) revealed that generative-3D-sketch-mapping improved efficiency by 38.4\%, terrain-topology accuracy by 12.5\%, and landmark accuracy by up to 12.1\%, with only a 4.7\% trade-off in terrain-elevation accuracy compared to freehand 3D-sketch-mapping. Additionally, generative-3D-sketch-mapping reduced perceived strain by 60.5\% and stress by 39.5\% over 2D-sketch-mapping. These findings underscore potential applications of generative-3D-sketch-mapping for in-depth understanding and accurate representation of vertically complex environments. The implementation is publicly available.},

However, most generative AI tools rely on text-based prompting, requiring users to translate visual ideas into linguistic descriptions. This approach is misaligned with the sketch-driven workflows of creative professionals. To address this gap, we introduce SketchAI, a novel sketch-first interface for diffusion models that allows practitioners to use real-time sketching on a tablet computer to guide model outputs. Through a qualitative study with 29 fashion design apprentices, we explored the interface’s potential impacts on creative workflows. While some participants identified use cases where SketchAI streamlined routine tasks, others expressed concerns about its potential to undermine creative agency and exploration. These findings unearthed hidden complexity: while generative AI can support some aspects of creativity, its core capabilities may challenge the central identity of creative practitioners. While SketchAI does not resolve this problem, it does take a meaningful step towards reconciliation.},

  abstract = {The automatic spindle detection algorithm based on deep learning technology requires high consistency of sleep spindle annotation, which crowdsourcing can significantly enhance through collective intelligence. To best of our knowledge, few studies have explored auto detection of sleep spindles based on crowdsourced datasets. MODA is the only crowdsourcing spindle annotation open access dataset until now, and this study utilized the MODA dataset to further enhance the automatic detection of sleep spindles using conventional neural network (CNN) and innovative label optimization module. To evaluate our model, we proposed and conducted two analysis methods including analysis by sample-event and by subject. Meanwhile, to validate our performance of our model, SUMO and EXP were considered as control and gold standard methods respectively; and various metrics related to by sample-event and by subject were compared among our model, SUMO and EXP. The results from analysis by sample-event showed that F1 score, Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and Cohen's Kappa coefficient in our model were significantly higher than in SUMO under all overlap thresholds. Specifically, under a higher threshold of 0.6, F1, MCC and Kappa reached 0.82, 0.81, 0.81 in our model, 0.75, 0.74, 0.74 in SUMO, respectively. For analysis by subject, all spindle features extraction of our model were comparable to the EXP, including density (4.48 in our model vs 3.80 in EXP), duration (0.79 vs 0.84), amplitude (29.91 vs 30.09) and frequency (13.04 vs 12.92). However, the spindle density extracted by SUMO was significantly different from EXP (9.04 in SUMO vs 3.80 in EXP). In conclusion, our results suggested that the crowdsourced public dataset and label optimization module can further enhance the spindle detection capability of the convolutional neural network.},

  abstract = {With the increasing integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into cultural heritage dissemination, users' digital interactions in museums have evolved from passive information reception to active co-creation. To investigate the mechanisms through which GenAI usability influences user enjoyment, this study applies the Hedonic Motivation System Adoption Model (HMSAM) and develops a theoretical framework incorporating six mediating constructs: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, curiosity, joy, sense of control, and immersion. Based on 582 valid responses collected from the “Cloud Tour of Dunhuang” digital heritage initiative, structural equation modeling was conducted using SmartPLS 4.0. The findings reveal that GenAI usability does not directly affect users' enjoyment; instead, its influence is transmitted indirectly through several psychological mediators. Specifically, GenAI usability significantly enhances perceived ease of use, usefulness, curiosity, joy, and control, each of which contributes to users’ enjoyment, with joy demonstrating the strongest mediating effect. Although GenAI usability also increases users’ sense of immersion, immersion itself does not significantly predict enjoyment. These results extend the applicability of HMSAM in the cultural technology domain, deepen the theoretical understanding of user behavior in smart museums, and offer practical guidance for optimizing GenAI-based interactive system design in cultural heritage contexts.},

  abstract = {In the age of Artificial Intelligence, college students have adapted to interact with the world in a new media ecosystem. Since the era of web 2.0, social networking site (SNS) combined attributes of interpersonal communication technology and mass media, and its arrival made “many to many” interaction mode easily available. Young people especially rely on social media to socialize, entertain, seek information, and present themselves. Scholars and educators have paid more and more attention to the youth digital literacy as well as their new media literacy. How college students’ social media involvement influences their psychological well-being has been researchers’ concerns. To better understand current situation of college students’ social media literacy, this empirical research conducted a survey on college students’ social media use behavior and stress coping preferences. A total of 431 undergraduate students participated in an online survey in 2023. Three mediators between student participants’ individualized social media involvement and their adaptive stress coping are tested by AMOS. A few social network attributes are tested as moderators through multiple linear regression by SPSS.  Findings suggest that college students’ social media involvement assist their psychological well-being in some way. Sample students’ frequency of participating in social media groups is positively related of adaptive stress coping.

However, sample students’ online role modeling behavior is negatively associated with their adaptive stress coping. Implications of these findings are further discussed.},

  abstract = {In recent years, society has witnessed accelerated advancement in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies, which may be viewed as a double-edged sword. On one hand, GenAI tools can be used to create synthetic content legitimately. For example, advertising agencies may, with permission, generate celebrities’ images or videos using GenAI tools without putting them in front of cameras and thus reducing the overall cost of media construction. On the other hand, scammers may utilize GenAI tools to craft or edit artificial content (for example, texts, images, videos, or audio), so-called deepfakes, to mislead or deceive netizens with robocalls or voice cloning phishing, potentially causing detrimental consequences for society. This article briefly debates emerging socioeconomic threats of deepfakes in today’s society and how cyber-wellness (or digital media literacy) education can help netizens mitigate their risks.To the mitigate the risks of deepfakes, enhanced cyber-wellness programs are needed that empower both producers and consumers of generative AI–based content.},

Traditional software verification techniques often rely on manual effort, which can be time-consuming and error prone. However, with recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing opportunity to automate and improve software verification activities. This paper describes how Generative AI, particularly LLMs, can facilitate software verification activities, including understanding of documentation, code analysis, bug detection and testing.

Aimed at the AI and smart manufacturing's development in large volume and speed, English standard terminology could make international cooperation, information communication and industry standard more effective. There are main difficulties include the multidenoting and the obscurity of words, the rate new jargon, the confusion difference of industry and in language-culture difficulties, particularly language not English.For these challenges, the paper suggests ways: to establish authoritative terminology databases (i.e., ISO/TC 37) that regularly updates their definitions and use for latest version; to intensify collaborations of global and national standard bodies to create one single norm, develop one single standard to define their terminologies usage, to design for the rules of translation to reflect consistent terminologies use, and professionals’ terminology literacy in using terms. Three cases from authors show how those approaches help cross-industry and cross-cultural communications, including use of digital twin to advance the development of aircrafts, automotive, and automobile production in detail.Our research attempt combining linguistics, artificial intelligence, and manufacturing engineering in the presentation of not only theoretical foundations but also practical references for assisting effective international cooperation and normalized development of AI and smart manufacturing. In the further study, we expand the case of study on larger ranges of cultures and industrial fields in order to realize more effective terminology standardization for the current emerging technologies.},

This context-aware and semantic-rich embedding is made possible using state-of-the-art technology, including attention mechanism and knowledge graph embedding. The learning structure of the model foreshadows the traditional Chinese medicine teaching model and cultivates students as good at in-depth understanding and creative application of knowledge. Furthermore, through transfer learning and domain-specific fine-tuning, the framework attains high fidelity of captured knowledge representation while also supporting the generation of new hypotheses and therapeutics. Our generative AI model improves knowledge transfer accuracy and depth, and encourage innovative thinking compared to traditional educational methodologies, as we demonstrate through experimental results.},

  abstract = {Aiming at the problem of large differences in feature information between different targets in remote sensing images and the complexity of the scene, an improved SwinIR Transformer remote sensing image super-resolution reconstruction algorithm is proposed, combining residual hybrid attention and spatial-gate feed-forward network. First, a new residual hybrid attention module (RHAB) is constructed, which is serially combined with multiple self-attention (MSA) to enhance feature extraction by mixing channel attention (CA), spatial attention (SA), and MSA, and to improve the model's ability in modeling locally and globally relevant information. Second, a spatial-gate feed-forward network (SGFN) is used instead of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) in the original network to effectively reduce redundant channel information, overcome the limitations of the MLP in dealing with local spatial features, and enhance the feature expression efficiency. The experiments use NWPU-RESISC45 and UCMerced_LandUse as the training set, RSOD-Dataset, RSSCN7 Data Set, and WHU-RS19 Data Set as the test set, and the model performance is evaluated by PSNR and SSIM metrics. The experimental results confirm that the model in this paper shows excellent performance in both objective evaluation and subjective visualization.},

This paper attempts to enhance the detection performance of small targets by integrating the bionic perception of brain-inspired intelligence with the data augmentation capabilities of generative models. Firstly, we simulate the multi-scale attention mechanism of the biological visual system using a brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN), enhancing the spatial sensitivity of small target detection. Secondly, we generate high-quality small target samples and optimize local feature representation through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), alleviating data scarcity and feature ambiguity. This paper proposes for the first time a solution providing a cross-modal collaborative framework for small target detection, exploring the potential of combining brain-inspired mechanisms with generative models.},

  abstract = {Reactive synthesis, or simply synthesis, is primarily used to automatically generate control-intensive programs. Applications of reactive synthesis span various domains, including robot motion planning, autonomous system control, and communication protocol development. This paper investigates the reactive synthesis for formulas expressed in Real-Time Linear Dynamic Logic over finite traces (RTLDLf). RTLDLf is more expressive than Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf). While RTLDLf and Linear Dynamic Logic over finite traces (LDLf) share equivalent expressive power, RTLDLf offers greater simplicity in its logical constructs compared to LDLf. Existing synthesis methods for LDLf predominantly rely on automata-based approaches. In this paper, we propose an RTLDLf synthesis method based on temporal testers. We first translate an RTLDLf specification into a temporal tester, a non-deterministic transducer. The tester is then transformed into a graph game between the system and the environment. We finally propose a symbolic algorithm to solve the game to derive a winning strategy for the system player. The proposed method has two advantages: (1) high composability, enabling convenient and efficient synthesis of complex RTLDLf formulas, and (2) symbolic representation of the tester's transition relations and state space, which facilitates the use of efficient symbolic algorithms based on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams.},

Recently, I have been inundated with questions, concerns, and critiques about the rise of augmentation technologies in writing and design processes, particularly generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools that support chat-based text generation and text-to-image production. I'm sure many UX researchers and designers face similar issues in their work. It remains unclear how generative AI should fit into existing workflow or design processes. Common questions include these:• How does AI work? What can it do? Is it free?• Is it cheating if I use AI to produce content?• Who is responsible for the quality of AI-generated content?• To what extent can I outsource my routine work to AI? In other words, what's an acceptable threshold for using AI before it is considered too much?Specific to UX is the value (cost and labor versus gains and effects) of generative AI in the research and design of user-centered products. Students in my UX courses are increasingly worried about the presence of AI and, consequently, the relevance of their developing skill sets in UX. Educators are growing wary about the presence of AI in the context of teaching and learning; many form partially informed decisions on academic policies for AI usage.},

  abstract = {Teaching computer science at scale can be challenging. From our experience in CS50, Harvard University's introductory course, we've seen firsthand the impactful role that generative artificial intelligence can play in education. Recognizing its potential and stakes, we integrated OpenAI's GPT into our own teaching methodology. The goal was to emulate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio, incorporating "pedagogical guardrails" to maintain instructional integrity. The result was a personalized, AI-powered bot in the form of a friendly rubber duck aimed at delivering instructional responses and troubleshooting without giving outright solutions. In this tutorial, we share our journey and offer insights into responsibly harnessing AI in educational settings. Participants will gain hands-on experience working with GPT through OpenAI's latest APIs, understanding and crafting prompts, answering questions using embedding-based search, and finally, collaboratively building their own AI chatbot. Ultimately, we'll not only share lessons learned from our own approach but also equip educators hands-on with the knowledge and tools with which they, too, can implement these technologies in their unique teaching environments.},

  abstract = {When referring to the role of newly proposed clinical applications of artificial intelligence (AI), recent work inflationary uses the term Human-AI Team. However, the roles foreseen for AI systems within teams remain unclear. We systematically reviewed the literature on AI deployment in anesthesiology and found that most AI system papers only describe algorithms. We identified 57 interactive systems and assigned six roles based on described behavior, tasks, and interactions. While the most prevalent role was task completer, some AI systems also served their team as problem solvers, evaluators, task motivators, or even teamwork support and team leaders. We contribute (1) a classification system for team roles, behaviors, tasks, and interactions of AI team members and (2) an overview of AI systems’ team roles in anesthesiology. We conclude that (3) AI systems’ intended social roles within teams need to be more consciously reflected, shaped and clearly communicated to meet healthcare standards.},

  abstract = {The proposal focuses on the implementation of a personalized service platform that integrates and trains data using the GPT model (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) to improve customer satisfaction by responding to their requests accurately, promptly, and swiftly. The proposed methodology for the technological model integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and GPT technologies, allowing the loading of documents in different formats, such as PDF and Markdown documents, which are then analyzed using the aforementioned technologies to respond to customer requests precisely, enabling a more personalized and efficient interaction. For testing the technological model, a prototype was designed, from which the level of satisfaction of a sample of 50 customers was evaluated after interacting with the application and the traditional method. As a result, it was observed that customers experienced a satisfaction level of 59.4\% when served traditionally, while with the technological model interaction, they recorded an average satisfaction of 92.6\%. Therefore, the research concludes that the proposed technological model represents an opportunity to efficiently address customer service requests, providing a more effective and satisfactory service, which also implies the optimization of resources and costs for an organization.},

  abstract = {The distributed computing paradigm of edge computing effectively addresses the challenges of data transmission delay and data privacy security. With the increasing popularity of IoT devices and 5 G networks, edge computing has a broader range of applications. The advancement in AI technology enables the realization of edge intelligence, which conducts data processing and analysis on edge devices to avoid excessive data transmission to the cloud, enhance system response speed, and protect user data privacy. In various edge intelligent systems like smart homes and autonomous driving, multimodal data plays a crucial role. However, missing modalities in such systems may lead to model failure in real-world environments. To tackle this issue, we propose a tensor-empowered modality reconstruction network (TMRN) that utilizes an end-to-end variational autoencoder for reconstructing missing modal data. This approach effectively enhances model robustness while reducing model size and training complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised method for feature reconstruction to better align with the true distribution of missing modal data by leveraging tensor feature fusion and label supervision techniques. Additionally, we design a task information disentanglement module to make multimodal representations more relevant to specific tasks by effectively separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TMRN achieves competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Against the backdrop of digital transformation in educational management, student performance prediction, as a core function of educational decision support systems, directly affects the development of personalized teaching strategies and the optimization of educational resource allocation. Traditional prediction methods, such as linear regression and machine learning models, often have low accuracy due to neglecting the correlation between disciplinary features and the non-linear distribution of data. Although deep learning models such as LSTM and Transformer have advantages in feature extraction and sequence modeling, their hyperparameter sensitivity and local optimal traps still constrain the model's generalization ability. Therefore, how to further improve the accuracy of the model through intelligent optimization algorithms has become a key issue in enhancing the reliability of educational prediction. Therefore, in response to the problem of student performance prediction in educational management decision-making, this study proposes an improved algorithm (PSO-MPA) based on a mixture of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and marine predator algorithm (MPA) to optimize the predictive performance of deep learning models. The experimental results showed that PSO-MPA achieved accuracy rates of 81.81\%, 86.85\%, and 83.39\% in predicting English, mathematics, and psychology, respectively, with an average accuracy rate of 84.02\%, which is 0.53\% and 0.84\% higher than the traditional MPA algorithm (83.49\%) and the basic PSO algorithm (83.18\%), respectively. Especially in mathematics subject prediction, PSO-MPA exhibits significant advantages (86.85\%), verifying the synergistic effect of hybrid strategies in feature optimization and global search capabilities, providing a more accurate intelligent prediction tool for educational decision-making.},

This method only requires a small amount of human scoring to train the model. Experiments on real data demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively identifies responses that need re-evaluation, thereby improving the overall grading quality.},

  abstract = {With the rapid advancement of generative AI, co-creation has emerged as a key interaction paradigm, enabling humans and AI to collaborate in creative processes. However, despite decades of research on co-creativity, recent AI developments often lack a structured framework to integrate these insights effectively. To address this gap, we propose the Co-Creative Design Framework (CCDF), which formalizes human-AI co-creation through cognitive and interaction principles. The framework is structured around three core dimensions: agency, which defines the balance of autonomy and control between user and AI; interaction dynamics, which describe the evolving relationship between collaborators and their shared creative product; and communication, which governs information exchange between human and AI. The CCDF provides a systematic approach to modeling co-creative AI and hybrid intelligence systems, defining key dimensions of variance that shape the interaction space of co-creation. In particular, it highlights agency and interaction dynamics, which have been underexplored in recent co-creative AI frameworks. This paper details the iterative development of CCDF, synthesizing insights from co-creativity literature and AI research. We apply the framework in a comparative analysis of Traditional ChatGPT, ChatGPT Canvas Mode, and DALL-E, demonstrating its ability to capture fine-grained differences in system design and user experience.},

This study delves into external characteristics such as publication volume, participating countries, research institutions, and authorship to uncover the key issues and evolving trends in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) research in Africa. The research shows that the number of AI studies in Africa has seen an "explosive" growth in recent years, with AI solutions being applied on a large scale. The development of AI in Africa primarily revolves around addressing practical needs in areas such as agriculture, food security, disease, and education, leading to significant achievements. However, challenges remain, including a lack of widespread international collaboration, a small core research community, and issues related to the localization of data and technology application. Looking ahead, strengthening international cooperation, enhancing local research and innovation capabilities, and addressing challenges related to data and technology application will be key to the continued growth of AI research in Africa.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development and widespread application of artificial intelligence technologies, the global employment landscape is undergoing profound changes. The demand for low-skilled jobs is decreasing, while the demand for high-skilled jobs is increasing. This study selects labour market data for major economies from 2015 to 2024, and applies regression and cluster analysis to explore the intrinsic link between the degree of technology penetration and labour restructuring.The study finds that AI technologies have replaced around a quarter of low-skilled jobs in manufacturing, while at the same time high-skilled jobs such as data science and AI development have grown rapidly, further widening the skills gap. Moreover, the impact has varied significantly across countries and industries. Developed countries have experienced a massive loss of low-skill jobs and a dramatic increase in high-skill jobs, while developing countries have experienced similar trends, but with relatively smaller changes.Based on the above findings, the study makes a series of targeted policy recommendations, including strengthening vocational training, promoting industrial upgrading, improving the social security system, and enhancing the adaptability of the labour force, with the aim of mitigating the impact of AI on the employment structure and promoting the smooth development of the labour market.},

  abstract = {When graduates of computing degree programs enter the software industry, they will most likely join teams working on legacy code bases developed by people other than themselves. In these so-called brownfield software development settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences undergraduate students’ programming performance, behaviors, and understanding when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10 undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 34.9\% faster (p &lt; 0.05) and made 50.0\% more solution progress (p &lt; 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover, our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 10.6\% less time manually writing code (p &lt; 0.05), and 11.6\% less time conducting web searches (p &lt; 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that leverage GenAI assistants’ benefits while fostering reflection on how and why GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks. Complete study results and analysis are presented at ghcopilot-icer.github.io.},

  abstract = {Software engineering has been a crucial discipline to support the advancement of our modern world, since software systems power all segments of society. This is possible due to the development of the discipline in the last decades, to a state in which we have qualified people (software engineers, practitioners, and researchers), proper processes, and cutting-edge technologies. To achieve this current state, the discipline of software engineering has been advanced by private companies, open-source communities, government agencies, and universities. What do all those different institutions have in common? They have talented, smart, and creative people. The doctoral degree is the highest academic degree, focusing on educating and preparing talented, smart, and creative people. While the discipline of software engineering has seen great development, the new demands from society and the emergence of new technologies (e.g., generative artificial intelligence, quantum computing, Internet of Things) create new challenges and uncover old ones. In this context, the current generation of doctoral students will be in charge of taming such new technologies to meet the demands for the benefit of humanity. Given this crucial role of doctoral students in the future of software engineering, we need to discuss what the expectations, responsibilities, benefits, and barriers are faced by a doctoral student. In this talk, I share my experiences as a software developer, doctoral student, post-doc researcher, and professor directly working with software engineering in the past 20 years. This talk aims to inspire and guide students as they navigate the complexities and milestones of their doctoral studies. The topics of talk involve collaboration with your pairs, publication of your work results, understanding your community (e.g., researchers and practitioners working on the domain of variability and systematic reuse), what students should do and what they should not do, and some provocative discussion to motivate critical thinking by the audience. After the talk, the students will be equipped with practical suggestions and advice so that they can avoid pitfalls, recognize good opportunities to grow, and plan their future careers.},

This paper explores the practical application and effects of GenAI in tiered teaching implementation and student English capability development for higher vocational students upgrading to undergraduate colleges by using a mixed-methods approach. The study observed measurable improvements in students' language proficiency, application ability, and critical thinking skills. Specifically, instant feedback from AI allowed them to refine the grammar, translation, writing and other language skills when they finish personalized learning and human-AI collaborative tasks. However, the survey also reveals technology dependency and insufficient evaluation criteria for AI-enabled tasks. To solve these problems, the author suggested to implement “human-AI collaboration” mode to concentrate on proper evaluation criteria, ethical education, and dynamic monitoring mechanisms. By doing so, it will be worthy data in English education and verify the unique value of GenAI in balancing college education with personalized cultivation.},

  abstract = {The application of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the strategic decision-making patterns of enterprises. To clarify the influence mechanism of AI on corporate strategic decision-making, to elucidate the mechanisms through which AI influences corporate strategic decision-making, this study uses Chinese A-share listed companies from 2013 to 2023 as a sample to empirically examine the impact of AI on strategic decision-making. The research finds that AI application significantly increases the overall strategic deviance of enterprises, supporting the "differentiation effect" hypothesis. Sub-dimensional tests show that AI drives enterprises to significantly deviate from industry norms in advertising investment, R&amp;D intensity, and fixed asset renewal, demonstrating characteristics of "active innovation"; while in the dimensions of capital intensity and financial leverage, enterprises tend to approach industry averages, reflecting a "rational contraction" tendency. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the strategic value of AI and offers practical insights for enterprises to optimize their technology application paths.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has attained human-level performance in tasks like text summarization, machine translation, and code generation while handling multimodal data. Despite these advances, AI poses challenges such as generating false or biased outputs, causing discrimination, and exhibiting opaque decision-making processes that hinder bias mitigation. Additionally, training large language models (LLMs) for AI consumes substantial energy and can enable autonomous warfare, posing a threat to eco-justice, and raising sustainability concerns. Their ability to create realistic content poses the risk of misuse and perpetuating misinformation. This article addresses these ethical issues and presents solutions through regulation and technology, with examples of global legislation tackling algorithmic discrimination and consumer rights. It emphasizes the need for a workforce skilled in navigating an AI-driven world. Future research directions touch upon mechanistic interpretability to understand AI outputs, new approaches to natural language processing and multimodal data understanding, and developing more interpretable neural network architectures with fewer parameters. This article summarizes the tutorial on the topic that includes some of the author’s work in related areas.},

Understanding how PR students view and respond to this technological shift is becoming necessary to education and career choice. This study examined how Chinese PR students' perceptions of AI affect their career choices in PR through the lens of social cognitive career theory (SCCT). The study investigated the relationships between AI self-efficacy, outcome expectation of AI, interest in AI, AI contextual support and barrier, and PR career choice. Using an online questionnaire, the researcher collected data from 444 PR students at a Chinese university. SPSS was used to analyze the data, and reliability analysis, exploratory factor analysis, correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis were conducted to test the hypothesized relationships among the variables. The regression results indicated that AI self-efficacy, outcome expectation of AI, interest in AI, and AI contextual support positively influenced students' intention to pursue a career in PR. AI contextual barrier showed a significant negative impact on PR career choice. This study contributes to understanding how emerging technologies affect career decisions in PR education and has important implications for curriculum development and career guidance. It suggests that PR educators should focus on developing students' AI competencies while fostering their professional interests and that institutions should provide adequate support systems for AI learning. In addition, the findings provide valuable insights for PR programs that prepare students for an AI-enhanced industry.},

From automating test case design to enabling continuous testing in DevOps pipelines, AI-driven tools enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and speed of software testing. At the same time, the integration of AI components into software-reliant systems introduces new challenges for verification and validation (V&amp;V). Traditional T&amp;E methodologies must evolve to address issues such as AI bias, hallucinated outputs, and the complexity of validating non-deterministic behaviors. This position paper examines how existing T&amp;E methods must evolve to account for AI's stochastic nature, and conversely how GenAI is transforming T&amp;E practices across the software development lifecycle (SDLC).},

It examines two different subsidy strategies and creates an evolutionary game model of AI medical technology diffusion in the context of a Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) network. The two subsidy strategies are analyzed in detail, factoring in the maturity of the technology, the initial proportion of firms, and the initial proportion of hospitals. The study finds that: 1) Government subsidies fixed in advance negatively affect technology diffusion when the maturity of the technology is uncertain. 2) Increased proportion of high-share hospitals increased the spread of AI technology because the enhanced market share benefits the firms using AI technology which causes them to attract other firms to copy that strategy. 3) From the perspective of the uncertainty of effectiveness, the adaptive subsidies perform better than fixed subsidies across all scenarios. 4) A higher initial proportion of hospitals using AI results in greater spreads of AI technology. The governments are recommended to use adaptive subsidies and to focus support on hospitals in order to reduce the barriers to entry. The government should also provide infrastructure and establish more higher-level hospitals to allow for the more effective use of resources.},

This paper proposes hybrid learning through AI-based intelligent recommendation and adaptive learning techniques as a solution. Statistics from the students' learning history and behavioural data are used with deep learning for the prediction of students' learning needs accurate enough to recommend personalised resources. Students' progress in understanding is checked through natural language processing before further personalisation. The complexity of the learning content then changes dynamically in accordance to every individual. The tasks of collecting data, training the proposed model, optimising its algorithm, and validating the experiments therein are undertaken. The experiments find that the performance of student learning using the hybrid model improved by 9.3\%, reduced learning time by 15.5\%, and improved finding the right recommendation by about 23.8\% compared to the non-intelligent platform. In conclusion, the study proves that Ai and open learning, in practice, can increase the efficiency of learning and enhance the learning experience, providing a way to bridge the equity in education with personalised education.},

  abstract = {In this empirical study, the researchers delved deep into the multidimensional impacts of generative AI on vocational English learning among Chinese students. Mixed methods analysis of 46 participants from Beijing Polytechnic were conducted. In this study, both positive feedback on generative AI's roles and concerns about the shortcomings were investigated. What's more, qualitative insights based on the open-ended questions highlight demands for balanced integration and ethical guidelines when using artificial intelligent tool in language learning. Based on the data and results, actionable recommendations to not only educators and students, but also developers are proposed, so as to solve the current obstacles holistically. Researchers hence advocate a “human-AI collaborative” model to maximize AI's strengths while at the same time addressing risks, offering a series of actionable strategies for educators to improve language learning in vocational English learning contexts.},

  abstract = {The Myth of the Cave is an artwork generated by artificial intelligence (AI), a co-creation that reinterprets Plato's famous allegory to invite us to reflect on how we perceive and understand reality. Using photographs recovered from historical archives, images that documented everyday reality (1900-1930), AI is integrated into the creative process to offer a speculative prediction of the moments captured in silver gelatin. Apparently, they are fictitious recreations generated by AI, however, the piece visually explores, from the generated story, the intersubjective mechanisms in which we build our historical memory. It is a dialogue with the past to develop a story of the future recreated by an algorithm that has been fed by collective imaginaries. A technology that allows us to observe not only the shadows projected in the cave, but also the fire that generates them, the objects that create these shadows and the forces that control the experience.},

  abstract = {Purpose–The purpose of this paper is to examine how social media influencers' adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to create posts content disclosure affects their followers' responses.Design/methodology/approach–In this paper, two experiments were designed to fit the real situation. The variable scales involved in the experiments were mature scales, and ANOVA and the process in SPSS were used for testing.Findings–Study 1 indicates that followers react negatively to influencers' adoption of GenAI for social media production, which is mitigated when influencers engage in honesty-based motive explanation disclosure. Study 2 reveals that influencer motive attribution and perceived influencers' authenticity play chain-mediated roles in the effects of GenAI's adoption of disclosure type on followers' attitudes and behaviors.Originality/value–First, this study extends the GenAI marketing literature, which is still in its infancy, to provide a novel idea and framework for studying social media content creation by GenAI. Second, this study draws on the literature in the field of sponsored disclosure to further demonstrate the potential effectiveness of similar motive explanation for this approach.},

However, while generative AI is deeply embedded in Chinese society, it also impacts personal information security on a large scale, challenges national security, causes intellectual property rights disputes, and academic ethics irregularities. Therefore, it is necessary for the national regulatory authorities to exercise careful governance, formulate accurate and fair market access guidelines and mechanism accountability systems, improve the public's awareness of risk prevention, and gradually improve the generative AI governance system.},

  abstract = {In the face of the high requirements of vocational education for practical skills training, as well as the poor results and high costs of traditional training, this study aims to build an efficient and intelligent virtual training and simulation operation platform by introducing generative artificial intelligence technology to improve teaching quality and learning efficiency. This paper uses the adversarial generation ability of GAN and combines it with the knowledge graph in the field of vocational education to generate a high-fidelity and scalable virtual training environment. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to dynamically adjust the scene parameters to adapt to the needs of different majors and skill levels. Based on the Transformer multimodal dialogue model, a real-time operation guidance system integrating virtual and real is constructed. The physical engine is combined to simulate the feedback of equipment operation, and the long short-term memory network (LSTM) is used to capture the characteristics of the trainee's operation sequence, dynamically predict potential errors and trigger correction prompts. This paper also uses the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to build a personalized evaluation agent, using the trainee's operation data as the state space to generate targeted training suggestions. The average operation accuracy of the experimental group students reaches 89.715\%, the highest skill assessment pass rate reaches 100\%, and the overall distribution is more concentrated, reducing the cost of practical training. In addition, teachers and students highly evaluated the teaching adaptability, operation guidance and error correction functions of the platform. The teaching platform proposed in this study provides a new path and strategy for the modernization of vocational education.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and the upgrading of industrial structure, the demand changes in the labor market show more complex dynamic characteristics, and it is difficult for traditional statistical and machine learning methods to accurately predict market trends. In order to improve the prediction accuracy and model adaptability, this paper proposes a labor demand prediction model based on generative adversarial deep learning (GADL) and multi-modal data fusion. The model uses generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate supplementary data to compensate for data scarcity, combined with convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer to conduct multimodal feature extraction, and finally time series modeling by long and short-term memory network (LSTM). The experimental results show that the GADL model is better than the LSTM and ARIMA method in several key performance indicators, and the mean square error (MSE) is reduced to 5\% of the traditional method, and the determination coefficient (R²) reaches 0.9966, which significantly improves the prediction accuracy. The research shows that GADL model can more effectively capture the changing trend of labor market and provide data support for the optimization of government employment policy, enterprise human resource planning and talent training in universities. The study in this paper provides a new methodology for labor market prediction and lays the foundation for subsequent research.},

Even for those automatically generated using artificial intelligence (AI), it is not well understood whether or how they affect learning outcomes, user experience, and trust. To address this gap, we developed ReelsEd, which is a web-based system that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate structured short-form video (i.e., reels) from lecture long-form videos while preserving instructor-authored material. In a between-subject user study with 62 university students, we evaluated ReelsEd and demonstrated that it outperformed traditional long-form videos in engagement, quiz performance, and task efficiency without increasing cognitive load. Learners expressed high trust in our system and valued its clarity, usefulness, and ease of navigation. Our findings point to new design opportunities for integrating generative AI into educational tools that prioritize usability, learner agency, and pedagogical alignment.},

The results show that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm all have a significant positive impact on behavior intention of dishonesty when online learning. Specifically, the attitude of dishonest behaviors in online learning is influenced by autonomous motivation (e.g., intrinsic interest, self-improvement) and controlled motivation (e.g., external rewards, avoidance of punishments); perceived behavioral control is influenced by autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and moral obligation; and the subjective norm is not only affected by autonomous motivation but also by moral obligation. Based on this, this study proposes some interventions to mitigate dishonest behaviors in online learning to create a good learning atmosphere for the online learning environment.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in optimizing the 3D printing industry. AI is developing fast, with a large number of applications shown, such as polishing the statement. The rapid development of AI has allowed its integration into various sectors, including 3D printing. While the applications of AI in many industrial systems have been identified by existing studies, the applications of this emerging technology in another promising technology – 3D printing – have been largely unexplored. This points out the necessity of conducting researches on this issue to facilitate the further development of both AI and 3D printing technologies. This study examines the application of AI across different phases of 3D printing, such as design, usage, production, and maintenance. AI enhances the efficiency of 3D printing by providing generative design alternatives, automating parameter settings, optimizing process controls, and improving product quality through real-time monitoring. AI's ability to store and analyze vast amounts of data enables better decision-making, predictive maintenance, and customized production, reducing costs and enhancing production capabilities.

Requirements Engineering (RE), a critical phase in software development, involves gathering and defining software requirements. However, research on the impact of GenAI and LLMs within RE remains limited. This paper examines the adoption of GenAI in RE, with the aim of exploring its practical implications, identifying current research trends, and highlighting areas for future development. To achieve this, a systematic literature review was conducted, addressing three research questions and analyzing 44 studies published over the past decade. The findings reveal that GenAI models, especially LLMs, are extensively employed in a variety of RE tasks, underscoring the versatility and potential of LLMs in enhancing the RE process.},

  abstract = {Content analysis is a common research method in technical and professional communication (TPC) journals. But TPC content analyses often lack intercoder reliability (ICR) statistics, possibly due to the lack of resources required to train human coders. This proof-of-concept study explores the viability of replacing a second coder with a generative AI tool to calculate an ICR. Using three previously published studies, I calculated a Krippendorff's alpha for various data types and various codebooks using non-modified versions of five popular generative AI tools. While the tools could code TPC data, most tools did not produce alphas strong enough to replace human coders. While it is premature in most cases to replace human coders with generative AI tools to calculate an ICR, generative AI may prove to be useful to researchers as a means of codebook and unit of analysis refinement prior to human coding.},

  abstract = {This study introduces the use of cognitive-enhanced artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education and the future-oriented intelligent learning ecosystem. AI technology is transforming higher education by creating personalized and adaptive learning systems that address the weaknesses of the traditional, one-size-fits-all system. AI-powered solutions personalize learning experiences around the specific needs of students, which, in turn, will lead to better educational outcomes and inclusivity. The five main ingredients to make AI integration work are identified, which constitute a holistic framework for practitioner implementation: AI capabilities, student characteristics, teacher roles, learning environment optimization, and technological ecosystems. The research explores AI's capacity to personalize learning, redefine teaching roles and transform learning spaces by reviewing recent literature and case studies. While there has been considerable movement, barriers remain, including cost of implementation, teacher training needs, and concerns around data privacy. They provide actionable recommendations for overcoming these barriers, point to the need for hybrid teaching models, and make a case for strong data governance frameworks. It highlights AI's potential to disrupt higher education, yielding systems that are more equitable, efficient, and secure.},

The permanence of fingerprints means security breaches can have lasting impacts. Traditionally, organizations store only fingerprint templates to mitigate the risks associated with stolen fingerprint images. However, advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly deepfake technologies, now enable adversaries to generate fingerprints from stolen templates, increasing the threat of data breaches.In this paper, we demonstrate and validate a previously theorized threat by evaluating an end-to-end attack in the physical world. Our approach involves: (1) generating fingerprint images from unseen templates, (2) fabricating silicone replicas of these deepfake fingerprints using a 3D resin printer, and (3) successfully deceiving fingerprint scanners with the replicas. The entire lab setup cost only $440 USD and only 7 cents to replicate each fingerprint thereafter, highlighting the attack's practicality.To support reproducibility and encourage the development of defenses, we publicly release our deepfake fingerprint pipeline.},

  abstract = {Knowledge discovery from databases (KDD) and data mining (DM) belong to the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The integration of AI into various segments of the construction industry is still in its infancy, but it is expected to be used more widely soon, driven by the development of databases and data warehouses. By using Building Information Modelling (BIM) technologies in the planning of new buildings, we will be able to obtain valuable data. The situation is different for old, existing buildings and the building engineering associated with these properties. Civil engineers, renovation planners and architects need knowledge of the building before renovation. This knowledge is much less than the possibilities that exist. Information about the building can be found in provincial archives. For historic buildings, 10\%–15\% of the plans, drawings, descriptions, or projects are available. The remaining 85\% must be researched on site, which is a lengthy and costly process and hinders the construction process. The question arose as to how the findings from the study of buildings based on written and preserved sources can be applied to 85\% of buildings for which no data is available. This paper presents the use of the collected data as an idea for an initiative to develop a database and modelling using AI algorithms. The research study investigates the feature “load-bearing wall” for residential buildings with basements and floors built between 1857 and 1948 in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. The aim of this study is to create a model to predict the characteristics of a building for which no archival material is available. The study is based on the use of AI in the creation of decision trees to help engineers improve their knowledge of historic buildings in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire and building engineering for historic objects.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the students' perceptions of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in upper-secondary mathematics education. Data was collected from Finnish high school students to represent how key constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model—Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Enjoyment, and Intention to Use—influence the adoption of AI tools. First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how AI tools can be integrated into mathematics education and highlights key differences between the Finnish educational context and previous studies based on structural equation modeling.},

Yet, GenAI also offers opportunities for designing tools for thought that protect and augment cognition. Such systems provoke critical thinking, provide personalized tutoring, or enable novel ways of sensemaking, among other approaches. How does GenAI change workflows and human cognition?

  abstract = {Synthetic traffic traces are useful for training traffic classifiers in privacy-constrained environments. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models are blossoming as a solution to avoid the sharing of real data and the lack of datasets. Never the less ,privacy concerns about GAI are often under-estimated. Therefore, an approach to mitigate the data leakage of a GAI is presented in this paper, with a minimum impact on the utility of synthetic traffic traces for downstream applications. For example, training a Machine Learning (ML) traffic classifier on synthetic traffic traces results in an average accuracy loss of no more than 13\% concerning training on a real dataset.},

Therefore, recommendation frameworks play an important role and their usage is beneficial for a unification of education profiles in a systematic way. This  research is contributing to this development by exploring how a recommendation for the domain of Business Informatics in German speaking countries can be improved by formalizing the recommendations in a semantic model that relies on sophisticated European ontologies in the domain like the European Learning Model (ELM) and related data models. It employs Generative Artificial Intelligence Systems to create semantic models in an experimental way and evaluates the resulting model quality. The results show that a formalization using GenAI has a high potential, but currently also shows deficits in the correctness of the resulting models, requiring human oversight during the model creation.},

  abstract = {Formal communications such as public calls, announcements, or regulations are supposed to exhibit respect for diversity in terms of gender, race, age, and disability. However, human writers often lack adequate inclusive writing skills. For instance, they tend to overuse the masculine as a neutral form, mainly because they are self-trained on biased text examples. To overcome this issue, we propose to leverage Generative Artificial Intelligence to support inclusive language writing. Focusing on formal Italian communications, we have designed and developed an AI-assisted tool for non-inclusive text detection and reformulation. Thanks to the joint work with a team of linguistic experts, we first define a set of linguistic criteria necessary to model inclusive writing forms in Italian. Based on these criteria, we collect and annotate a dataset of Italian administrative documents enriched with fine-grained inclusive annotations. Finally, we train deep learning models on the collected data for non-inclusive language detection and inclusive language reformulation tasks. We perform quantitative and human-driven evaluations on the trained models. The best detection model correctly classifies 89\% of the sentences, whereas the best reformulation model produces 73\% fully correct reformulations. Both models have been integrated into a writing assistance tool acting as a text proofreader and self-learning tool for non-expert writers, namely Inclusively. Once a non-inclusive piece of text is detected, the proposed approach suggests inclusive reformulations. The tool also provides explanations of the models’ outputs to increase system transparency. Furthermore, it allows expert end-users to provide further annotations for system fine-tuning. The trained models and the writing assistance tool are publicly available for research purposes.},

Our focus is on empirical studies that either use LLMs as part of the research process or studies that evaluate existing or new tools that are based on LLMs. This paper contributes the first set of holistic guidelines for such studies.

Central to this need are message brokers, which serve as essential channels for data transfer within various system components. This survey aims at delving into a comprehensive analysis of traditional and modern message brokers based on a variety of criteria, highlighting their critical role in enabling efficient data exchange in distributed AI systems. Furthermore, we explore the intrinsic constraints that the design and operation of each message broker might impose, highlighting their impact on real-world applicability. Finally, this study explores the enhancement of message broker mechanisms tailored to GenAI environments.

This paper introduces a novel generative traffic flow model that employs a generative pretrained Transformer to capture multi-agent interactions and detect anomalies in traffic patterns. We introduce a two-stage tokenization process for set-structured traffic data, efficiently encoding variable-sized agent states into fixed-length sequences suitable for generative modeling. We demonstrate that anomalies, which often indicate potential hazards or non-compliant behaviors, can be identified as deviations from learned normal interaction patterns among agents through a zero-shot detection mechanism. Our experimental results in simulated urban settings highlight the model's capability to detect various types of traffic anomalies with high accuracy. This work significantly advances agent-based traffic modeling and underscores its potential for enhancing traffic safety and efficiency in multi-agent systems.},

  abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) represent a significant share of global resource usage. Notably, the energy consumption of data centres has emerged as a critical concern, escalating rapidly, especially with the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. This surge in energy demand calls for efforts focused on measuring and reducing the energy and carbon footprints of components used in ICT service delivery. However, the variety and multitude of devices involved in these services make it challenging to accurately measure and evaluate these footprints.In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to assess energy impacts by considering data centres for what they are: throughput computing systems offering ICT services. We define a simple experimental testbed and evaluate several machines with different hardware capacities. These machines serve two ICT services: a loop incrementing a counter until a defined limit, and an AI inference predicting the next token based on an input.Our experiment highlights three main take-aways: (a) the CPU usage is a poor predictor of the power consumption, (b) the energy or CO2 quantity associated with a service visit highly depends on the total load the service is facing, and (c) modern machines do not yield better energy figures compared to older ones in all circumstances.},

A widely used method is the Variational Color Shift (VCS), which can automatically predict a range of color shifts for each image. The algorithm has significant overfitting when applied to text images that are highly interfered with and contain noise, which hinders further improvements in text recognition accuracy. In this study, we submit a new transformed layer inside the VCS framework using cyclic boundary shifts over the text images. A new module, Transformed Variational Color Shift (TVCS) is proposed. This method integrates a generalized set of colors (the original dataset) in a manner that can transform the input dataset. The experimental results show that TVCS has superior recognition accuracy than VCS and has better robustness against interference. The algorithm proposed is innovative as the data augmentation of text images, especially in a noisy environment.},

  abstract = {Multimodal MRI synthesis is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, particularly in glioma segmentation. However, cross-subject synthesis faces significant challenges due to the variability in brain structures and tumor morphology across individuals. Existing methods often fail to preserve tumor region fidelity, limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose the Tumor Representation Consistency Alignment Generative Adversarial Network (TRCA-GAN), a novel framework designed to enhance tumor region fidelity in cross-subject multimodal MRI synthesis. TRCA-GAN introduces two key innovations: the Region-Aware Perturbation Module (RAPM), which enhances tumor structure preservation through adaptive perturbation and joint attention mechanisms, and the Local Contrast Discriminator Module (LCDM), which improves tumor contrast fidelity via a dual physical-feature constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2021 dataset demonstrate that TRCA-GAN significantly outperforms comparison methods in terms of image generation quality and tumor segmentation accuracy. The results highlight the effectiveness of TRCA-GAN in addressing the challenges of cross-subject MRI synthesis, making it a powerful tool for clinical applications.},

  abstract = {In computer-based learning environments (CBLEs), adopting effective self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies requires sophisticated coordination of multiple SRL processes. While various studies have proposed adaptive SRL scaffolds (i.e. real-time advice on adopting effective SRL processes) and embedded them in CBLEs to facilitate learners’ effective use of SRL strategies, two key research gaps remain. First, there is a lack of research on SRL scaffolds that are based on continuous assessment of both learners’ SRL processes and learning conditions (e.g., awareness of learning resources) to provide adaptive support. Second, current analytics-based scaffolding mechanisms lack the scalability needed to effectively address multiple learning conditions. Integration of analytics of SRL with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can provide scalable scaffolding for real-time SRL processes and evolving conditions. Yet, empirical studies implementing and evaluating effects of this integration remain scarce. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized control trial, assigning participants to three groups (control, process only, and process with condition groups) to investigate the effects of using GenAI to turn insights from real-time analytics about students’ SRL processes and conditions into adaptive scaffolds. The results demonstrate that integrating real-time analytics with GenAI in adaptive SRL scaffolds – addressing both SRL processes and dynamic conditions – promotes more metacognitive learning patterns compared to the control and process-only groups. In addition, the learners showed varying levels of compliance with analytics-based GenAI scaffolds, and this was also reflected in how the learners coordinated their SRL processes, particularly in the performance phase of SRL. This study contributes to the literature by designing, implementing, and evaluating the impact of adaptive scaffolds on learners’ SRL processes using real-time analytics with GenAI.},

  abstract = {Over the past two years, generative AI (GenAI) has evolved rapidly, influencing interdisciplinary fields including social and e-commerce Recsys. Despite several exciting research advances, landing GenAI innovations in real-world Recsys remains challenging due to the sophistication of modern industrial product and systems. Our tutorial begins with a brief overview of industrial Recsys and GenAI fundamentals (including LLMOps), followed by the ongoing efforts and opportunities to enhance existing Recsys data and model with foundation models. We then explore how GenAI's curation and reasoning capabilities can be integrated into Recsys-for example, by repurposing raw content, incorporating external knowledge for display and creative optimization, and generating personalized insights/explanations to foster transparency and trust. Following this, the tutorial highlights how AI agents can reshape Recsys by introducing interactive reasoning and action loops, moving beyond traditional passive feedback models. Lastly, we shed insights on real-world solutions for human-AI alignment and responsible GenAI practices. A key feature of the tutorial is the presentation of the holistic AI, Infrastructure, LLMOps, and Product roadmap, including evaluation and responsible AI practices, based on production solutions from LinkedIn, Amazon, Meta, TikTok, Microsoft, and Instacart. Real-world case studies and demos are further provided for illustration. While GenRecsys is still in its early stages, this tutorial provides valuable insights and practical strategies for the Recsys and GenAI communities, bridging scientific research and applied solutions in this novel and rapidly growing field.},

In this study, we conducted a user-focused investigation to understand how AI-based content creation support tools are being adopted and perceived in South Korean broadcasting stations. We used the AI Editing Assistant, an AI-powered post-production support tool, as a research probe. Through in-depth interviews with 37 diverse participants—including directors, editors, producers, developers, and executives—we discovered that generative AI significantly enhances production efficiency and unlocks new creative possibilities. However, we identified challenges such as lack of user-centered approach, demanding nature of broadcasting workflows, and professionals’ low trust in AI technologies hinders widespread adoption. Based on our findings, we propose implications, considerations, and guidelines for integrating generative AI into broadcasting practices, emphasizing improved multi-stakeholder communication and collaboration for effective and sustainable AI adoption.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to changes in educational practices by creating opportunities for personalized learning and immediate support. Computer science student perceptions and behaviors towards GenAI tools have been studied, but the effects of such tools on student learning have yet to be determined conclusively. We investigate the impact of GenAI tools on computing students' performance in a database course and aim to understand why students use GenAI tools in assignments. Our mixed-methods study (N=226) asked students to self-report whether they used a GenAI tool to complete a part of an assignment and why. Our results reveal that students utilizing GenAI tools performed better on the assignment part in which LLMs were permitted but did worse in other parts of the assignment and in the course overall. Also, those who did not use GenAI tools viewed more discussion board posts and participated more than those who used ChatGPT. This suggests that using GenAI tools may not lead to better skill development or mental models, at least not if the use of such tools is unsupervised, and that engagement with official course help supports may be affected. Further, our thematic analysis of reasons for using or not using GenAI tools, helps understand why students are drawn to these tools. Shedding light into such aspects empowers instructors to be proactive in how to encourage, supervise, and handle the use or integration of GenAI into courses, fostering good learning habits.},

This study evaluates three different interaction modes (prompt-based, preset-based, and motif-based) of commercialized music AI toots with 17 participants of varying musical expertise to examine how prompt-based GenAI can improve creative intention. Our findings revealed that user groups preferred prompt-based music GenAI for distinct purposes: experts used it to validate musical concepts, novices to generate reference samples, and nonprofessionals to transform abstract ideas into musical compositions. We identified its potential for enhancing compositional efficiency and creativity through intuitive interaction, while also noting limitations in handling temporal and musical nuances solely through prompts.  Based on these insights, we present design guidelines to ensure users can effectively engage in the creative process, considering their musical expertise.},

  abstract = {The increasing complexity of AI systems has led to the growth of the field of Explainable AI (XAI), which aims to provide explanations and justifications for the outputs of AI algorithms. While there is considerable demand for XAI, there remains a scarcity of studies aimed at comprehensively understanding the practical distinctions among different methods and effectively aligning each method with users’ individual needs, and ideally, offer a mapping function which can map each user with its specific needs to a method of explainability. This study endeavors to bridge this gap by conducting a review of the relevant works in XAI, with a specific focus on Explainable Machine Learning (XML), and a keen eye on user needs to provide an observational study. Our main objective is to offer a classification of XAI methods within the realm of XML, categorizing current works into three distinct domains: philosophy, theory, and practice. Moreover, our study seeks to facilitate the connection between XAI users and the most suitable methods for them and tailor explanations to meet their specific needs by proposing a mapping function that take to account users and their desired properties and suggest an XAI method to them. This entails an examination of prevalent XAI approaches and an evaluation of their properties. The primary outcome of this study is the formulation of a clear and concise strategy for selecting the optimal XAI method to achieve a given goal, all while delivering personalized explanations tailored to individual users.},

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) based methods, especially deep learning methods, have shown promising performance in UOD. To further facilitate future advancements, we comprehensively study AI-based UOD. In this survey, we first categorise existing algorithms into traditional machine learning-based methods and deep learning-based methods, and summarise them by considering learning strategies, experimental datasets, learning stages, employed features or techniques, and underlying frameworks. Next, we discuss the potential challenges and suggest possible solutions and new directions. We also perform both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of mainstream algorithms across multiple benchmark datasets, taking into account the diversity and biases in experimental setups. Finally, we introduce two off-the-shelf detection analysis tools, Diagnosis and TIDE, which will examine the effects of object characteristics and various types of errors on detector performance. These tools help identify the strengths and weaknesses of different detectors, providing insights for further improvement. The source code, trained models, utilised datasets, detection results, and detection analysis tools are publicly available at  and will be regularly updated.},

These prompts allow the metaverse to interact with GenAI, where context information, instructions, input data, or even output indications constituting the prompt can come from within the metaverse. However, their integration poses challenges regarding interoperability, lack of standards, scalability, and maintaining a high-quality user experience. This article explores how GenAI can productively assist in enhancing creativity within the contexts of the metaverse and unlock new opportunities. We provide a technical, in-depth overview of the different generative models for image, video, audio, and 3D content within the metaverse environments. We also explore the bottlenecks, opportunities, and innovative applications of GenAI from the perspectives of end users, developers, service providers, and AI researchers. This survey commences by highlighting the potential of GenAI for enhancing the metaverse experience through dynamic content generation to populate massive virtual worlds. Subsequently, we shed light on the ongoing research practices and trends in multimodal content generation, enhancing realism and creativity and alleviating bottlenecks related to standardization, computational cost, privacy, and safety. Last, we share insights into promising research directions toward the integration of GenAI with the metaverse for creative enhancement, improved immersion, and innovative interactive applications.},

However, the task quality along with the student perspective on such generated tasks remains largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper introduces and evaluates a new feature of the so-called Tutor Kai for generating comprehensive programming tasks, including problem descriptions, code skeletons, unit tests, and model solutions. The presented system allows students to freely choose programming concepts and contextual themes for their tasks. To evaluate the system, we conducted a two-phase mixed-methods study comprising (1) an expert rating of 200 automatically generated programming tasks w.r.t. task quality, and (2) a study with 26 computer science students who solved and rated the personalized programming tasks. Results show that experts classified 89.5\% of the generated tasks as functional and 92.5\% as solvable. However, the system's rate for implementing all requested programming concepts decreased from 94\% for single-concept tasks to 40\% for tasks addressing three concepts. The student evaluation further revealed high satisfaction with the personalization. Students also reported perceived benefits for learning. The results imply that the new feature has the potential to offer students individual tasks aligned with their context and need for exercise. Tool developers, educators, and, above all, students can benefit from these insights and the system itself.},

This paper proposes an unsupervised method that combines edge detection and feature fusion to solve the above problems. Firstly, three layers of image features are extracted by the feature pyramid; secondly, the edge detection module extracts the edge features of the input image and feature map; then, the features are fused by adaptive feature fusion and attentional feature fusion; finally, correlation is computed layer-by-layer using the fused features to estimate the homography. In this paper, experiments have been conducted to verify the method's effectiveness by calculating the PSNR and SSIM metrics. Experimental results show that this method can estimate homography more accurately than other related methods when stitching large baseline images.},

  abstract = {Most of the attention on GenAI in computing education has focused on programming-centric tasks, such as code generation, giving feedback on code, or providing synthetic programming partners. Yet in advanced software engineering and project courses, interpersonal skills such as team meetings or customer interviews are equally important but difficult and instructor-intensive to teach realistically. GenAI presents the possibility of scaffolding the teaching of some of these practices by enabling exercises in which students develop the ability to investigate a topic by iteratively asking questions to find a solution. The goal is to create scenarios in which students train to interact with humans in real-world situations, simulating these interactions in a controlled, guided environment. These simulations could help students practice and refine ''soft skills,'' such as teamwork and interviewing, by mimicking the types of exchanges and problem-solving they would encounter in professional environments. This approach allows learners to engage in realistic communication exercises, improving their ability to handle complex, interpersonal tasks through repeated practice with AI-guided feedback. As an example, we envision examples that include requirements elicitation with customers, development team meetings, and discussion with potential investors, to name just a few.},

  abstract = {Active Learning approaches have found success in CS1 and CS2 courses, consolidating instructional time on the practical, problem-solving aspects of programming. With the increasing availability of generative Artificial Intelligence Assistants, there is a renewed push to focus on higher-order skills beyond syntax and solving programming problems by matching sample outputs.This poster examines the impact of conceptual explanation-based exercises in introductory programming courses through the implementation of a scaffolded semi-flipped classroom. This method is currently in its third semester as a part of an ongoing, iterative, semi-experimental approach to support student resilience in entrance-level courses. This approach aimed to enhance student engagement, retention, and performance by integrating weekly practice sessions and "group-tutoring" sessions facilitated by peer learning assistants. In these sessions, students were encouraged to articulate their problem-solving strategies and the reasoning behind their solutions, fostering a deeper understanding of programming language paradigms and problem-solving techniques.The findings indicate that this method significantly increased classroom engagement, as students became more active participants in their learning journey. Retention rates improved as students became more confident in understanding and applying programming concepts. Overall, student performance saw a notable rise, with students demonstrating a better grasp of programming paradigms and problem-solving approaches beyond rote memorization and matching sample outputs.},

  abstract = {Most current generative models for anomaly detection, which rely on reconstruction methods, primarily use either Variational Autoencoders or Generative Adversarial Networks. However, VAEs tend to suffer from poor reconstruction quality, while GANs face challenges related to training stability and limited pattern coverage. Additionally, due to privacy and security concerns, the available training data for anomaly detection is often limited, whereas generative models typically require large datasets to avoid the risk of overfitting. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection model utilizing diffusion techniques, designed specifically for tabular data, using a reconstruction-based approach. We adopt the diffusion model as the backbone for anomaly detection, aiming to enhance reconstruction quality and ensure training stability. To further improve reconstruction quality and accelerate inference, we employ a truncated diffusion strategy during inference. What's more, to overcome the challenge of insufficient training data, we introduce a SMOTE-based data augmentation method optimized for feature space in tabular data, incorporating a VAE to address the limitations of the original SMOTE algorithm in capturing complex data structures and handling nonlinear relationships. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate that our method achieves higher detection accuracy compared to conventional methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

  abstract = {The adoption of learning analytics (LA) and artificial intelligence (AI) in education has long been a challenge, in part due to the ethical issues it engenders (e.g., the alignment of technology-embedded and human stakeholder values). Value-sensitive design (VSD) is a human-centered and theory-grounded approach to technology design that explicitly elicits and accounts for human values. However, there is scant concrete guidance on how to involve students in co-designing LA technologies from a VSD perspective, in an efficient manner. This paper presents a novel method, called VALA/AID, to elicit student values, challenges and motivations, in the early stages of an LA design process. We briefly illustrate the application of the method and the kind of evidence and design insights that can be distilled from it, for a relatively under-explored context in LA research: doctoral education.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence holds significant potential to transform public administration by streamlining complex processes and improving service delivery. However, its adoption is hindered by concerns regarding its alignment with public values e.g., ensuring that all citizens are treated equitably. This study addresses these challenges through a value-driven design approach, focusing on a generative chatbot to assist citizens with the Housing Entitlement Certificate application, a service enabling low-income households to access subsidized housing in Germany. Through two participatory workshops with citizens and public administration employees, the research highlights a tension between significant benefits, such as improved accessibility and streamlined processes, and challenges, including reduced human interaction and dependency on technology. To navigate these tensions, the study proposes actionable requirements, including escalation pathways to human representatives and robust data protection measures. By providing a real-world example, this work illustrates how value-based design can guide the responsible and impactful integration of AI in public administration. The findings underscore the importance of balancing the potential of generative chatbots with societal and ethical considerations, offering a replicable framework for aligning AI systems with public values in diverse service contexts.},

  abstract = {The first typical generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) model ChatGpt 1 was introduced in 2018, but has not drawn much attention until the release of ChatGpt 3 in 2022. Since then, researchers and educators have been experimenting with Gen AI tools to explore their possibilities in various fields. In education, the use of Gen AI in assessment is a research focus. To reveal the research patterns in this field, the study employed Vosviewer and CiteSpace to analyze 816 papers in the Web of Science (WOS) database published between 2019 and 2024. The annual publications surged during the period of 2023-2024 due to the release of higher versions of Gen AI tools such as ChatGpt 3. Researchers in the United States, United Kingdom and China engage most actively in the field. American and Hong Kong universities are particularly productive. However, the collaboration between institutions and authors still needs to be enhanced. Highly influential journals such as Nature and famous medical journals such as JMIR Medical Education and Cureus Journal of Medical sciences are most frequently cited. The analysis of co-occurrence keywords and keyword clusters identified two research areas: responding to the academic integrity issue with the use of Gen AI in assessment and exploring the valuable use of Gen AI in assessments in higher education especially medical education. Future research could explore the design of innovative or alternative assessments and the use of Gen AI tools in interactive and game-based assessment creation, marking and feedback giving.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an Android certificate validation vulnerability detection framework that integrates static analysis, adversarial sample training, and optimization via large language models. Centered around the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network, the framework aims to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of static detection models against complex and obfuscated attack patterns. Static analysis is performed on 2,000 popular Android applications from the androzoo dataset, with code and configuration features extracted, focusing on certificate-related API usage, permission declarations, and network security settings. Among them, 110 APKs are identified as containing high-risk certificate misconfigurations. Based on these features, a Transformer-based model is constructed for feature vectorization and vulnerability identification. To further improve model robustness, WGAN is employed to generate adversarial samples that mimic real-world evasive vulnerabilities, which are used for adversarial training. Additionally, large language models are used to perform In-Context Learning, enabling semantic filtering, sample refinement, and iterative generator feedback. This results in a closed-loop, self-improving detection pipeline that combines detection, optimization, and feedback. Experimental results across standard, adversarial, and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves an F1 score of 0.91 and reduces the false positive rate to 7.2\%, significantly outperforming traditional static detection tools in both accuracy and resilience.},

  abstract = {While educational researchers in various disciplines are grappling with how to develop policies and pedagogical approaches that address the use of generative artificial intelligence, the challenge is particularly complex in computer science education where the new technology is changing the core of the field. In this paper, we take a look at the pedagogy of other subjects with a longer history than computer science and a more extensive body of educational research to collect insights on how this challenge can be met. We begin by drawing from recent neurological research to find domains that share cognitive commonalities with computer programming and then build upon comparisons that others have made to literacy and mathematics education. We then consider how the "reading wars" and "math wars" have shaped these fields, which we see as conflicts between less effective top-down pedagogy and more effective bottom-up pedagogy, and reflect on what would be comparable approaches in teaching computing. We find that approaches that make heavy use of large language models without teaching fundamentals can be compared to the top-down pedagogy of reading and mathematics and are likely to be ineffective on their own. Therefore, we advise against the exclusive use of such approaches with novices. However, we also acknowledge that the social science surrounding computer science education is complex and that effectiveness only tells a part of the story, with other factors such as engagement, motivation and social dynamics also being important.},

We describe our research with 21 developers at the cutting edge of using AI, summarizing 12 of their work goals we uncovered, together with 75 associated tasks and the skills \&amp; knowledge for each, illustrating how developers use AI at work. From all of these, we distilled our findings in the form of 5 insights. We found that the skills \&amp; knowledge to be a successful AI-enhanced developer are organized into four domains (using Generative AI effectively, core software engineering, adjacent engineering, and adjacent non-engineering) deployed at critical junctures throughout a 6-step task workflow. In order to "future proof" developers for this age of AI, on-the-job learning initiatives and computer science degree programs will need to target both "soft" skills and the technical skills \&amp; knowledge in all four domains to reskill, upskill and safeguard against deskilling.},

  abstract = {This study explores primary school children's ideas and curiosity about artificial intelligence (AI) using a combination of semi-structured interviews, a seek-and-find drawing task, and self-generated questions. The findings reveal six perspectives on AI, highlighting children's conceptions of AI as both a human-like entity with emotional and cognitive traits and a technological tool integrated into their daily lives. Their self-generated questions demonstrate curiosity about the practical, ethical, and philosophical dimensions of AI, often drawing parallels to human learning and interactions. By addressing a research gap in early AI education, this study provides insights for designing age-appropriate AI curricula that build on children's pre-instructional conceptions, fostering foundational understanding and equitable access to AI education.},

  abstract = {What if everyday technologies were designed for productivity and learning? This is critical in the era of generative artificial intelligence and pervasive digital technologies, where technology design substantially shapes what and how humans are learning. This paper introduces “support for learning” as an explicit design goal for everyday technologies. To provide background, we first differentiate four relationships between learning and technology: (1) learning to use technology, (2) learning about technology, (3) learning as a primary design goal, and (4) learning through technology. Designers can intentionally facilitate the latter (a) by following established design principles for usability and user experience, but need to go beyond such known ground by (b) identifying potential learning goals, and (c) connecting to high-quality learning resources and technology designed from within the system. A future research agenda should investigate the relationships between patterns of technology design, patterns of technology use, and learning.},

  abstract = {The systematic testing of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models by collaborative teams and distributed individuals, often called red-teaming, is a core part of the infrastructure that ensures that AI models do not produce harmful content. Unlike past technologies, the black box nature of generative AI systems necessitates a uniquely interactional mode of testing, one in which individuals on red teams actively interact with the system, leveraging natural language to simulate malicious actors and solicit harmful outputs. This interactional labor done by red teams can result in mental health harms that are uniquely tied to the adversarial engagement strategies necessary to effectively red team. The importance of ensuring that generative AI models do not propagate societal or individual harm is widely recognized—one less visible foundation of end-to-end AI safety is also the protection of the mental health and wellbeing of those who work to keep model outputs safe. In this paper, we argue that the unmet mental health needs of AI red-teamers are a critical workplace safety concern. Through analyzing the unique mental health impacts associated with the labor done by red teams, we propose potential individual and organizational strategies that could be used to meet these needs, and safeguard the mental health of red-teamers. We develop our proposed strategies through drawing parallels between common red-teaming practices and interactional labor common to other professions (including actors, mental health professionals, conflict photographers, and content moderators), describing how individuals and organizations within these professional spaces safeguard their mental health given similar psychological demands. Drawing on these protective practices, we describe how safeguards could be adapted for the distinct mental health challenges experienced by red teaming organizations as they mitigate emerging technological risks on the new digital frontlines. Note: This work includes descriptions of violence, trauma, and mental illness.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice-Conversion (VC) using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have made it possible to generate high-quality and realistic human-like audio. This introduces significant challenges to distinguishing AI-synthesized speech from the authentic human voice and could raise potential issues of misuse for malicious purposes such as impersonation and fraud, spreading misinformation, deepfakes, and scams. However, existing detection techniques for AI-synthesized audio have not kept pace and often exhibit poor generalization across diverse datasets. In this article, we introduce SONAR, a synthetic AI-Audio Detection Framework and Benchmark, aiming at providing a comprehensive evaluation for distinguishing cutting-edge AI-synthesized auditory content. SONAR includes a novel evaluation dataset sourced from 9 diverse audio synthesis platforms, including leading TTS providers and state-of-the-art TTS models. It is the first framework to uniformly benchmark AI-audio detection across both traditional and foundation model-based deepfake detection systems. Through extensive experiments, (1) we reveal the generalization limitations of existing detection methods and demonstrate that foundation models exhibit stronger generalization capabilities, which can be attributed to their model size and the scale and quality of pretraining data. (2) Our evaluation of the generalization across languages suggests that speech foundation models demonstrate robust cross-lingual generalization capabilities, maintaining strong performance across diverse languages despite being fine-tuned solely on English speech data. This finding also suggests that the primary challenges in audio deepfake detection are more closely tied to the realism and quality of synthetic audio rather than language-specific characteristics. (3) We also explore the effectiveness and efficiency of few-shot fine-tuning in improving generalization, highlighting its potential for tailored applications, such as personalized detection systems for specific entities or individuals.

While the European Union is currently leading the way with its AI Act, many other legislators will follow and already positioned themselves with white papers and other publications. This commentary argues that “Artificial Intelligence”, including Generative AI, should not be used as a regulatory category. Not because there is no potential for harm from AI systems and not because AI systems should not be regulated, but because “Artificial Intelligence” is a vaguely defined label that is neither suitable nor necessary for comprehensive regulation of technological risks. Instead of regulating a particular set of approaches and algorithms, lawmakers should focus and double down on regulating high-risk applications of software, independent of whether it is labelled as AI or not.},
