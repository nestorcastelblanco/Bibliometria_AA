abstract = {Graphs, which encode pairwise relations between entities, serve as a fundamental data structure across real-world domains. Many critical applications can be formulated as graph-based tasks, and graph machine learning (GML), from the shallow embedding models to graph neural networks and further advanced to the most powerful graph transformers, has been well-established to automate knowledge discovery and decision-making on graphs. In parallel, the recent emergence of large foundational models has driven machine learning into a new era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), and this revolution presents both unprecedented opportunities and profound challenges for the well-established GML paradigms. However, few investigations have analyzed and envisioned how GML should evolve to harness these opportunities, address these challenges, and embrace this new Gen-AI era. To fill in this gap, we organize the first international Workshop on Machine Learning on Graphs in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (MLoG-GenAI), held in connection with the 31st ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, which provides a venue to gather academic researchers and industry practitioners to discuss and picture the development of GML in the new Gen-AI era.},

However, it remains underexplored how GenAI chatbots influence visitors’ in-field experience and interaction at art museums regarding finding information, engagement, and enjoyment compared to existing museum tour-guide applications. In this paper, we contribute the design and implementation of a smartphone-based chatbot that detects artwork, generates textual and auditory information, and interactively answers visitors’ questions. To explore visitors’ experience with it, we conducted a field experiment (N=30) at the National Art Museum, comparing it to the existing museum application. Our results indicate that visitors showed higher artwork engagement with the chatbot than the museum application. Moreover, they enjoyed an interactive experience using the chatbot to learn about the art collection and have equally preferred textual and auditory information representation.},

abstract = {This study analyzed how students used generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools in collaborative problem solving. We examined students’ GAI usage using conversational data and screen recordings from 12 groups, each comprising three university students. A coding framework was developed through hybrid thematic analysis to capture students’ GAI use behaviors at both individual and group levels. Four types of behaviors were identified: prompting, information sharing, information use, and evaluation. Based on this framework, we conducted a correlation analysis to examine how these behaviors were related to students’ knowledge construction. The results showed that GAI use behaviors involving sharing or comparing responses were correlated with lower levels of knowledge construction, whereas behaviors involving co-editing and evaluating were correlated with higher levels. This study contributes a new framework for analyzing individual and collective use of GAI in collaborative learning and offers pedagogical insights that guide students’ effective use of GAI tools in teaching practice.},

abstract = {It has recently emerged that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly developed and can create realistic speech, images, and video. Although such innovations provide many advantages, they pose major threats to the network's security. The research question of the study will, therefore, be the role and effects of generative artificial intelligence on network security, especially deepfake, artificial intelligence-driven phishing, and multimedia content manipulation. This research uses a case study analysis of real-life experiences of security threats in networked systems to show how generative AI can be misused. The findings reveal that: 1. Generative AI can create highly developed cyberattacks such as deepfake social engineering and AI-supplemented phishing, which use visually and audibly persuasive appeals to manipulate users. 2. The problem with this kind of security threat highlighted by AI is that most traditional security solutions lack awareness of such threats since they are incapable of effective real-time user authentication, over-dependence on visual and biometric verification, and lack of AI-awareness training. 3. There are significant gaps in cybersecurity policies and training. Many organizations lack formal protocols for addressing AI-related security risks, and often, organizations are applying generative AI technologies. In addressing the aforementioned vulnerabilities, the study recommends an improved security model that incorporates deepfake detection, more secure authentication, and even advanced anomaly detection systems. In furtherance, there should be improvements in policy that aim at commanding the AI media, ensuring comprehensive training of the employees on cybersecurity matters, and drives that aim at educating the public on how to enhance the strength for discouraging AI cybercrimes.},

There has been a recent rise in the usage and popularity of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), such as ChatGPT especially with its ability to mimic human behavior. In this study, we demonstrate a novel application of GenAI for epidemic modeling. We employed GenAI for creating agents living in a hypothetical town in simulations and simulating their behavior within the context of an ongoing pandemic. We performed a series of simulations to quantify the impact of agent traits and the availability of information for health condition, virus, and government guidelines on the disease spread patterns in terms of peak time and epidemic duration. We also characterized the most influential factors in agents' decision-making using random forest model.},

The purpose of this paper is to derive significant behavioral sequence characteristics by coding and recording the actual video of generative artificial intelligence classrooms and analyzing the classroom interaction behaviors using lag sequence analysis. The study shows that the teacher-student interaction in the generative artificial intelligence classroom is more active, and the students' active participation in the classroom is very high, which will further promote the generative artificial intelligence classroom and realize the deep integration of the new technology and the classroom.},

We assessed the ability of GAI, specifically the GPT class of models, at automatically coding discourse in the context of a learning analytics study using a variety of prompting and training strategies. We found that fine-tuning approaches produced the best results; however, no results achieved standard thresholds for reliability in our field.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems bring innovative ways of information provision and knowledge delivery. In the public sector, generative AI has the potential to decrease bureaucratic discretion in the decision-making process. Increasing reliance on this technology brings challenges of unfair treatment, colonized responses from the system, and data governance. Because of historical interaction, tribal communities are the most underrepresented in policy planning and implementation. Indigenous communities suffer from the neglect of tribal sovereignty by the U.S. federal government and limited accessibility and literacy in the digital world. Generative AI systems exacerbate these challenges with insufficient tribal input. However, the negative impact can be alleviated with digital equity and knowledge cocreation. Digital equity emphasizes the importance of tribal knowledge representation, and knowledge cocreation focuses on the collaboration between Indigenous communities and relevant actors in data governance for generative AI systems. This study proposes two research questions to discuss tribal knowledge cocreation in generative AI systems: (1) what are the biases in the system responses from the tribal perspective? (2) what are the potential resolutions for these problems? The findings from in-depth interviews with tribal members in the U.S. indicate that the insufficient articulation of tribal culture, the lack of crucial tribal historical events, and the inappropriate appellation of tribal nations are the primary drawbacks in the system responses. From the Indigenous perspective, tribal oral traditions, native publications and documents, and collaboration with tribal governments can address the problems of generative AI responses. This study contributes to the theory development of digital equity and knowledge cocreation in tribal generative AI system responses. Policy recommendations and future research agendas are included in this research.},

abstract = {The utilization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek is bringing about significant changes in educational practices and learning environments. This alteration underlines the necessity to look into how AI can enhance ethics education for the youth. This research reveals that the capabilities of GAI match up well with the requirements of youth ethics education in four principal ways: (1) crafting immersive, multi-sensory scenarios to boost student interest. By creating such scenarios, students can get more engaged and excited about learning. (2) Employing adaptive methods for precise interventions. This means being able to adjust the teaching approach according to each student's specific situation to make the intervention more effective. (3) Generating personalized content to customize the delivery of knowledge. Every student is different, and personalized content can better meet their individual learning needs. (4) Offering real-time analysis to improve teaching methods. With real-time analysis, teachers can quickly understand how students are doing and make timely adjustments. Based on these connections, this study puts forward a framework that incorporates GAI into crucial parts of the teaching process: integrating comprehensive learning data. This helps to have a more complete understanding of students' learning progress. Developing evidence-based strategies. So that teaching decisions are made with solid evidence. Creating differentiated content. To cater to the diverse needs of students. And assessing outcomes in multiple dimensions. This integration not only enhances the efficiency of moral education but also provides a scalable model for applying AI-driven teaching innovations across different subjects.},

abstract = {In the field of education, generative artificial intelligence is gradually becoming a key force to promote educational innovation and intelligent development. This technology simulates the process of human creation, generates innovative and practical teaching content, and provides a strong technical support for personalized teaching. For rural education with relatively scarce resources, the application of generative artificial intelligence is expected to solve the problem of educational inequity and improve the quality of teaching. However, rural education still faces many challenges, such as resource shortage and information block, which limit the effective application of generative artificial intelligence in rural education. This study deeply analyzes the application status and advantages of generative artificial intelligence in rural teaching, reveals the main problems and difficulties encountered by rural teachers in the process of use, and puts forward targeted solutions, in order to promote the optimal application of generative artificial intelligence in rural education and promote the development of rural education in a fairer and smarter direction.},

abstract = {Context-aware AR instruction enables adaptive and in-situ learning experiences. However, hardware limitations and expertise requirements constrain the creation of such instructions. With recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), current research tries to tackle these constraints by deploying AI-generated content (AIGC) in AR applications. However, our preliminary study with six AR practitioners revealed that the current AIGC lacks contextual information to adapt to varying application scenarios and is therefore limited in authoring. To utilize the strong generative power of GenAI to ease the authoring of AR instruction while capturing the context, we developed CARING-AI, an AR system to author context-aware humanoid-avatar-based instructions with GenAI. By navigating in the environment, users naturally provide contextual information to generate humanoid-avatar animation as AR instructions that blend in the context spatially and temporally. We showcased three application scenarios of CARING-AI: Asynchronous Instructions, Remote Instructions, and Ad Hoc Instructions based on a design space of AIGC in AR Instructions. With two user studies (N=12), we assessed the system usability of CARING-AI and demonstrated the easiness and effectiveness of authoring with Gen-AI.},

abstract = {Context: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more recently, the dissemination of Copilot, ChatGPT-3 and similar tools have broadened the discussion about the possibility of using generative AI tools in many professional segments such as health, education, and technological area. Problem: Although some studies explore the potential of generative AI tools to assist Information Technology (IT) professionals in executing specific tasks, they do not delve into the professionals’ characteristics or collect information about multiple generative AI tools usage. Solution: Considering the possibilities brought by generative AI, this study aims to shed light on the perception of IT professionals about generative AI tools and characterize these professionals’ profiles. IS Theory: This research is based on the Technology Acceptance Model. Method: A survey research was carried out with IT professionals so as to identify how these professionals are using generative AI and gather information about these professionals’ profiles. Results: Results show that 70,5\% (43 out of 61) of the respondents use some generative AI tool, the majority of whom are software development professionals, and, despite the problems faced when using these tools, 86\% of these professionals recommend using them. Contribution: In this study the profile of the IT professionals using generative AI was identified, it was then possible to evaluate the acceptance of such tools among these professionals and identify the main reasons why some of them are not yet using generative AI.},

The development of international Chinese education also requires the digitalization and intelligence of international Chinese teaching resources. In this regard, this article utilizes the technology of ChatGPT platform to integrate teaching resources, constructs an artificial intelligence teaching resource generation framework consisting of demand analysis, intelligent generation, and quality assessment modules, as well as a quality evolution model of artificial intelligence international Chinese teaching resources. Based on this framework and resource quality evolution model, an experiment on the generation of artificial intelligence teaching resources was carried out, and inspections and evaluations were conducted from the perspectives of natural language processing technology, learners, and teachers. The results show that the teaching resources generated by artificial intelligence pass the inspection of natural language understanding technology and have good quality; learners and teachers are optimistic about the application of teaching resources in teaching and believe that most of these resources have reached a usable state; learners' overall experience in using teaching resources is positive and they believe that these resources can promote learning in many aspects. The application of artificial intelligence in generating teaching resources in this article helps to optimize the construction mode of international Chinese teaching resources and promote the high-quality development of international Chinese education.},

How does GenAI impact User Experience Design (UXD) practice, and are fears warranted? We interviewed 20 UX Designers, with diverse experience and across companies (startups to large enterprises). We probed them to characterize their practices, and sample their attitudes, concerns, and expectations. We found that experienced designers are confident in their originality, creativity, and empathic skills, and find GenAI’s role as assistive. They emphasized the unique human factors of “enjoyment” and “agency”, where humans remain the arbiters of “AI alignment’’. However, skill degradation, job replacement, and creativity exhaustion can adversely impact junior designers. We discuss implications for human-GenAI collaboration, specifically copyright and ownership, human creativity and agency, and AI literacy and access. Through the lens of responsible and participatory AI, we contribute a deeper understanding of GenAI fears and opportunities for UXD.},

While recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI (generative artificial intelligence)) enable automated generation of landscape renderings, the End to End (endtoend) methods are not compatible with common design processes, leading to insufficient alignment with design idealizations and limited cohesion of iterative landscape design. Informed by a formative study for comprehending design requirements, we present PlantoGraphy, an iterative design system that allows for interactive configuration of generative artificial intelligence models to accommodate human-centered design practice. A two-stage pipeline is incorporated: first, the concretization module transforms conceptual ideas into concrete scene layouts with a domain-oriented large language model; and second, the illustration module converts scene layouts into realistic landscape renderings with a layout-guided diffusion model Fine-tune (finetune)ed through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (lora). PlantoGraphy has undergone a series of performance evaluations and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in landscape rendering generation and the high recognition of its interactive functionality.},

In this paper, we construct the ‘AIGC-DRIVE’ dynamic closed-loop model to explain the role of AIGC in the innovation of platform economy content production and marketing strategy, and carry out efficiency comparison, AB test of AIGC advertisement strategy, and research on users' privacy concerns, as well as combining with the typical case studies of Jitterbug and SHEIN. It is found that AIGC can greatly improve the production efficiency and support the real-time optimisation of dynamic marketing strategies through data-driven multimodal content generation; however, the application of the technology faces the risks of content homogenisation, algorithmic black-boxing and user privacy leakage. This paper proposes a synergistic mechanism of ‘technology embedding - institutional constraints - user feedback’ to achieve sustainable development, which provides a theoretical basis and a practical path for the design of the governance framework of AIGC in the platform economy.},

abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has created a level of chaos in higher education as both students and faculty try to determine its utility and how best to incorporate it into the learning process. Students may view generative AI as a means to an end of achieving a perfect grade, skipping important elements of the learning process, or they may view it as an opportunity to expand their creative efforts. Faculty may view it as a tool students use to circumvent plagiarism detection, may feel it potentially minimizes the role of faculty in the classroom, or they may view it as an opportunity to avail of a supplement to existing activities and assignments. Ultimately, faculty are faced with maintaining academic integrity and reinforcing the need and importance of the learning process. This paper explores the combination of three approaches: peer-supported incremental learning, master/apprentice model, and growth mindset as a way for faculty to guide appropriate student use of generative AI, while also maintaining the integrity of the learning process.},

abstract = {Written feedback has long been a cornerstone in educational and professional settings, essential for enhancing learning outcomes. However, multimodal feedback-integrating textual, auditory, and visual cues-promises a more engaging and effective learning experience. By leveraging multiple sensory channels, multimodal feedback better accommodates diverse learning preferences and aids in deeper information retention. Despite its potential, creating multimodal feedback poses challenges, including the need for increased time and resources. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offer solutions to automate the feedback process, predominantly focusing on textual feedback. Yet, the application of GenAI in generating multimodal feedback remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates the use of GenAI techniques to generate multimodal feedback, aiming to provide this feedback for large cohorts of learners, thereby enhancing learning experience and engagement. By exploring the potential of GenAI for this purpose, we propose a framework for automating the generation of multimodal feedback, which we name MuFIN.},

abstract = {Generative AI models have revolutionized intelligent systems by enabling machines to produce human-like content across diverse domains. However, their outputs often exhibit unpredictability due to complex and opaque internal semantic states, posing challenges for reliability in real-world applications. In this article, we introduce the AI Uncertainty Principle, a novel theoretical framework inspired by quantum mechanics, to model and quantify the inherent unpredictability in generative AI outputs. By drawing parallels with the uncertainty principle and superposition, we formalize the tradeoff between the precision of internal semantic states and output variability. Through comprehensive experiments involving state-of-the-art models and a variety of prompt designs, we analyze how factors such as specificity, complexity, tone, and style influence model behavior. Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts can significantly enhance output predictability and consistency, while excessive complexity or irrelevant information can increase uncertainty. We also show that ensemble techniques, such as Sigma-weighted aggregation across models and prompt variations, effectively improve reliability. Our findings have profound implications for the development of intelligent systems, emphasizing the critical role of prompt engineering and theoretical modeling in creating AI technologies that perceive, reason, and act predictably in the real world.},

abstract = {Mathematical stories have demonstrated the ability to bolster the motivation and interest of students in learning mathematics, thereby exerting a positive influence on their academic performance. However, due to a lack of adequate resources and the desire to engage students in the creation process, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is utilized to generate mathematical stories accompanied by images. This study presents a framework for automatic quality assessment to evaluate the coherence of multimodal text and images generated by GAI, as well as the appropriateness of the stories for different grade levels. The dataset comprises mathematical stories generated by GAI for grades 3, 4, and 5, obtained from an American online learning platform, each story consisting of titles, bodies, and image illustrations generated by GP4, images generated by DALL-E3. Initially, a method is devised based on CLIP model and Mini-GPT4 for extracting multimodal semantic features to establish the relationship between text and images in mathematical stories and their generation parameters. Subsequently, mathematical text features are designed, including nine mathematical text attributes and ten traditional text readability indicators, followed by collinearity feature selection and statistical testing. Finally, five machine learning grade regressor for mathematical stories were trained, and the correlation between these 19 features and grades is explored using genetic algorithm-based factor mining and the interpretable artificial intelligence method SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To further understand advanced text features, the latest natural language processing (NLP) readability indicators are also integrated into the analysis. Through multimodal features, traditional text readability metrics, and NLP readability indicators, this method introduces a novel approach for automatically assessing the quality of GAI-generated multimodal mathematical stories, providing a tool for grade predictor and shedding light on the factors (Image-text relevance and textual features) influencing the grade level of analyzed stories, thereby offering new insights for leveraging GAI in mathematical education.},

While there is an increasing interest in the adoption of GAI systems, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, there are also serious concerns about the copyright of the contents—the inputs or generated as outputs by the GAI systems. Such concerns need to be identified and assessed to ensure the ethical and responsible use of GAI systems. Thus, this article aims to address the key research challenge: “how to identify and assess GAI system's copyright concerns”? In response, we propose the development of a Copyright Risk Checker (CRC) Tool. This tool has been formulated and evaluated using a recognised design science research methodology, drawing on an analysis of 10 legal cases across Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. The CRC Tool has undergone evaluation through an experimental scenario, and the results suggest that it is suitable for conducting an indicative copyright risk check of GAI systems. The outcomes of this preliminary assessment can be further examined by expert legal advisors for an in-depth analysis. The development of the CRC Tool provides a foundation for continued research and advancement in this significant area of study.},

Data was collected from Finnish high school students to represent how key constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model—Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Enjoyment, and Intention to Use—influence the adoption of AI tools. First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness.

abstract = {Graphs, which encode pairwise relations between entities, serve as a fundamental data structure across real-world domains. Many critical applications can be formulated as graph-based tasks, and graph machine learning (GML), from the shallow embedding models to graph neural networks and further advanced to the most powerful graph transformers, has been well-established to automate knowledge discovery and decision-making on graphs. In parallel, the recent emergence of large foundational models has driven machine learning into a new era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), and this revolution presents both unprecedented opportunities and profound challenges for the well-established GML paradigms. However, few investigations have analyzed and envisioned how GML should evolve to harness these opportunities, address these challenges, and embrace this new Gen-AI era. To fill in this gap, we organize the first international Workshop on Machine Learning on Graphs in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (MLoG-GenAI), held in connection with the 31st ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, which provides a venue to gather academic researchers and industry practitioners to discuss and picture the development of GML in the new Gen-AI era.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) chatbots start changing experiences with art for museum visitors by making them more interactive and engaging. However, it remains underexplored how GenAI chatbots influence visitors’ in-field experience and interaction at art museums regarding finding information, engagement, and enjoyment compared to existing museum tour-guide applications. In this paper, we contribute the design and implementation of a smartphone-based chatbot that detects artwork, generates textual and auditory information, and interactively answers visitors’ questions. To explore visitors’ experience with it, we conducted a field experiment (N=30) at the National Art Museum, comparing it to the existing museum application. Our results indicate that visitors showed higher artwork engagement with the chatbot than the museum application. Moreover, they enjoyed an interactive experience using the chatbot to learn about the art collection and have equally preferred textual and auditory information representation.},

abstract = {This study analyzed how students used generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools in collaborative problem solving. We examined students’ GAI usage using conversational data and screen recordings from 12 groups, each comprising three university students. A coding framework was developed through hybrid thematic analysis to capture students’ GAI use behaviors at both individual and group levels. Four types of behaviors were identified: prompting, information sharing, information use, and evaluation. Based on this framework, we conducted a correlation analysis to examine how these behaviors were related to students’ knowledge construction. The results showed that GAI use behaviors involving sharing or comparing responses were correlated with lower levels of knowledge construction, whereas behaviors involving co-editing and evaluating were correlated with higher levels. This study contributes a new framework for analyzing individual and collective use of GAI in collaborative learning and offers pedagogical insights that guide students’ effective use of GAI tools in teaching practice.},

abstract = {It has recently emerged that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly developed and can create realistic speech, images, and video. Although such innovations provide many advantages, they pose major threats to the network's security. The research question of the study will, therefore, be the role and effects of generative artificial intelligence on network security, especially deepfake, artificial intelligence-driven phishing, and multimedia content manipulation. This research uses a case study analysis of real-life experiences of security threats in networked systems to show how generative AI can be misused. The findings reveal that: 1. Generative AI can create highly developed cyberattacks such as deepfake social engineering and AI-supplemented phishing, which use visually and audibly persuasive appeals to manipulate users. 2. The problem with this kind of security threat highlighted by AI is that most traditional security solutions lack awareness of such threats since they are incapable of effective real-time user authentication, over-dependence on visual and biometric verification, and lack of AI-awareness training. 3. There are significant gaps in cybersecurity policies and training. Many organizations lack formal protocols for addressing AI-related security risks, and often, organizations are applying generative AI technologies. In addressing the aforementioned vulnerabilities, the study recommends an improved security model that incorporates deepfake detection, more secure authentication, and even advanced anomaly detection systems. In furtherance, there should be improvements in policy that aim at commanding the AI media, ensuring comprehensive training of the employees on cybersecurity matters, and drives that aim at educating the public on how to enhance the strength for discouraging AI cybercrimes.},

There has been a recent rise in the usage and popularity of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), such as ChatGPT especially with its ability to mimic human behavior. In this study, we demonstrate a novel application of GenAI for epidemic modeling. We employed GenAI for creating agents living in a hypothetical town in simulations and simulating their behavior within the context of an ongoing pandemic. We performed a series of simulations to quantify the impact of agent traits and the availability of information for health condition, virus, and government guidelines on the disease spread patterns in terms of peak time and epidemic duration. We also characterized the most influential factors in agents' decision-making using random forest model.},

In order to comply with the development of technology, some classroom teaching also incorporates it to build a generative artificial intelligence classroom. The classroom interaction behavior has an important reference value to help teachers reconstruct the teaching design and reform the teaching mode. The purpose of this paper is to derive significant behavioral sequence characteristics by coding and recording the actual video of generative artificial intelligence classrooms and analyzing the classroom interaction behaviors using lag sequence analysis. The study shows that the teacher-student interaction in the generative artificial intelligence classroom is more active, and the students' active participation in the classroom is very high, which will further promote the generative artificial intelligence classroom and realize the deep integration of the new technology and the classroom.},

Manual coding can be time-consuming and error prone; automated coding can be difficult to implement for non-technical users. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) offers a user friendly alternative to automated discourse coding via prompting and APIs. We assessed the ability of GAI, specifically the GPT class of models, at automatically coding discourse in the context of a learning analytics study using a variety of prompting and training strategies. We found that fine-tuning approaches produced the best results; however, no results achieved standard thresholds for reliability in our field.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems bring innovative ways of information provision and knowledge delivery. In the public sector, generative AI has the potential to decrease bureaucratic discretion in the decision-making process. Increasing reliance on this technology brings challenges of unfair treatment, colonized responses from the system, and data governance. Because of historical interaction, tribal communities are the most underrepresented in policy planning and implementation. Indigenous communities suffer from the neglect of tribal sovereignty by the U.S. federal government and limited accessibility and literacy in the digital world. Generative AI systems exacerbate these challenges with insufficient tribal input. However, the negative impact can be alleviated with digital equity and knowledge cocreation. Digital equity emphasizes the importance of tribal knowledge representation, and knowledge cocreation focuses on the collaboration between Indigenous communities and relevant actors in data governance for generative AI systems. This study proposes two research questions to discuss tribal knowledge cocreation in generative AI systems: (1) what are the biases in the system responses from the tribal perspective? (2) what are the potential resolutions for these problems? The findings from in-depth interviews with tribal members in the U.S. indicate that the insufficient articulation of tribal culture, the lack of crucial tribal historical events, and the inappropriate appellation of tribal nations are the primary drawbacks in the system responses. From the Indigenous perspective, tribal oral traditions, native publications and documents, and collaboration with tribal governments can address the problems of generative AI responses. This study contributes to the theory development of digital equity and knowledge cocreation in tribal generative AI system responses. Policy recommendations and future research agendas are included in this research.},

abstract = {The utilization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek is bringing about significant changes in educational practices and learning environments. This alteration underlines the necessity to look into how AI can enhance ethics education for the youth. This research reveals that the capabilities of GAI match up well with the requirements of youth ethics education in four principal ways: (1) crafting immersive, multi-sensory scenarios to boost student interest. By creating such scenarios, students can get more engaged and excited about learning. (2) Employing adaptive methods for precise interventions. This means being able to adjust the teaching approach according to each student's specific situation to make the intervention more effective. (3) Generating personalized content to customize the delivery of knowledge. Every student is different, and personalized content can better meet their individual learning needs. (4) Offering real-time analysis to improve teaching methods. With real-time analysis, teachers can quickly understand how students are doing and make timely adjustments. Based on these connections, this study puts forward a framework that incorporates GAI into crucial parts of the teaching process: integrating comprehensive learning data. This helps to have a more complete understanding of students' learning progress. Developing evidence-based strategies. So that teaching decisions are made with solid evidence.

abstract = {In the field of education, generative artificial intelligence is gradually becoming a key force to promote educational innovation and intelligent development. This technology simulates the process of human creation, generates innovative and practical teaching content, and provides a strong technical support for personalized teaching. For rural education with relatively scarce resources, the application of generative artificial intelligence is expected to solve the problem of educational inequity and improve the quality of teaching. However, rural education still faces many challenges, such as resource shortage and information block, which limit the effective application of generative artificial intelligence in rural education. This study deeply analyzes the application status and advantages of generative artificial intelligence in rural teaching, reveals the main problems and difficulties encountered by rural teachers in the process of use, and puts forward targeted solutions, in order to promote the optimal application of generative artificial intelligence in rural education and promote the development of rural education in a fairer and smarter direction.},

abstract = {Context-aware AR instruction enables adaptive and in-situ learning experiences. However, hardware limitations and expertise requirements constrain the creation of such instructions. With recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), current research tries to tackle these constraints by deploying AI-generated content (AIGC) in AR applications. However, our preliminary study with six AR practitioners revealed that the current AIGC lacks contextual information to adapt to varying application scenarios and is therefore limited in authoring. To utilize the strong generative power of GenAI to ease the authoring of AR instruction while capturing the context, we developed CARING-AI, an AR system to author context-aware humanoid-avatar-based instructions with GenAI. By navigating in the environment, users naturally provide contextual information to generate humanoid-avatar animation as AR instructions that blend in the context spatially and temporally. We showcased three application scenarios of CARING-AI: Asynchronous Instructions, Remote Instructions, and Ad Hoc Instructions based on a design space of AIGC in AR Instructions. With two user studies (N=12), we assessed the system usability of CARING-AI and demonstrated the easiness and effectiveness of authoring with Gen-AI.},

abstract = {Context: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more recently, the dissemination of Copilot, ChatGPT-3 and similar tools have broadened the discussion about the possibility of using generative AI tools in many professional segments such as health, education, and technological area. Problem: Although some studies explore the potential of generative AI tools to assist Information Technology (IT) professionals in executing specific tasks, they do not delve into the professionals’ characteristics or collect information about multiple generative AI tools usage. Solution: Considering the possibilities brought by generative AI, this study aims to shed light on the perception of IT professionals about generative AI tools and characterize these professionals’ profiles. IS Theory: This research is based on the Technology Acceptance Model. Method: A survey research was carried out with IT professionals so as to identify how these professionals are using generative AI and gather information about these professionals’ profiles. Results: Results show that 70,5\% (43 out of 61) of the respondents use some generative AI tool, the majority of whom are software development professionals, and, despite the problems faced when using these tools, 86\% of these professionals recommend using them. Contribution: In this study the profile of the IT professionals using generative AI was identified, it was then possible to evaluate the acceptance of such tools among these professionals and identify the main reasons why some of them are not yet using generative AI.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence has set off a new round of intelligent revolution and promoted the reform and development of the education industry. The development of international Chinese education also requires the digitalization and intelligence of international Chinese teaching resources. In this regard, this article utilizes the technology of ChatGPT platform to integrate teaching resources, constructs an artificial intelligence teaching resource generation framework consisting of demand analysis, intelligent generation, and quality assessment modules, as well as a quality evolution model of artificial intelligence international Chinese teaching resources. Based on this framework and resource quality evolution model, an experiment on the generation of artificial intelligence teaching resources was carried out, and inspections and evaluations were conducted from the perspectives of natural language processing technology, learners, and teachers. The results show that the teaching resources generated by artificial intelligence pass the inspection of natural language understanding technology and have good quality; learners and teachers are optimistic about the application of teaching resources in teaching and believe that most of these resources have reached a usable state; learners' overall experience in using teaching resources is positive and they believe that these resources can promote learning in many aspects. The application of artificial intelligence in generating teaching resources in this article helps to optimize the construction mode of international Chinese teaching resources and promote the high-quality development of international Chinese education.},

abstract = {Among creative professionals, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has sparked excitement over its capabilities and fear over unanticipated consequences. How does GenAI impact User Experience Design (UXD) practice, and are fears warranted? We interviewed 20 UX Designers, with diverse experience and across companies (startups to large enterprises). We probed them to characterize their practices, and sample their attitudes, concerns, and expectations. We found that experienced designers are confident in their originality, creativity, and empathic skills, and find GenAI’s role as assistive. They emphasized the unique human factors of “enjoyment” and “agency”, where humans remain the arbiters of “AI alignment’’. However, skill degradation, job replacement, and creativity exhaustion can adversely impact junior designers. We discuss implications for human-GenAI collaboration, specifically copyright and ownership, human creativity and agency, and AI literacy and access. Through the lens of responsible and participatory AI, we contribute a deeper understanding of GenAI fears and opportunities for UXD.},

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) are disruptive technologies in the area of education. While online education brings significant advantages in enhancing educational quality, promoting educational equity, and improving educational efficiency, it has also raised concerns among scholars around the world regarding students' moral ethics, cultivation of emotional values, technological dependence, thinking deprivation, privacy, and policy making. Using Cite Space software to analyze more than 50 articles from core journals in the field of educational technology at home and abroad, this paper comprehensively summarizes the role and impact of generative AI in education up to 2023, suggests the limitations of generative AI in empowering education at present, and predicts the direction scholars will tend to research in this field in the future.},

While recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI (generative artificial intelligence)) enable automated generation of landscape renderings, the End to End (endtoend) methods are not compatible with common design processes, leading to insufficient alignment with design idealizations and limited cohesion of iterative landscape design. Informed by a formative study for comprehending design requirements, we present PlantoGraphy, an iterative design system that allows for interactive configuration of generative artificial intelligence models to accommodate human-centered design practice. A two-stage pipeline is incorporated: first, the concretization module transforms conceptual ideas into concrete scene layouts with a domain-oriented large language model; and second, the illustration module converts scene layouts into realistic landscape renderings with a layout-guided diffusion model Fine-tune (finetune)ed through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (lora). PlantoGraphy has undergone a series of performance evaluations and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in landscape rendering generation and the high recognition of its interactive functionality.},

abstract = {As the platform economy enters the deep-water zone of intelligent transformation, generative artificial intelligence (AIGC) technology is reshaping the core logic of content production and marketing strategy. In this paper, we construct the ‘AIGC-DRIVE’ dynamic closed-loop model to explain the role of AIGC in the innovation of platform economy content production and marketing strategy, and carry out efficiency comparison, AB test of AIGC advertisement strategy, and research on users' privacy concerns, as well as combining with the typical case studies of Jitterbug and SHEIN. It is found that AIGC can greatly improve the production efficiency and support the real-time optimisation of dynamic marketing strategies through data-driven multimodal content generation; however, the application of the technology faces the risks of content homogenisation, algorithmic black-boxing and user privacy leakage. This paper proposes a synergistic mechanism of ‘technology embedding - institutional constraints - user feedback’ to achieve sustainable development, which provides a theoretical basis and a practical path for the design of the governance framework of AIGC in the platform economy.},

abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has created a level of chaos in higher education as both students and faculty try to determine its utility and how best to incorporate it into the learning process. Students may view generative AI as a means to an end of achieving a perfect grade, skipping important elements of the learning process, or they may view it as an opportunity to expand their creative efforts. Faculty may view it as a tool students use to circumvent plagiarism detection, may feel it potentially minimizes the role of faculty in the classroom, or they may view it as an opportunity to avail of a supplement to existing activities and assignments. Ultimately, faculty are faced with maintaining academic integrity and reinforcing the need and importance of the learning process. This paper explores the combination of three approaches: peer-supported incremental learning, master/apprentice model, and growth mindset as a way for faculty to guide appropriate student use of generative AI, while also maintaining the integrity of the learning process.},

abstract = {Written feedback has long been a cornerstone in educational and professional settings, essential for enhancing learning outcomes. However, multimodal feedback-integrating textual, auditory, and visual cues-promises a more engaging and effective learning experience. By leveraging multiple sensory channels, multimodal feedback better accommodates diverse learning preferences and aids in deeper information retention. Despite its potential, creating multimodal feedback poses challenges, including the need for increased time and resources. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offer solutions to automate the feedback process, predominantly focusing on textual feedback. Yet, the application of GenAI in generating multimodal feedback remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates the use of GenAI techniques to generate multimodal feedback, aiming to provide this feedback for large cohorts of learners, thereby enhancing learning experience and engagement. By exploring the potential of GenAI for this purpose, we propose a framework for automating the generation of multimodal feedback, which we name MuFIN.},

abstract = {Generative AI models have revolutionized intelligent systems by enabling machines to produce human-like content across diverse domains. However, their outputs often exhibit unpredictability due to complex and opaque internal semantic states, posing challenges for reliability in real-world applications. In this article, we introduce the AI Uncertainty Principle, a novel theoretical framework inspired by quantum mechanics, to model and quantify the inherent unpredictability in generative AI outputs. By drawing parallels with the uncertainty principle and superposition, we formalize the tradeoff between the precision of internal semantic states and output variability. Through comprehensive experiments involving state-of-the-art models and a variety of prompt designs, we analyze how factors such as specificity, complexity, tone, and style influence model behavior. Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts can significantly enhance output predictability and consistency, while excessive complexity or irrelevant information can increase uncertainty. We also show that ensemble techniques, such as Sigma-weighted aggregation across models and prompt variations, effectively improve reliability. Our findings have profound implications for the development of intelligent systems, emphasizing the critical role of prompt engineering and theoretical modeling in creating AI technologies that perceive, reason, and act predictably in the real world.},

This paper analyzes and sorts out the basic concept, research status, application scenarios through literature analysis, and design practice. It discusses the potential applications, problems, and challenges of it in product design and prospects for the future. Based on this, through the research, a conclusion has been drawn that the research of Generative AI is in its infancy in the field of product design. Generative AI is very advantageous in shortening the design cycle, improving design efficiency, and saving time and cost. At the same time, it also has certain application potential for designers in designing, product development, and enhancing user experience. However, there are many challenges that must also be faced, including technical limitations, ethical dilemmas, and legal problems. Therefore, how to properly cope with the current challenges and effectively integrate Generative AI into the existing design process has become an important issue at present.},

abstract = {Mathematical stories have demonstrated the ability to bolster the motivation and interest of students in learning mathematics, thereby exerting a positive influence on their academic performance. However, due to a lack of adequate resources and the desire to engage students in the creation process, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is utilized to generate mathematical stories accompanied by images. This study presents a framework for automatic quality assessment to evaluate the coherence of multimodal text and images generated by GAI, as well as the appropriateness of the stories for different grade levels. The dataset comprises mathematical stories generated by GAI for grades 3, 4, and 5, obtained from an American online learning platform, each story consisting of titles, bodies, and image illustrations generated by GP4, images generated by DALL-E3. Initially, a method is devised based on CLIP model and Mini-GPT4 for extracting multimodal semantic features to establish the relationship between text and images in mathematical stories and their generation parameters. Subsequently, mathematical text features are designed, including nine mathematical text attributes and ten traditional text readability indicators, followed by collinearity feature selection and statistical testing. Finally, five machine learning grade regressor for mathematical stories were trained, and the correlation between these 19 features and grades is explored using genetic algorithm-based factor mining and the interpretable artificial intelligence method SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To further understand advanced text features, the latest natural language processing (NLP) readability indicators are also integrated into the analysis. Through multimodal features, traditional text readability metrics, and NLP readability indicators, this method introduces a novel approach for automatically assessing the quality of GAI-generated multimodal mathematical stories, providing a tool for grade predictor and shedding light on the factors (Image-text relevance and textual features) influencing the grade level of analyzed stories, thereby offering new insights for leveraging GAI in mathematical education.},

It developed a human-machine collaborative learning system utilizing the SparkDesk and the WeChat system, providing learners with functions such as conversation, resource sharing, and intelligent teaching.

While there is an increasing interest in the adoption of GAI systems, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, there are also serious concerns about the copyright of the contents—the inputs or generated as outputs by the GAI systems. Such concerns need to be identified and assessed to ensure the ethical and responsible use of GAI systems. Thus, this article aims to address the key research challenge: “how to identify and assess GAI system's copyright concerns”? In response, we propose the development of a Copyright Risk Checker (CRC) Tool. This tool has been formulated and evaluated using a recognised design science research methodology, drawing on an analysis of 10 legal cases across Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. The CRC Tool has undergone evaluation through an experimental scenario, and the results suggest that it is suitable for conducting an indicative copyright risk check of GAI systems. The outcomes of this preliminary assessment can be further examined by expert legal advisors for an in-depth analysis. The development of the CRC Tool provides a foundation for continued research and advancement in this significant area of study.},

First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how AI tools can be integrated into mathematics education and highlights key differences between the Finnish educational context and previous studies based on structural equation modeling.},
