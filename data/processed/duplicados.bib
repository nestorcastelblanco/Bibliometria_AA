abstract = {CS50.ai is an AI-based educational tool developed and integrated into CS50 at Harvard University using large language models (LLMs), supporting both in-person and online learners. CS50.ai encapsulates a variety of AI-based tools designed to enhance students' learning by approximating a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio. We showcase: "Explain Highlighted Code," a Visual Studio (VS) Code extension that provides just-in-time explanations of code snippets; style50, a VS Code extension that offers formatting suggestions and explanations thereof; and our "CS50 Duck," an AI-based chatbot for course-related questions, implemented both as a VS Code extension and as a standalone web application. We also demonstrate the integration of our tools into Ed, the course's discussion forum. This demo will illustrate the functionality and effectiveness of these tools as well as the pedagogical "guardrails" that we put in place to ensure secure and fair usage of these tools, while sharing insights from our own experience therewith this past summer and fall.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as chatGPT and other AI-powered tools, has a significant impact on conducting research projects. Despite the advantages of this trend, it is believed that AI-powered tools should be utilized to enhance the literature review process rather than completely automating it. For this reason, this paper examines the emerging concept of "Literature Review as a Service" (LRaaS) based on the human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) perspective. Drawing on the theoretical background and service science, the paper explores a new approach to exploit the potential of AI-powered tools while putting people at the center of the research process. Through an initial prototype, the paper illustrates how AI-powered tools assist the literature review process. The paper ends with conclusions and recommendations for further research.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis technology is widely used in many fields such as network public opinion. It has important research significance in the field of natural language processing. In many network texts, sentiment analysis of each entity has always been an important issue. The traditional Bi-LSTM model has the problem of gradient explosion or excessive correction in the learning rate, which affects the convergence speed and stability of the model. In this paper, a Bi-LSTM optimization model combining progressive preheating and cosine annealing is proposed, which uses word embedding technology, word shape reduction technology and named entity recognition technology. Experiments show that our model can achieve high accuracy on both the training set and the verification set, and the loss is gradually reduced. It shows an accuracy of up to 84.13 \% in both positive and negative categories, which is significantly better than the existing baseline model. Through in-depth comparative analysis, the model shows obvious advantages in key performance indicators such as accuracy, recall rate and F1 value.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of 5G and mobile internet, various application fields continue to generate diverse dynamic streaming graphs with large scales and complex structures. Analyzing, querying and mining such a streaming graph face great challenges. To address the challenge of low query efficiency and avoid data loss, this paper proposes a two-stage coarsening method that preserves key features of a streaming graph while improves query efficiency. In the initial stage, the size of the streaming graph is not that large yet. To preserve its structure and attributes as much as possible, a linear mapping method is used for graph coarsening. As the size of the streaming graph increases, a graph neural network model based on cluster pooling is constructed in the second stage. Using a large number of graph coarsening results obtained in the initial stage to train and optimize this model. Then, we use this optimized model to obtain the subsequent summaries, which achieves online efficient graph coarsening. Finally, extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm significantly improves the quality of streaming graph coarsening compared to traditional algorithms. Even compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm Auxo, our algorithm shows a better performance on preserving key features.},

abstract = {Existing multimodal knowledge graph reasoning methods often rely on simple weighted averaging or attention mechanisms for multimodal feature fusion, which frequently results in the loss of modality-specific information and fails to fully exploit the complementary relationships between modalities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multimodal knowledge graph reasoning method based on a cross-attention mechanism. The model employs the BERT model to encode textual information, introduces a VGG-16 model with a multi-scale attention module to encode visual information, and utilizes a graph attention mechanism to extract the structural information of the knowledge graph. Additionally, a contrastive learning framework is introduced to reduce semantic inconsistencies between modalities, and a cross-attention mechanism is used to achieve dynamic feature fusion across modalities. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, comparative experiments were conducted on the FB15k-237 and DB15K datasets. The results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing benchmark models on key evaluation metrics such as MRR, Hit@1, Hit@3, and Hit@10, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in multimodal knowledge graph reasoning.},

Given the characteristics of class imbalance and high dimensionality of loan data, data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis are conducted. Based on a comparative analysis of various models, seven machine learning algorithms that demonstrate superior performance are selected for experimental comparison, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. The results indicate that ensemble learning algorithms exhibit higher accuracy and predictive performance compared to single algorithms, with the CatBoost model performing best across various indicators, including AUC. The study identifies key features highly correlated with loan defaults, including loan grade, annual income, loan amount, credit history length, and debt-to-income ratio.},

abstract = {Due to its easy-to-use characteristic, passwords are still the main way to authenticate a person online. However, as the increasing number of websites, users now often come across the issues of password overload. Such repeated use of one's passwords or choosing simple passwords such as names or dates could lead to serious security risks. Password-guessing simulations could effectively prevent these vulnerabilities. Nowadays, most modern websites request passwords with special characters to enhance their complexity. This study emphasizes the special characters within passwords. By using t-SNE visualization and KL divergence, we have analyzed the distribution of these characters among different passwords visually and quantitatively. As the result shows, special characters present a unique distribution mode in t-SNE visualization, with a higher KL divergence value than alphabetic and digit segments. Based on our findings, a password-guessing approach that classified the special character segments into four types according to the position named the Pos-PCFG model has been proposed. The model has improved the guessing accuracy of multiple datasets. In the Rockyou dataset test, accuracy was achieved with a notable 0.98\% increase when guessing passwords consisting of special characters.},

abstract = {In response to the problem of insufficient attack traffic samples in network intrusion detection datasets, a hybrid sampling data augmentation method (S-VAE) that combines SMOTE and VAE is proposed. Firstly, train corresponding VAE models for different types of attack traffic samples; Secondly, the SMOTE algorithm is used to extract the original samples and their neighboring samples from the dataset and store them in pairs; Then, the paired samples are fed into the trained VAE model to learn their latent representations separately, and the latent representations of the original and neighboring samples are linearly interpolated; Finally, the results of linear interpolation are fed into the trained VAE decoder to expand the new samples. In this way, a balanced dataset can be established to enable deep learning models to fully learn the features of a small number of samples. The experimental results showed that using convolutional neural network models for multi classification experiments on the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets, S-VAE increased the classification recall by 3.75 and 3.06 percentage points, respectively, and the F1 score by 6.49 and 4.29 percentage points, respectively, compared to the baseline model.},

The Fuch and Logistic chaotic maps are used for population initialization to enhance the global search ability. During the optimization process, the DBO algorithm's strong local exploitation ability and the GWO algorithm's global search characteristics are coordinated. A B\'{e}zier curve is employed to smooth the planned path.
