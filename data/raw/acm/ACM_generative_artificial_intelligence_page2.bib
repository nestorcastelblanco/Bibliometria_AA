abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is revolutionizing the field of higher education by leveraging deep learning models to generate human-like content. However, the use of GenAI in education raises ethical concerns such as the potential impact on critical thinking skills and the unethical or dishonest use by students. This paper analyzed the main problems existing in engineering courses in Chinese universities firstly and then proposed corresponding teaching reform measures based on the comprehensive consideration of the benefits and threats of GenAI. We applied the proposed teaching reform measures in the teaching of engineering courses, which greatly improved the teaching quality.},

abstract = {This study investigated the students' perceptions of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in upper-secondary mathematics education. Data was collected from Finnish high school students to represent how key constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model—Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Enjoyment, and Intention to Use—influence the adoption of AI tools. First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how AI tools can be integrated into mathematics education and highlights key differences between the Finnish educational context and previous studies based on structural equation modeling.},

abstract = {This research focuses on the application of AIGC in vocational education digital textbooks and how RAG technology can be used to further improve the interactivity and educational effectiveness of digital textbooks. The paper first analyzes the development of AIGC technology and its great potential in the field of education, especially the role of LLM in content generation. It then discusses the concept, risks, and construction strategies of vocational education digital textbooks, emphasizing the importance of digital textbooks in teaching and their differences compared with paper textbooks. The study also designs a knowledge retrieval question-answering system based on RAG, which combines school-based textbooks and cooperative enterprise manuals as a knowledge base to generate responses to student questions. While ensuring accuracy and completeness, the quality of the responses was improved by the merge of students' queries with relevant texts using RAG technology. Regarding implementation, RAG technology consists of knowledge base construction and knowledge retrieval. It includes segmenting the document, recognizing and vectorizing it in order to build a vector database. During user retrieval, queries are sorted through the vector database interface, and the matched knowledge fragments and query statements are merged to generate answers including specific domain knowledge. This framework of the RAG question-answering system can provide accurate answers to satisfy students of all levels in personalized teaching while maintaining explainability and timeliness of the content.},

abstract = {Improving undergraduate students' ability to cope with cyber risks is one of the key issues to be addressed in the digital transformation of higher education in the era of generative artificial intelligence. In order to explore how to improve undergraduate students' ability to cope with information security threats brought about by generative artificial intelligence, this paper constructs a theoretical model for improving undergraduate students' information security behaviour in the context of generative artificial intelligence by integrating the theory of protective motivation, the theory of planned behaviour, and the theory of social cognition. Based on 354 questionnaire survey data, this study systematically analyses the influencing factors and mechanisms of undergraduate students' information security in the context of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that perceived threat, subjective norms and self-efficacy have a positive influence on students' information security behaviour intention, which in turn has a positive influence on their information security behaviour implementation, with environmental support playing a moderating role between the two. The findings of the study help to further improve the theoretical model of undergraduate students' information security behaviour in the context of artificial intelligence, and at the same time provide valuable insights for education departments and colleges and universities to take effective measures to improve undergraduate students' information security capabilities in the era of generating artificial intelligence.},

For open education learners who aim to just obtain adult education diplomas, particularly, the cost of learning assessment is becoming increasingly low due to the use of generative AI. How to instructional design and assessment for open education learners in the era of generative AI becomes therefore an issue requiring urgent solutions.

While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT dominate current educational research, multimodal capabilities—such as text-to-speech and text-to-image—are less explored. This study uses topic modeling to map the research landscape of multimodal and generative AI in education. An extensive literature search yielded 4175 articles. Employing a topic modeling approach, latent topics were extracted, resulting in 38 interpretable topics organized into 14 thematic areas. Findings indicate a predominant focus on text-to-text models in educational contexts, with other modalities underexplored, overlooking the broader potential of multimodal approaches. The results suggest a research gap, stressing the importance of more balanced attention across different AI modalities and educational levels. In summary, this research provides an overview of current trends in generative AI for education, underlining opportunities for future exploration of multimodal technologies to fully realize the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in education.},

The article explores the role of multimodal large models in image processing and OCR of ancient books. We discuss and exemplify how to use Large Language Models for intelligent information processing of ancient texts and explore combining prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), supervised fine-tuning, LangChain, and other techniques to improve performance in ancient text mining and applications. This article also looks forward to the broad prospect of intelligent agent technology combined with the Large Language Model in the innovative application of ancient book revitalization. The research focuses on digitizing ancient books, intelligent processing of ancient texts, and intelligent application of ancient book revitalization. It demonstrates the feasibility, advancement, and creativity of the application of generative AI and its derivative technologies in the field of computational humanities, especially in the field of ancient book preservation, to provide intelligent solutions for the dissemination of traditional thought and culture, from the perspective of the whole process of the technology of digital humanities and computational humanities research. The article also gives examples of the intelligent application of AI in the restoration of ancient books and the annotation of ancient texts. Although Large Language Models demonstrate transformative potential in advancing the field of ancient text research toward intelligent analysis, there remain certain limitations. This article points out their shortcomings in areas such as knowledge completion for ancient texts, understanding emotions and cultural nuances, as well as ethical and accountability issues. It emphasizes the need for a more balanced perspective on the role that generative AI plays in the exploration and utilization of cultural heritage.},

This paper critically examines the multifaceted adoption of GenAI in HE by reviewing interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks from psychology, computer science, and pedagogy. It highlights the insufficiency of traditional technology acceptance models, which predominantly address cognitive and rational decision-making processes, and advocates for the inclusion of emotional and ethical dimensions often overlooked in existing frameworks. By synthesizing research across various disciplines, this review identifies significant gaps and proposes an integrated theoretical model to effectively understand and guide GenAI adoption. The proposed framework emphasizes the need for robust, empirically supported methodologies that accommodate the complex, dynamic nature of GenAI applications. This paper not only contributes to academic discourse by providing a comprehensive review of existing literature but also sets a foundation for future empirical studies aimed at refining GenAI integration strategies in HE, ensuring they are ethically aligned and educationally effective.},

Leveraging large language models (LLMs), CS50.ai offers a suite of AI-based tools that assist both students and instructors in mastering course material while overcoming the limitations posed by human resource constraints. This demo highlights how generative AI can be employed to conduct code reviews and pair-programming simulations, providing real-time feedback, code explanations, and collaborative programming insights. By integrating these AI tools into students' learning journeys, we aim to mimic the 1:1 interaction between instructor and student, improving both formative and summative assessments. We will showcase how these tools are implemented to scale personalized feedback, ensure academic integrity, and maintain pedagogical efficacy. Our presentation will also reflect on lessons learned from deploying these AI-driven tools in recent course offerings.},

Using a comparative research methodology, the study analyzed the most recent policy documents from these regions through text-mining techniques to assess their key differences in terms of word frequency and specific content. This work highlights the different strategies, goals, and approaches to regulating generative AI across the regions. It found that the EU adopts a more comprehensive and stringent regulation of generative AI, emphasizing regional harmonization and foresight; the U.S. regulation is characterized by pragmatism, closely aligned with industry innovation, and a focus on risk avoidance; while China focuses more on macro-level regulation aimed at promoting innovation and encouraging ecological construction.Participants may be interested in this study because it not only uses up-to-date materials but also employs text-mining methods to present the findings in a clearer way than previous studies. It provides insights into how regulatory policies for generative AI affect the development and practice of digital government. The study sheds light on different countries’ strategies for technology governance, which is crucial for understanding and designing effective digital government policies. In addition, due to the potential of generative AI technologies to deliver public services and drive government transparency, these insights help participants better assess the opportunities and challenges of technological innovation in the digital government space.},

abstract = {In computer-based learning environments (CBLEs), adopting effective self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies requires sophisticated coordination of multiple SRL processes. While various studies have proposed adaptive SRL scaffolds (i.e. real-time advice on adopting effective SRL processes) and embedded them in CBLEs to facilitate learners’ effective use of SRL strategies, two key research gaps remain. First, there is a lack of research on SRL scaffolds that are based on continuous assessment of both learners’ SRL processes and learning conditions (e.g., awareness of learning resources) to provide adaptive support. Second, current analytics-based scaffolding mechanisms lack the scalability needed to effectively address multiple learning conditions. Integration of analytics of SRL with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can provide scalable scaffolding for real-time SRL processes and evolving conditions. Yet, empirical studies implementing and evaluating effects of this integration remain scarce. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized control trial, assigning participants to three groups (control, process only, and process with condition groups) to investigate the effects of using GenAI to turn insights from real-time analytics about students’ SRL processes and conditions into adaptive scaffolds. The results demonstrate that integrating real-time analytics with GenAI in adaptive SRL scaffolds – addressing both SRL processes and dynamic conditions – promotes more metacognitive learning patterns compared to the control and process-only groups. In addition, the learners showed varying levels of compliance with analytics-based GenAI scaffolds, and this was also reflected in how the learners coordinated their SRL processes, particularly in the performance phase of SRL. This study contributes to the literature by designing, implementing, and evaluating the impact of adaptive scaffolds on learners’ SRL processes using real-time analytics with GenAI.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the influencing factors and their action mechanism for university teachers' acceptance of generative AI, this paper integrates the TAM and TOE model, focuses on the variables of self-efficacy, technological efficiency, technological complexity, organizational AI readiness, environmental support, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use, constructs a theoretical model of the influencing factors of university teachers' acceptance of generative AI, and based on 439 questionnaire survey data, the independent effect was analyzed by structural equation method, and the synergistic effect was analyzed by fsQCA method. The analysis results show that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have significant positive effects on university teachers' acceptance of generative AI. Self-efficacy, technical efficiency, organizational AI readiness and environmental support have significant positive effects on perceived usefulness. Self-efficacy, organizational AI readiness and environmental support have significant positive effects on perceived ease of use, and technical complexity has a significant negative effect. Furthermore, self-efficacy, technical efficiency, technical complexity, organizational AI readiness, and environmental support do not work independently but synergistically through different combinations, and there are three types of configurations of individual initiative type, system incubation type, and bilateral engagement type. The results of this research can help to further enrich the theoretical system of generative AI application in education, and can also provide practice suggestions for teachers, universities, and education management departments to take effective measures to enhance the acceptance of generative AI in higher education.},

It helps achieve the teaching objectives of practical courses in a particular way. Today, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)—particularly large language models—are advancing rapidly. Now, it is particularly critical to study how to combine educational practices and GenAI in school education. This review mainly studies how to make academic strategies superior and more effective. It is recommended to use the A-CDIO educational paradigm. To put it simply, this is a student-centered CDIO framework that incorporates GenAI. The example of “particle effects” is used in teaching. The findings show that this innovative pattern works in actual teaching settings. It not only improves student learning outcomes significantly, but also improves the quality and efficiency of the entire education.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of multimodal data such as text, images and videos on social networks, it is particularly important to extract valuable information from these diverse data sources. In this study, a multimodal sentiment analysis framework based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology is proposed, aiming at automatically identifying the emotional tendency in online product marketing information. By combining the latest generative AI technology, the model can not only analyze the direct feedback from users, but also capture the potential emotional color. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional single-modal sentiment analysis method, the accuracy of the proposed multimodal model is improved by 15\%, and the recall rate is improved by 12\%. This shows that the model can provide more accurate market insight for enterprises, and help to better understand customer needs, improve product design and optimize marketing strategies. The demonstrated multimodal sentiment analysis framework provides a powerful tool for understanding and responding to consumer sentiment. Future research will further explore how to enhance the generalization ability of the model and how to deal with emotional differences in cross-cultural background more effectively to achieve a wider application in the global scope.},

Conversational agents developed for HFA children in previous studies show limitations in children's learning effectiveness due to the conversational agents’ inability to dynamically generate personalized and contextual content. Recent advanced generative Artificial Intelligence techniques, with the capability to generate substantial diverse and high-quality texts and visual content, offer an opportunity for personalized assistance in emotional learning for HFA children. Based on the findings of our formative study, we integrated large language models and text-to-image models to develop a tool named EmoEden supporting children with HFA. Over a 22-day study involving six HFA children, it is observed that EmoEden effectively engaged children and improved their emotional recognition and expression abilities. Additionally, we identified the advantages and potential risks of applying generative AI to assist HFA children in emotional learning.},

Based on the technical characteristics of generative AI, combined with the project-based learning (PBL) approach, this study proposes specific paths and strategies to optimize online education platforms in colleges and universities. The study adopts the literature analysis method to systematically sort out the status quo and feasibility of generative AI and online education platform in colleges and universities. On this basis, this paper designs two main paths of intelligent generation of teaching resources and optimization of learning process based on generative AI. The former includes course content generation, teaching interaction generation and evaluation feedback generation; the latter covers learning data analysis, intelligent learning progress tracking and dynamic evaluation of learning effects. Through the theoretical analysis of the path design, this study provides a preliminary theoretical framework and practical ideas for the intelligent upgrading of online education platforms in colleges and universities, which can be used as a reference for the subsequent research and practical application in this field.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), exemplified by ChatGPT, Midjourney, and other state-of-the-art large language models and diffusion models, holds significant potential for transforming education and enhancing human productivity. While the prevalence of GenAI in education has motivated numerous research initiatives, integrating these technologies within the learning analytics (LA) cycle and their implications for practical interventions remain underexplored. This paper delves into the prospective opportunities and challenges GenAI poses for advancing LA. We present a concise overview of the current GenAI landscape and contextualise its potential roles within Clow’s generic framework of the LA cycle. We posit that GenAI can play pivotal roles in analysing unstructured data, generating synthetic learner data, enriching multimodal learner interactions, advancing interactive and explanatory analytics, and facilitating personalisation and adaptive interventions. As the lines blur between learners and GenAI tools, a renewed understanding of learners is needed. Future research can delve deep into frameworks and methodologies that advocate for human-AI collaboration. The LA community can play a pivotal role in capturing data about human and AI contributions and exploring how they can collaborate most effectively. As LA advances, it is essential to consider the pedagogical implications and broader socioeconomic impact of GenAI for ensuring an inclusive future.},

Through the bibliometric and content analysis methods, together with the CiteSpace tool, highlight the trending application of this technology in education, the distribution characteristics of the core authors and institutions' postings, and the clustering analysis of the research hotspots. The results show continued wide adoption of generative AI technology in education in recent years, peaking sharply in 2023. There hasn't been a stable core group of authors within the field, and the collaborative network is relatively sparse. Research hotspots mainly cover artificial intelligence, human-computer collaboration and educational transformation, which indicates the function generative AI technology could have within the digital transformation and quality enhancement of education. This paper additionally shows the actualization of generative AI technology through its presentation of AI tutors and teaching assistants, teaching models reform, and reshaped instructional evaluation systems via case studies. In face of misuse, integrity issues, and ethical concerns arising, there is a need to find a balance in the application of the technology, such that its more proper development can promote rather than replace human subjectivity.},

In anticipation of future advances and evolutions of GenAI, we capture a snapshot of student attitudes towards and uses of yet emerging GenAI, in a period of time before university policies had reacted to these technologies. We surveyed all computer science majors in a small engineering-focused R1 university in order to: (1) capture a baseline assessment of how GenAI has been immediately adopted by aspiring computer scientists; (2) describe computing students' GenAI-related needs and concerns for their education and careers; and (3) discuss GenAI influences on CS pedagogy, curriculum, culture, and policy. We present an exploratory qualitative analysis of this data and discuss the impact of our findings on the emerging conversation around GenAI and education.},

Based on the Integration Technology Acceptance Model (UTAUT), we analyzed the influence of factors such as performance expectations, effort expectations, social influences, and enabling conditions on primary and secondary school teachers' use of AIGC. Through questionnaire survey and data analysis, it was found that these factors have a significant effect on teachers' use of AIGC and that there are significant differences in teachers' personal characteristics such as teaching experience, gender and IT proficiency in terms of behavioral intention. In order to enhance teachers' intention to use AIGC, it is recommended to strengthen teachers' skill training, improve the quality of AIGC products, and optimize the smart teaching environment and application planning in schools.},

Simply prohibiting this new wave of technology cannot fundamentally address its challenges. This article presents the results of a survey investigating Chinese university students' perspectives on generative artificial intelligence technologies, such as ChatGPT, in supporting their learning. It analyzes the opportunities and challenges presented by this technology. Universities need to adapt to this transformation by altering the nature of student assignments and the methods of assessment. Additionally, they must effectively leverage the advantages of students conveniently acquiring knowledge through AIGC and the opportunity for personalized tutoring across various subjects. Striking the right balance between opportunities and challenges is crucial for creating a more productive and beneficial learning environment. Ultimately, this adaptation will better prepare education for the developments and changes in the era of artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {In Summer 2023, we developed and integrated a suite of AI-based software tools into CS50 at Harvard University. These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course's own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had "a personal tutor.'' Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues.

abstract = {Paradigm-breaking innovations in generative artificial intelligence (GAI) are revolutionizing the landscape of postgraduate education at an unprecedented rate.This work chooses a Chinese university's "Customer Relationship Management" course as a case and explores both channels and empirical implications of GAI-driven curriculum innovation. This study presents a 'Three-Tier Three-Driver' personalized teaching reform model that categorizes students into three tiers based on different career trajectories and leverages AI as a driver across three dimensions: teaching content, teaching methods, and assessment.Multiple AI tools and methods like AI teaching assistants, GPT models, knowledge graph construction, Q&amp;A modules, and AI assessment modules are used by the course to design the entire curriculum anew, boost pedagogical practice, and reconstruct assessment schemes.Data were collected from a questionnaire survey with 500 students and were modeled using K-Means clustering, DBSCAN density-based clustering algorithms and random forest models. Results demonstrate significant differences in student behaviors and perceptions related to AI tool usage across the different clusters.Effective use of AI technologies was found to benefit student satisfaction and academic performance. Furthermore, there was a significant association found between AI use times and course satisfaction, however DBSCAN could not detect a group of extreme learners.The study concludes by compiling replicable evidence of AI-driven teaching innovation and discussing existing limitations (such as the limited sample scope) as well as possible directions for future work.The conclusion uncovers GAI-empowered teaching innovation as a good promise for teaching quality improvement and personalized learning promotion for postgraduate education.},

A key question, then, is whether people believe news headlines generated by AI as much as news headlines generated by humans. AI is viewed as lacking human motives and emotions, suggesting that people might view news written by AI as more accurate. By contrast, two pre-registered experiments on representative U.S. samples (N = 4,034) showed that people rated news headlines written by AI as less accurate than those written by humans. People were more likely to incorrectly rate news headlines written by AI (vs. a human) as inaccurate when they were actually true, and more likely to correctly rate them as inaccurate when they were indeed false. Our findings are important given the increasing adoption of AI in news generation, and the associated ethical and governance pressures to disclose it use and address standards of transparency and accountability.},

abstract = {Conceptual design is an essential stage in the design process, and its ultimate success largely depends on designers’ creativity. Both physical and digital prototypes are commonly adopted by designers to support ideation and creativity, providing intuitive perception and rapid iteration, respectively. In recent advancements, large-scale generation models are able to offer data-enabled creativity support by generating high-quality solutions comparable to human designers. This opens up an imaginary space for designers and brings new possibilities for design tools. In this study, we proposed a hybrid prototype method that synergistically combines physical models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the conceptual design stage. Correspondingly, we developed a hybrid prototype system to implement the proposed method. We conducted a comparative user study with 45 designers who completed a design task using the physical prototype method, standalone generative AI and the hybrid prototype method, respectively. Our results verified the effectiveness of the hybrid prototype method and investigated its mechanism in supporting creativity. Finally, we discussed the application value and optimisation space of the hybrid prototype method.},

abstract = {This research explores the application of ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence technology, in the field of education. ChatGPT, short for "generative pre-training," continuously evolves and adapts through user feedback, facilitating authentic human-machine interaction. It can process natural language input and generate relevant responses, thereby providing information and answering questions. The study highlights the potential of ChatGPT in university teacher education, where it can offer intelligent teaching assistance, personalized learning resources, and instructional support. However, the integration of ChatGPT also raises challenges, such as redefining the authority of knowledge and altering the dynamics of the teacher-student relationship. Some scholars contend that ChatGPT cannot replicate genuine emotions or free will, underscoring the irreplaceable nature of education. The transformative impact of ChatGPT on education demands a reevaluation of teachers' roles and professional development in the digital age. This study seeks to clarify the role of teachers within the digital transformation represented by ChatGPT and to explore strategies for successfully navigating this shift. Additionally, the research aims to assess teachers' perceptions and utilization of ChatGPT, address related challenges, and evaluate the feasibility, potential applications, and limitations of its integration into teaching.},

Therefore, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study adopts the method of structural equation model to deeply understand the influencing factors of college students' dishonest behaviors in online learning under the background of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm all have a significant positive impact on behavior intention of dishonesty when online learning. Specifically, the attitude of dishonest behaviors in online learning is influenced by autonomous motivation (e.g., intrinsic interest, self-improvement) and controlled motivation (e.g., external rewards, avoidance of punishments); perceived behavioral control is influenced by autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and moral obligation; and the subjective norm is not only affected by autonomous motivation but also by moral obligation. Based on this, this study proposes some interventions to mitigate dishonest behaviors in online learning to create a good learning atmosphere for the online learning environment.},

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has begun to attract interest for its potential to address longstanding barriers to access. However, little is known about the impact of these tools on the living and learning experiences of post-secondary students with disabilities. As a mixed-abilities team, we investigated student experiences with GenAI tools by collecting survey and interview responses from 62 and 21 students with disabilities, respectively, across two universities to measure students’ use of GenAI tools and their perspectives on the impact of these tools in ways related to disability, university support, and sense of belonging. Despite concerns over potential risks of GenAI and unclear university policies, students described GenAI tools as a useful resource for personalizing learning, promoting self-care, and assisting with important self-advocacy work. Guidance demonstrating safe, acceptable uses of GenAI tools, along with clear policies and resources that acknowledge diverse student needs, were desired. We discuss implications of these tools for accessibility and inclusion in higher education.},

abstract = {In the face of the high requirements of vocational education for practical skills training, as well as the poor results and high costs of traditional training, this study aims to build an efficient and intelligent virtual training and simulation operation platform by introducing generative artificial intelligence technology to improve teaching quality and learning efficiency. This paper uses the adversarial generation ability of GAN and combines it with the knowledge graph in the field of vocational education to generate a high-fidelity and scalable virtual training environment. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to dynamically adjust the scene parameters to adapt to the needs of different majors and skill levels. Based on the Transformer multimodal dialogue model, a real-time operation guidance system integrating virtual and real is constructed. The physical engine is combined to simulate the feedback of equipment operation, and the long short-term memory network (LSTM) is used to capture the characteristics of the trainee's operation sequence, dynamically predict potential errors and trigger correction prompts. This paper also uses the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to build a personalized evaluation agent, using the trainee's operation data as the state space to generate targeted training suggestions. The average operation accuracy of the experimental group students reaches 89.715\%, the highest skill assessment pass rate reaches 100\%, and the overall distribution is more concentrated, reducing the cost of practical training. In addition, teachers and students highly evaluated the teaching adaptability, operation guidance and error correction functions of the platform. The teaching platform proposed in this study provides a new path and strategy for the modernization of vocational education.},
