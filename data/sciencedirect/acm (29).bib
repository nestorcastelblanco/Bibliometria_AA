abstract = {A study aims to establish a relationship between artificial intelligence-based systems by integrating the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for psychological modeling and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for error recognition. This review paper combines current developments in AI technology with recurrent neural networks (RNN) to study psychological aspects that impact tennis training strategy development. Study examined six studies from 2022 to 2024 by following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for systematic assessment. The selected findings assess AI-controlled psychological regulation alongside error action recognition and introduce improvements for online teaching and electronic line judging and automated ball transmitter path analysis and ball-passing net tracking systems. The research demonstrates that implementing RNNs optimized through AI systems produces better psychological state predictions that achieve 73\% successful intervention outcomes. Big data analytics improve online tennis education while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate 95.34\% success in error action recognition. The controversy about AI taking over human line judges persists because it raises technical advantages but also ethical considerations. The review demonstrates how AI offers substantial training transformations in tennis but shows unexplored research opportunities for the future.},

With AIGC, it can be effortless to generate high-quality data that is challenging for the public to distinguish. Nevertheless, the proliferation of generative data across cyberspace brings security and privacy issues, including privacy leakages of individuals and media forgery for fraudulent purposes. Consequently, both academia and industry begin to emphasize the trustworthiness of generative data, successively providing a series of countermeasures for security and privacy. In this survey, we systematically review the security and privacy on generative data in AIGC, particularly for the first time analyzing them from the perspective of information security properties. Specifically, we reveal the successful experiences of state-of-the-art countermeasures in terms of the foundational properties of privacy, controllability, authenticity, and compliance, respectively. Finally, we show some representative benchmarks, present a statistical analysis, and summarize the potential exploration directions from each of these properties.},

abstract = {As computers increasingly make decisions about who gets a loan, a job, or even bail, the expansion of AI algorithms has provoked public concern about ethical issues, and the need to understand what constitutes AI algorithms and how they make decisions becomes ever more pressing. For example, an increasing number of high-profile news reports that widely-used algorithms have unfairly discriminated against some groups of people (e.g., by gender and race) in parole decisions and other major life events. Focusing more attention on ethical bias in learning algorithms is key to unlocking the potential of automated decision systems while ensuring fairness and accountability so that everyone can advance equally in society. Ethical AI has become increasingly important and it has been attracting attention from academia and industry, due to its increased popularity in real-world applications with fairness concerns. It also places fundamental importance on ethical considerations in determining legitimate and illegitimate uses of AI. Organizations that apply ethical AI have clearly stated well-defined review processes to ensure adherence to legal guidelines. Therefore, the wave of research at the intersection of ethical AI in data mining and machine learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and social science.},

abstract = {In recent years, mental health issues among college students have been on the rise, with frequent concerns such as anxiety, depression, and heightened stress. As a result, there is an increasing interest in and demand for psychological guidance and counseling. Issues related to mental wellness are particularly common during adolescence and are beginning to affect younger demographics more frequently. Among individuals aged 18-24, the risk of depression has been detected at a rate of 24.1\%. The college years represent a crucial phase in student development, characterized by academic demands, social hurdles, and shifts in self-awareness, all of which can significantly influence mental well-being. As such, it is becoming ever more crucial for colleges to prioritize the prevention of mental health challenges among their students and to offer counseling and therapeutic services. This paper delves into the significance of psychological counseling alongside the foundational concepts of artificial intelligence. By analyzing data from a sample of 566 college students, it utilizes t-tests and chi-square analyses to investigate the current implementation of AI in psychological counseling. Utilizing machine learning techniques in conjunction with predictive models powered by big data and AI algorithms, the study organizes and processes fundamental student information. Chi-square analyses are employed to explore the links between different mental health dimensions and personal characteristics, providing colleges with insights for assessing and supporting students' mental well-being.},

abstract = {Traditional theory-practice integrated teaching models in secondary vocational education encounter various challenges. Theoretical content often appears overly abstract, and teacher-student interaction tends to be one-side,practical resources are usually scattered, and teaching evaluations frequently fall behind. To address these issues, this study proposes a teaching model driven by intelligent-digital integration, aiming to unify theory and practice effectively. The integration of AR/VR interactive learning systems, modular digital training systems, and intelligent classroom analytics systems constructs a closed-loop teaching framework. This framework follows the sequence of theory, practice, and evaluation. A case study on the course Microcontroller Application Technology verifies the effectiveness of this implementation. Findings indicate that the proposed model significantly improves learning outcomes. It also raises the frequency of classroom interaction and enhances the efficiency of completing practical tasks. The model gathers data in real time and evaluates it from multiple dimensions. This optimizes the teaching process across its entire cycle. It provides technical methods and practical models. These can be replicated for the digital transformation of vocational education.},

The study was conducted as a scenario-based survey, in which participants answered the question, "What could go wrong?" regarding five scenarios depicting fictional AI systems. The study concludes with the results from 33 survey participants who gave 161 responses to the scenarios. The results suggest that researchers can identify threats posed by AI systems, particularly regarding their social and ethical consequences. This is even though half of the participants reported limited involvement with AI ethics in their work. The widespread understanding of ethics among researchers could positively impact AI software development due to increased capabilities to bring theoretical AI ethics to practice.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid development of computer hardware and algorithm technology, artificial intelligence has shown significant advantages in product design, medical diagnosis and finance. This paper applies the method of visual analysis to reveal the research hotspots of user-centred product design in the field of artificial intelligence and discusses the future development trend of this field. The data for this study comes from 670 documents in the Web of Science database. Using visualisation tools such as CiteSpace 6.1.1 and VOSviewer, the literature on "Artificial Intelligence (AI)", "Users" and "Product Design (PD)" was analysed for the period from 2004 to 2024. Product Design (PD)" literature was analysed. Product Design (PD)" literature was analysed. It was found that over the past two decades, research in this field can be broadly categorised into three phases: initial development, rapid development and fluctuating growth. China has become a major force in this research area and has made a significant impact. The main research directions focus on technology and management innovation, advanced technology and industrial change, information technology and applications, and technology and user experience. The results of the study expose that user-centered product and service design needs to pay more attention to intelligence and personalization as a way to drive the development of service quality improvement.},

abstract = {Human participants play a central role in the development of modern artificial intelligence (AI) technology, in psychological science, and in user research. Recent advances in generative AI have attracted growing interest to the possibility of replacing human participants in these domains with AI surrogates. We survey several such “substitution proposals” to better understand the arguments for and against substituting human participants with modern generative AI. Our scoping review indicates that the recent wave of these proposals is motivated by goals such as reducing the costs of research and development work and increasing the diversity of collected data. However, these proposals ignore and ultimately conflict with foundational values of work with human participants: representation, inclusion, and understanding. This paper critically examines the principles and goals underlying human participation to help chart out paths for future work that truly centers and empowers participants.},

abstract = {The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) has been the center of the most outstanding advancements in the last years. The ability to analyze considerable streams of data in real time makes these technologies the most promising tool in many domains, including cybersecurity. As an outstanding example, ML can be used for identifying malware because of its ability to detect patterns otherwise difficult to see for humans and hard-coded rules. However, the use of AI and ML in security-relevant domains raised rightful concerns about their trustworthiness and robustness, espe- cially in front of adaptive attackers. Additionally, privacy threats are now emerging as a crucial aspect and need proper testing and possibly mitigation to prevent data stealing and leakage of sensitive information.

Therefore, this paper moves data processing and analysis from the centralized cloud to the edge of the network, near the user access point, aiming to reduce data transfer time and improve response speed, and utilizes artificial intelligence technology to enable more efficient and adaptive network management and service customization. This paper focuses on the role and advantages of edge computing in 5G communication, the application of artificial intelligence combined with edge computing in 5G communication, and the realization of edge AI technology architecture. Finally, two sets of simulation results are as follows: The average accuracy error of the optimized edge AI model and cloud AI model is less than 1\%, and the average response time is reduced by 31.9ms. The research helps to better understand network behavior, predict and manage traffic, and dynamically deploy resources.},

Then, we characterised and classified the current state of the art, focusing on 1) main aspects already tackled at the intersection of at least two of the three studied areas, and 2) findings emerging from the analysis as a framework for potential future research, notably regarding the integration of the three studied areas. The results reveal that few approaches combine MDE, AI/ML, and DevOps for software and systems engineering. In contrast, several approaches have combined two of them, specifically MDE and DevOps. Approaches combining AI/ML with MDE or DevOps are also becoming more frequent and will most likely continue to progress in the future. These synergies cover a range of engineering activities, from requirements and design to monitoring, maintenance, and evolution. Open research challenges include advancing AI/ML, MDE, and DevOps integration, supporting scalable, data-oriented solutions, proposing new continuous engineering methods, and adapting DevOps practices to diverse systems.},

abstract = {This paper provides a new framework for studying the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the organization of knowledge work. We incorporate AI into an economy where humans endogenously form hierarchical firms: Less knowledgeable agents become "workers" solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable agents become "solvers" handling exceptions. We model AI as an algorithm that uses compute to mimic humans. We compare the equilibrium before and after AI's introduction, distinguishing between "basic" AI (with knowledge equivalent to pre-AI workers) and "advanced" AI (with knowledge equivalent to pre-AI solvers). We show that basic AI increases the knowledge content of human work, leading to smaller, less productive, and less decentralized firms. In contrast, advanced AI decreases the knowledge content of human work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized firms. In any case, the most knowledgeable humans benefit from AI, while the least knowledgeable benefit only when AI is sufficiently advanced. We discuss how these effects depend on AI's autonomy and the availability of compute. https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05481},

abstract = {The continuous development of social media in scientific communication and the arrival of the era of artificial intelligence have provided more possibilities for evaluating the influence of scholars, making evaluation algorithms no longer limited to quantitative indicators. On the basis of existing scholars' influence evaluation algorithms at home and abroad, this article designs a scholar influence evaluation approach and algorithm based on open peer review. That is, the qualitative content of open peer review in scholar articles is processed by certain artificial intelligence technology to form multiple label sets that can represent the influence of scholars from different dimensions, thus exploring the multi angle evaluation of scholar influence from a quality perspective. Finally, this article conducts empirical research and comparative analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using the open peer review platform F1000 as the data source platform. Empirical research has shown that the algorithm proposed in this article provides a new perspective and approach for evaluating the influence of scholars, which can preliminarily achieve multidimensional evaluation of scholars, endow scholars with personal academic profiles, and enhance the fullness and recognition of scholar influence. Comparative analysis shows that this algorithm does not have a significant correlation with bibliometric evaluation algorithms and can serve as a supplement to the existing evaluation system. The combination of traditional bibliometric analysis algorithms and open peer review based algorithms will be the future development trend of academic evaluation.},

However, the roles foreseen for AI systems within teams remain unclear. We systematically reviewed the literature on AI deployment in anesthesiology and found that most AI system papers only describe algorithms. We identified 57 interactive systems and assigned six roles based on described behavior, tasks, and interactions. While the most prevalent role was task completer, some AI systems also served their team as problem solvers, evaluators, task motivators, or even teamwork support and team leaders. We contribute (1) a classification system for team roles, behaviors, tasks, and interactions of AI team members and (2) an overview of AI systems’ team roles in anesthesiology. We conclude that (3) AI systems’ intended social roles within teams need to be more consciously reflected, shaped and clearly communicated to meet healthcare standards.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of digital and intelligent technology, enterprises have encountered many difficulties in managing human resources. The problems of scattered data, untimely manual decision-making, and mismatch between employees and positions are becoming more and more common. Management methods that used to rely on personal experience or fixed rules can't keep up with the pace of business changes now. On the other hand, artificial intelligence, especially deep learning algorithm, brings new and promising solutions, which can handle human resources-related work more efficiently and accurately. This paper discusses the main challenges faced by human resource allocation in artificial intelligence environment, introduces how AI technology can help, and puts forward some improvement strategies using XGBoost algorithm. This model is not only supported by survey data, but also tested in actual scenes. The results show that this method works well and can really optimize the allocation of human resources. We hope that through this research, we can provide some practical suggestions for enterprises to adjust their human resource management in the AI era, and help them maintain their competitive advantage and operate more smoothly.},

abstract = {Generative AI is increasingly used to create images from text, but its role in documentary photography remains under-explored. This paper investigates how generative AI can be integrated into documentary practice while maintaining ethical standards. Through interviews with six documentary photographers, we explored their views on AI’s potential to support community-driven storytelling. While AI presents opportunities for creative expression and community involvement, concerns about trust, authenticity, and decontextualization of images persist. Photographers expressed doubts about AI’s ability to accurately represent lived experiences, fearing it could compromise narrative integrity. Our findings suggest that AI tools should be designed to enhance collaboration and transparency in storytelling, complementing rather than replacing traditional documentary methods. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI in photography, advocating for the development of tools that preserve the ethical foundations of documentary storytelling while empowering communities.},

However, deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals remain largely excluded from these developments. This study explores how music GenAI could enhance the music-making experience of DHH individuals, who often rely on hearing people to translate sounds and music. We developed a multimodal music-making assistive tool informed by focus group interviews. This tool enables DHH users to create and edit music independently through language interaction with music GenAI, supported by integrated visual and tactile feedback. Our findings from the music-making study revealed that the system empowers them to engage in independent and proactive music-making activities, increasing their confidence, fostering musical expression, and positively shifting their attitudes toward music. Contributing to inclusive art by preserving the unique sensory characteristics of DHH individuals, this study demonstrates how music GenAI can benefit a marginalized community, fostering independent creative expression.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has made significant contributions in various aspects and domains of human life, permeating fields such as Education, Healthcare, Economy, Socialization, Security, Agriculture, and Privacy. This research specifically delves into the promising possibilities and applications of AI in healthcare and medical domains, focusing on developing a Medical Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. The proposed approach involves using different pre-trained NER models and an in-house-generated corpora to train a personalized Spacy model. The research then conducts a thorough comparison of these models to understand their strengths and shortcomings. Widening the scope of the proposed research, we introduce an inventive mechanism to extract medical information from doctors' audio in real-time saved on buffer memory, deleted after use, which is then used to create patient medical prescriptions. The potential benefits of this mechanism are vast, expanding beyond reducing patient wait times, enhancing the clarity of prescriptions, maintains comprehensive patient histories, and finally introducing automation into the prescription drug ordering chain. Additionally, the proposed model eases the scheduling and management of medical tests and procedures based on doctor and patient availability. In jist, the proposed paper aims to present an innovative human-centric approach to automating interactions between patients and doctors and optimizing the delivery of healthcare services. Through the integration of modern-day AI services, The proposed mechanism has the potential to bring about a potential change in medical practices, providing a more efficient and effective breakthrough to patient care.},

abstract = {Text-to-image models can generate visually appealing images from text descriptions. Efforts have been devoted to improving model controls with prompt tuning and spatial conditioning. However, our formative study highlights the challenges for non-expert users in crafting appropriate prompts and specifying fine-grained spatial conditions (e.g., depth or canny references) to generate semantically cohesive images, especially when multiple objects are involved. In response, we introduce SketchFlex, an interactive system designed to improve the flexibility of spatially conditioned image generation using rough region sketches. The system automatically infers user prompts with rational descriptions within a semantic space enriched by crowd-sourced object attributes and relationships. Additionally, SketchFlex refines users’ rough sketches into canny-based shape anchors, ensuring the generation quality and alignment of user intentions. Experimental results demonstrate that SketchFlex achieves more cohesive image generations than end-to-end models, meanwhile significantly reducing cognitive load and better matching user intentions compared to region-based generation baseline.},

abstract = {Recent methodologies have achieved good performance in objectively summarizing important information from fact-based datasets such as Extreme Summarization and CNN Daily Mail. These methodologies involve abstractive summarization, extracting the core content from an input text and transforming it into natural sentences. Unlike fact-based documents, opinion-based documents require a thorough analysis of sentiment and understanding of the writer’s intention. However, existing models do not explicitly consider these factors. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel text summarization model that is specifically designed for opinion-based documents. Specifically, we identify the sentiment distribution of the entire document and train the summarization model to focus on major opinions that conform to the intended message while randomly masking minor opinions. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing summarization models in summarizing opinion-based documents, effectively capturing and highlighting the main opinions in the generated abstractive summaries.},

abstract = {Generative AI has made impressive strides in enabling users to create diverse and realistic visual content such as images, videos, and audio. However, training generative models on large centralized datasets can pose challenges in terms of data privacy, security, and accessibility. Federated learning (FL) is an approach that uses decentralized techniques to collaboratively train a shared deep learning model while retaining the training data on individual edge devices to preserve data privacy. This paper proposes a novel method for training a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) across multiple data sources using FL techniques. Diffusion models, a newly emerging generative model, show promising results in achieving superior quality images than Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our proposed method Phoenix is an unconditional diffusion model that leverages strategies to improve the data diversity of generated samples even when trained on data with statistical heterogeneity or Non-IID (Non-Independent and Identically Distributed) data. We demonstrate how our approach outperforms the default diffusion model in a FL setting. These results indicate that high-quality samples can be generated by maintaining data diversity, preserving privacy, and reducing communication between data sources, offering exciting new possibilities in the field of generative AI.},
