abstract = {Traditional imaging examinations, blood tests, and biomarker tests often have problems with insufficient sensitivity and specificity. To this end, this paper focuses on artificial intelligence, especially the application of Deep Learning (DL) models in CT (computed tomography) image analysis and diagnosis, and explores its potential in early cancer detection. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to tumor detection in CT images. First, the image data is standardized, including resizing and normalization, to make sure that the input data is consistent, and more training samples are generated through methods for augmenting data (e.g., cropping, flipping, rotation, etc.) to enhance the model's capacity for generalization. The CNN model is primarily composed of convolutional layers, layers that pool together, fully linked layers, and functions for activation. The convolutional layers automatically extract low-level features (such as edges, textures, etc.) in the image through local receptive fields, and the pooling layers further reduce the feature dimension and enhance the model's anti-noise ability. Finally, the experimental data show that the method in this paper achieves an accuracy of 96.63 and a prediction time of 1.81 seconds, which is almost comparable to that of the professional doctor, but it is substantially shorter in prediction time.},

abstract = {This study looks into the best approaches for government subsidies to promote the spread of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare. It examines two different subsidy strategies and creates an evolutionary game model of AI medical technology diffusion in the context of a Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) network. The two subsidy strategies are analyzed in detail, factoring in the maturity of the technology, the initial proportion of firms, and the initial proportion of hospitals. The study finds that: 1) Government subsidies fixed in advance negatively affect technology diffusion when the maturity of the technology is uncertain. 2) Increased proportion of high-share hospitals increased the spread of AI technology because the enhanced market share benefits the firms using AI technology which causes them to attract other firms to copy that strategy. 3) From the perspective of the uncertainty of effectiveness, the adaptive subsidies perform better than fixed subsidies across all scenarios. 4) A higher initial proportion of hospitals using AI results in greater spreads of AI technology. The governments are recommended to use adaptive subsidies and to focus support on hospitals in order to reduce the barriers to entry. The government should also provide infrastructure and establish more higher-level hospitals to allow for the more effective use of resources.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, the role of teachers and the training mechanism of normal university students are undergoing profound changes. The purpose of this study is to explore the interaction model between teachers and normal university students in primary and secondary schools based on artificial intelligence, build a two-way empowerment model, and emphasize the mutual promotion and common growth of teachers and normal university students in the training process. This study clearly puts forward the importance of teachers' deep participation in the training of normal university students and constructs a theoretical framework of teacher education oriented to practice. Deep participation means that teachers actively, continuously and comprehensively participate in the training process of normal university students through teaching design, practical guidance and feedback evaluation. Based on the above framework, this study takes the students majoring in education in Sichuan Normal University as the research object, and conducts a comparative experiment to verify the application effect of artificial intelligence under the framework of two-way empowerment. In addition, in view of the challenges faced, this study also puts forward suggestions on path optimization, so that teachers and students can grow together with the support of artificial intelligence, that is, both sides can jointly improve educational concepts, teaching methods and professional quality, thus promoting the continuous progress of education.},

abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents about 85\% of total lung cancer cases. The main curative treatment for locally advanced patients who cannot undergo surgery relies on radiotherapy but target delineation using traditional CT faces challenges related to physician skill and lacks adequate predictive dimensions for treatment outcomes. The integration of artificial intelligence technologies with multimodal imaging has become more common to enhance both target delineation precision and treatment effectiveness prediction. The functional imaging capabilities of PET/CT and MRI help doctors evaluate suspicious metastatic lymph nodes and separate tumors from atelectasis or inflammation through metabolic and microstructural information. Deep learning algorithms enable radiomics models to extract image-based high-dimensional features which predict local control rates and survival outcomes and other clinical results. The current implementation of AI-assisted multimodal imaging in NSCLC radiotherapy faces multiple challenges including non-standardized data and inadequate model interpretability and insufficient clinical workflow integration. Further radiomics and multi-omics research needs urgent attention especially when radiotherapy combines with immunotherapy or targeted therapy. The future development requires three main steps: enhancing large-scale multicenter data sharing for external validation and developing interpretable AI algorithms and individualized adaptive radiotherapy strategies while promoting standardized clinical AI-assisted multimodal imaging applications to achieve precise and efficient NSCLC radiotherapy.},

It is born to solve the problems faced by the previous generation of the Internet such as imbalanced distribution of interests, monopoly of platform resources, and leakage of personal privacy. In this survey, we discuss the latest development status of Web 3.0 and the application of emerging AI technologies in it. First, we investigate the current successful practices of Web 3.0 and various components in the current Web 3.0 ecosystem and thus propose the hierarchical architecture of the Web 3.0 ecosystem from the perspective of application scenarios. The architecture we proposed contains four layers: data management, value circulation, ecological governance, and application scenarios. We dive into the current state of development and the main challenges and issues present in each layer. In this context, we find that AI technology will have great potential. We first briefly introduce the role that artificial intelligence technology may play in the development of Web 3.0. Then, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the current application status of artificial intelligence technology in the four layers of Web 3.0 and provide some insights into its potential future development directions.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is continuing to transform the communications industry, especially the field of public relations (PR). Understanding how PR students view and respond to this technological shift is becoming necessary to education and career choice. This study examined how Chinese PR students' perceptions of AI affect their career choices in PR through the lens of social cognitive career theory (SCCT). The study investigated the relationships between AI self-efficacy, outcome expectation of AI, interest in AI, AI contextual support and barrier, and PR career choice. Using an online questionnaire, the researcher collected data from 444 PR students at a Chinese university. SPSS was used to analyze the data, and reliability analysis, exploratory factor analysis, correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis were conducted to test the hypothesized relationships among the variables. The regression results indicated that AI self-efficacy, outcome expectation of AI, interest in AI, and AI contextual support positively influenced students' intention to pursue a career in PR. AI contextual barrier showed a significant negative impact on PR career choice. This study contributes to understanding how emerging technologies affect career decisions in PR education and has important implications for curriculum development and career guidance. It suggests that PR educators should focus on developing students' AI competencies while fostering their professional interests and that institutions should provide adequate support systems for AI learning. In addition, the findings provide valuable insights for PR programs that prepare students for an AI-enhanced industry.},

In this paper, we will explore the application areas of AI in cultural industry supply chain management, analyse the benefits and challenges it brings, and look forward to the future development trend of the integration of AI and supply chain. Traditional supply chain management methods often require a large amount of manpower to manage and monitor due to the lack of intelligence and automation. This not only increases the operating costs for the development of cultural and creative industries, but also may adversely affect the development of cultural industries due to poor information transmission and errors caused by human factors. With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, these problems are gradually being solved. Through the application of artificial intelligence technology, the intelligence and automation of supply chain management can be realised, and the reliance on human resources can be reduced. The application of artificial intelligence technology in supply chain management has great potential. It can effectively solve the problems of traditional management methods and improve the competitiveness and operational efficiency of cultural industry development. Therefore, more and more cultural industries have begun to pay attention to and try to apply AI to supply chain management in order to achieve more efficient and smarter operations.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing a crucial role both in the technological advances and emerging advanced threats in cybersecurity. Despite efforts by competent authorities in Europe to regulate the use of AI in a way that aligns with the ethics and individuals’ fundamental rights, there are still challenges to be tackled, not to mention the malicious use of AI by cybercriminals. In this paper we present a novel framework that is composed of innovative cybersecurity services that leverage AI to provide support in the management of the incident response and recovery lifecycle of the critical entities’ systems against advanced attacks. The paper describes the main components and architecture of the AI4CYBER framework and provides a clear understanding of the application of the autonomous intelligent cybersecurity services and their role in enforcing defensive actions throughout the entire lifecycle of the systems.},

abstract = {The timeless masterpiece “Tao Te Ching” is one of the greatest works in Chinese history, focusing on the philosophical concept of “morality” and discussing the ways of self-cultivation, governance, military strategy, and health preservation. It mostly focuses on politics and is known as the study of “inner sage and outer king”. Its profound meaning and broad content make it the king of all classics. The Tao Te Ching has had a profound impact on traditional philosophy, science, politics, religion, and more. According to UNESCO statistics, the Tao Te Ching is the cultural masterpiece with the highest number of translations into foreign languages after the Bible. Known as the “source of Chinese culture” and the “king of ten thousand classics”. This article takes an interdisciplinary and historical perspective, using scientific and mathematical analysis methods, to analyze the guiding spirit of the philosophical ideas in the Tao Te Ching for innovative thinking and optimization strategies in the development of artificial intelligence. This article combines artificial intelligence technology to develop the underlying logic of algorithms from four aspects: “Dao follows nature”, “governing by inaction”, “coexistence of existence and non existence”, and “knowing white and guarding black”; Ethical governance architecture for artificial intelligence algorithms; Analyze and elaborate on the future development direction of artificial intelligence in society. Provided new ethical foundations, governance models, and innovative paradigms for the development of artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {Information freshness, measured by the Age-of-Information (AoI) metric, is a crucial aspect of conventional network systems. However, the emergence of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) introduces unique requirements for assessing information freshness, rendering the traditional AoI definition inadequate. This is because the traditional AoI metric operates under the presumption that each data packet bears equal significance. In contrast, AIoT systems must prioritize the transmission of event summaries from smart IoT devices. To promptly capture events as they occur at the sources, we propose a novel information freshness metric called Age of Event (AoE). Subsequently, we thoroughly investigate the problem of AoE-minimizing transmission scheduling. This issue presents a formidable challenge because the event occurrence pattern can be unpredictable, and more crucially, the base station only becomes aware of these occurrences post-transmission. In response, we formulate algorithms and conduct a theoretical analysis applicable to scenarios characterized by complete, zero, or partial knowledge of event occurrences. Evaluations performed on a real traffic event dataset reveal that even in the absence of complete knowledge, our algorithms exhibit competitive performance when compared against the clairvoyant benchmark and markedly outperform AoI baselines.},

abstract = {Generative AI (GAI) is impacting teaching and learning directly or indirectly across a range of subjects and disciplines. As educators, we need to understand the potential and limitations of AI in HCI education and ensure our graduating HCI students are aware of the potential and limitations of AI in HCI. In this paper, we report on the main pedagogical insights gained from the inclusion of generative AI into a 10-week undergraduate module. We designed the module to encourage student experimentation with GAI models as part of the design brief requirement and planned practical sessions and discussions. Our insights are based on replies to a survey sent out to the students after completing the module. Our key findings, for HCI educators, report on the use of AI as a persona for developing project ideas and creating resources for design, and AI as a mirror for reflecting students’ understanding of key concepts and ideas and highlighting knowledge gaps. We also discuss potential pitfalls that should be considered and the need to assess students’ literacies and assumptions of GAIs as pedagogical tools. Finally, we put forward the case for educators to take the opportunities GAI presents as an educational tool and be experimental, creative, and courageous in their practice. We end with a discussion of our findings in relation to the TPACK framework in HCI.},

abstract = {Filigree art, which represents typical intricate metalwork, has been captivating audiences worldwide with its delicate lace-like patterns and interwoven metal wires’ refined aesthetics. Particularly, Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage filigree craftsmanship has a unique aesthetic value in fine patterns and complex three-dimensional shapes. However, designing and creating filigree artworks is a labor-intensive and technically complex task and often requires extensive training and a deep understanding of the craft, which limits its design aesthetic and cultural continuity. Aiming to overcome these challenges, this study proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) -aided method that uses AI-generated content (AIGC) technology to accelerate the visualization process of this time-consuming and intricate craft by investigating the role of AI in craft design. First, a comprehensive study of filigree art culture is conducted to identify more than ten historic filigree techniques to obtain AI opportunities. Then, an AI-powered framework called AIFiligree is developed by optimizing culture-based labels and training parameters, enabling the generation of highly authentic fine filigree structures. Further, user workflows are introduced to support diverse design scenarios. Through user studies involving 22 filigree experts and 16 designers, we finally gained insights into AI’s opportunities and challenges in cultural learning, expression, and design.},

We initiated the study by considering the traditional AT-making processes performed by OTs and prototyped a web interface that incorporates generative AI to support these processes. Through a series of user studies, we collected OTs' preliminary insights on how generative AI could bridge the gap between clinical reasoning and technical design, potentially streamlining the AT creation and adaptation process while maintaining the crucial element of personalized AT solutions. The study's findings highlight several key benefits of generative AI in OT practice: 1) customization of AT solutions tailored to individual client needs, 2) improved visualization capabilities for client communication, 3) inspiration for new AT design ideas, and 4) potential for rapid prototyping and practice. However, key drawbacks were noted, including limitations in inputting measurements, which can lead to inaccurate outputs and necessitate substantial modifications to the created AT, along with challenges associated with the current state of generative AI.},

In this paper we discuss our experiences in developing and using a scientific research application using an automated multi-facility workflow that orchestrates data collection, preprocessing, artificial intelligence (AI) inferencing, and data movement across diverse computational resources, leveraging the Advanced Computing Ecosystem Testbed at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF). We demonstrate that our workflow can be seamlessly integrated and orchestrated across research facilities managed by different federal agencies, thus allowing users to extract new scientific insights from climate datasets. The experimental results indicate that the multi-facility workflow significantly reduces processing time, enhances scalability, and maintains high efficiency across varying workloads. Notably, our workflow processes 12,000 high-resolution satellite images in just 44 seconds using 80 workers distributed across 10 nodes on the OLCF systems. Such high throughput is essential for dynamic tokenization and sharding of petascale satellite data for distributed AI model training and inferencing at scale across thousands of GPUs.},

This paper proposes a different view: prompts function as cognitive interfaces that mediate between user intent and algorithmic generation. Integrating theories of external cognition, interface semiotics, and pragmatist theories of situated inquiry, the paper provides a theoretical framing of prompting along three interrelated dimensions: semantic projection, compositional structuring, and interpretive negotiation. Through an empirical vignette from branding communication, I show how prompting can be seen as a dynamic representational activity, deeply embedded in cognitive processes of exploration, articulation, and iterative refinement. By reframing the prompt as a site of cognitive labor rather than as a static interface, this expands our understanding of interaction with generative AI as epistemic, semiotic, and situated.},

abstract = {Recently, as one of the most popular covert communication technologies, generative steganography has received ever-increasing attention due to its promising performance against sophisticated steganalysis tools. However, it is quite difficult for the existing generative steganographic approaches to find a good tradeoff between hiding capacity and extraction accuracy, mainly due to the small capacity of their hiding spaces. To overcome this shortcoming, a Progressive Generative Steganography (PGS) network architecture is proposed to hide a secret message during the progressive image generation process to realize secure covert communication. Specifically, we first propose a robust Secret-to-Noise (S2N) mapping method to encode the secret message as a set of noise maps. Then, guided by these noise maps, a set of corresponding images ranging from low resolution to high resolution are progressively generated by the Single Generative Adversarial Networks (SINGAN). Consequently, a large-sized secret message can be hidden in the finally generated high-resolution image, since a set of high-capacity hiding spaces can be provided by the process of progressive image generation. Moreover, to improve the quality of image generation and the accuracy of secret message extraction, a Dense Secret-Feature Connection (DSFC) strategy is designed and integrated into the proposed PGS network architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PGS outperforms the existing approaches in the aspects of both hiding capacity and message extraction, while maintaining promising anti-detectability and imperceptibility for covert communication.},

abstract = {We are concurrently witnessing two significant shifts: voice and chat-based conversational user interfaces (CUIs) are becoming ubiquitous (especially more recently due to advances in generative AI and LLMs - large language models), and older people are becoming a very large demographic group (and increasingly adopting of mobile technology on which such interfaces are present). However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research.},

abstract = {Information Retrieval (IR) systems are crucial tools for users to access information, which have long been dominated by traditional methods relying on similarity matching. With the advancement of pre-trained language models, Generative Information Retrieval (GenIR) emerges as a novel paradigm, attracting increasing attention. Based on the form of information provided to users, current research in GenIR can be categorized into two aspects: (1) Generative Retrieval (GR) leverages the generative model’s parameters for memorizing documents, enabling retrieval by directly generating relevant document identifiers without explicit indexing. (2) Reliable Response Generation employs language models to directly generate information users seek, breaking the limitations of traditional IR in terms of document granularity and relevance matching while offering flexibility, efficiency, and creativity to meet practical needs. This article aims to systematically review the latest research progress in GenIR. We will summarize the advancements in GR regarding model training and structure, document identifier, incremental learning, and so on, as well as progress in reliable response generation in aspects of internal knowledge memorization, external knowledge augmentation, and so on. We also review the evaluation, challenges, and future developments in GenIR systems. This review aims to offer a comprehensive reference for researchers, encouraging further development in the GenIR field (Github Repository: ).},

This paper addresses this challenge by proposing the AI-GFA (Assess, Implement, Gather Feedback, Act) framework, designed to enable proactive ethical assessments to predict potential risks associated with AI technologies. Through examination of existing ethical frameworks, legislation, principles, and guidelines, this paper aims to bridge the gap between high-level ethical guidelines and their practical application in AI development workflows. The framework emphasises transparency, accountability, and stakeholder involvement, and aligns with consequentialist, deontological, and virtue ethics perspectives. AI-GFA aims to empower development teams to proactively address ethical risks by facilitating informed decision-making and promoting a culture of ethical accountability, transparency, and stakeholder involvement to maximise overall utility by considering a wide range of perspectives and potential consequences.},

abstract = {This study examined 120 Turkish stories written for primary, secondary, high school, and undergraduate education levels by ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini1.5 Pro. The data was processed by software created with Natural Language Processing methods in mind. The general characteristics, quantitative characteristics, and readability of the stories were all reviewed within the scope of the study. Using the Ate\c{s}man and Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formulas, which are widely used for Turkish texts, the readability of the stories was calculated. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that AI is able to produce distinct stories, and it generates cohesive stories by utilizing subjects and themes that are suitable for a specific educational audience. When the average readabilities are taken into account, it has been found that ChatGPT-3.5 generates better stories suited for the education level based on the Ate\c{s}man formula and Gemini based on the Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formula, and the difficulty level of ChatGPT-3.5 stories rises in tandem with education level in both formulas. Also, the stories at the undergraduate level were found to be the hardest to read and with primary schools having the easiest readability. When the number of stories at readability levels is taken into account, it has been found that GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 in the Ate\c{s}man formula and ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini in the Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formula generate appropriate stories for the education level; the levels range from easy to difficult as the education level increases. Additionally, it has been found that the number of stories included is gradually increasing. It was concluded that AIs produced stories above their educational level; while ChatGPT-3.5 and Gemini were more successful in story production, the Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formula was better in determining readability.},

abstract = {Policy advising in government centers on the analysis of public problems and the developing of recommendations for dealing with them. In carrying out this work, policy analysts consult a variety of sources and work to synthesize that body of evidence into useful decision support documents commonly called briefing notes. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) have led to the continuing development of tools that can undertake a similar task. Given a brief prompt, a large language model (LLM) can synthesize information in content databases. This article documents the findings from an experiment that tested whether contemporary NLP technology is capable of producing public policy relevant briefing notes that expert evaluators judge to be useful. The research involved two stages. First, briefing notes were created using three models: NLP generated; human generated; and NLP generated/human edited. Next, two panels of retired senior public servants (with only one panel informed of the use of NLP in the experiment) were asked to judge the briefing notes using a heuristic evaluation rubric. The findings indicate that contemporary NLP tools were not able to, on their own, generate useful policy briefings. However, the feedback from the expert evaluators indicates that automatically generated briefing notes might serve as a useful supplement to the work of human policy analysts. And the speed with which the capabilities of NLP tools are developing, supplemented with access to a larger corpus of previously prepared policy briefings and other policy-relevant material, suggests that the quality of automatically generated briefings may improve significantly in the coming years. The article concludes with reflections on what such improvements might mean for the future practice of policy analysis.},

The literature presents examples of AI use cases in Africa to exemplify the opportunities, benefits, challenges, and risks of AI. Also, available reports highlight similar narratives with recommendations to improve the status quo. While such recommendations are essential, assessing what actions have already been implemented toward AI adoption is equally important. Still, more research is needed to showcase a holistic view of efforts taken by African countries to prepare for planning and implementing AI responsibly. This paper bridges the gap by examining the readiness of AI adoption in African countries from the literature using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. Findings reveal the need for further initiatives to realize the positive outcomes of AI technologies.
