abstract = {Medical image analysis is essential for accurate disease diagnosis, with multimodal imaging offering complementary information to enhance diagnostic precision. However, current GAN architectures exhibit limitations in feature fusion efficiency, synthesized image quality, and classification accuracy. In this study, a GAN-based multimodal medical image generation and classification model was constructed. First, features are extracted using multi-scale receptive fields, key channels are enhanced by combining the channel attention mechanism, and the cross-enhanced fusion module realizes the fusion of MRI and PET features. In addition, Generator 3D is responsible for generating realistic medical images and classifying diseases through the classification header. Discriminator 3D is used to discriminate the realism of the images. Meanwhile, a comprehensive loss function is designed to optimize the generator's performance by combining adversarial loss, correlation loss, mean loss, and classification loss. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality medical images and perform well on the classification task. It effectively improves the performance of medical image analysis and provides strong support for clinical diagnosis.},

abstract = {In recent years, as AI has grown fast, generative AI has been used a lot in building design.But when generative AI tries to create Wind-Responsive Passive Building Facades, it doesn't understand the moving look of the facade very well. This makes it bad at telling the important features and not good at working with different design cases.This study tries to make generative AI better at designing Wind-Responsive Passive Building Facades by using the K-means clustering algorithm.First, this study built a dataset with facade images, weather conditions, material types, and size info. Then, using the K-means clustering algorithm, we picked out key features and grouped the buildings by type. The goal is to give generative AI a better kind of visual data to learn from.Based on that, we made a three-level prompt structure to help generative AI work better with different design tasks.This study not only builds a clear method between finding building features and making prompts, but also gives ideas and steps for using generative AI more in sustainable building design.},

abstract = {We introduce BlockGuardian, a next-generation framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) with adaptive parallel processing to deliver precise and scalable analysis of blockchain codebases. Traditional static analyzers rely heavily on rigid rule-based systems, often missing nuanced vulnerabilities and domain-specific inconsistencies. In contrast, BlockGuardian leverages DeepSeek's advanced semantic reasoning across four critical dimensions; structural integrity, code quality, security vulnerabilities, and documentation completeness, to provide a holistic evaluation of blockchain codebases. Extensive benchmarks on leading platforms including Ethereum, FISCO-BCOS, Hyperledger Fabric, and Raychain, demonstrate that BlockGuardian detects 37\% more critical vulnerabilities than state-of-the-art tools while maintaining a false positive rate under 8\%. Moreover, our adaptive parallelization strategy yields an increase in throughput. By uniting LLM-driven natural language understanding with domain-specific security analysis, BlockGuardian sets a new standard for intelligent, high-performance auditing of decentralized applications.},

From automating test case design to enabling continuous testing in DevOps pipelines, AI-driven tools enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and speed of software testing. At the same time, the integration of AI components into software-reliant systems introduces new challenges for verification and validation (V&amp;V). Traditional T&amp;E methodologies must evolve to address issues such as AI bias, hallucinated outputs, and the complexity of validating non-deterministic behaviors. This position paper examines how existing T&amp;E methods must evolve to account for AI's stochastic nature, and conversely how GenAI is transforming T&amp;E practices across the software development lifecycle (SDLC).},

Software engineering, as an increasingly complex process to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain large-scale software systems for solving real-world challenges, is profoundly affected by many revolutionary artificial intelligence tools in general and machine learning in particular. In this roadmap for artificial intelligence in software engineering, we highlight the recent deep impact of artificial intelligence on software engineering by discussing successful stories of applications of artificial intelligence to classic and new software development challenges. We identify the new challenges that the software engineering community has to address in the coming years to successfully apply artificial intelligence in software engineering, and we share our research roadmap toward the effective use of artificial intelligence in the software engineering profession, while still protecting fundamental human values.We spotlight three main areas that challenge the research in software engineering: the use of generative artificial intelligence and large language models for engineering large software systems, the need of large and unbiased datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating deep learning and large language models for software engineering, and the need of a new code of digital ethics to apply artificial intelligence in software engineering.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to changes in educational practices by creating opportunities for personalized learning and immediate support. Computer science student perceptions and behaviors towards GenAI tools have been studied, but the effects of such tools on student learning have yet to be determined conclusively. We investigate the impact of GenAI tools on computing students' performance in a database course and aim to understand why students use GenAI tools in assignments. Our mixed-methods study (N=226) asked students to self-report whether they used a GenAI tool to complete a part of an assignment and why. Our results reveal that students utilizing GenAI tools performed better on the assignment part in which LLMs were permitted but did worse in other parts of the assignment and in the course overall. Also, those who did not use GenAI tools viewed more discussion board posts and participated more than those who used ChatGPT. This suggests that using GenAI tools may not lead to better skill development or mental models, at least not if the use of such tools is unsupervised, and that engagement with official course help supports may be affected. Further, our thematic analysis of reasons for using or not using GenAI tools, helps understand why students are drawn to these tools. Shedding light into such aspects empowers instructors to be proactive in how to encourage, supervise, and handle the use or integration of GenAI into courses, fostering good learning habits.},

The model yields robust clustering results, revealing clear differences in behavioral and content-driven characteristics. To identify the key drivers of streamer success, feature importance was evaluated using both Random Forest and effect size analysis. The results highlight variables such as views per live session, bullet comments, and new followers as the most influential factors. Statistical testing confirms that the majority of features significantly differ between the two groups, supporting the validity of the clustering framework.

However, existing studies still lacks systematic modeling of the implementation mechanism of this public fund allocation model. In response to the inherent complexity of the operating logic of this model and the unstructured characteristics of policy texts and enterprise data, this paper innovatively proposes a large language models-based multi-agent collaborative intelligent allocation method for public funds. This method consists of three core intelligent agents: policy agent, enterprise agent, and match agent. Among them, the policy agent is responsible for parsing policy texts and simulating government decision-making processes. The enterprise agent constructs the enterprise profile by integrating structured and unstructured data, and automatically generate funding application forms. The match agent is responsible for outputting the matching results and their decision basis. Through experimental research on a real-world dataset, this paper verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Rather than using AI to make art that imitates the work of human artists, we aim to design machines to support human artists in their creative work. However, assisting in creative tasks without getting in the way of the artist’s workflow can be challenging. Since there is no "correct" answer in creative works for the machine to steer towards, the machine must gauge the "goodness" or "badness" of its actions by watching the user’s response. We present our system, ‘Hero’, for eliciting and developing interactions around creative machines, particularly drawing machines. It uses multi-modal information about the user to steer when it should intervene in the creative process. We are using this system in user studies and interviews with artists to understand what modalities they would use to interact with and give feedback to a machine without disrupting their usual sense of creative workflow. This paper outlines this project’s background, Hero’s current system design, ongoing user experiments, and our planned future work to develop a mixed-initiative, multi-modal collaborative machine for creative tasks. This is a step towards bringing generative artificial intelligence into the messy complexity of physically embodied creative practice.},

abstract = {The curricular design of programs in Higher Education is increasingly oriented towards competence-based learning goals in order to provide more specific and explicit qualifications. At the same time the descriptions of competences are mostly based on textual descriptions often in informal style targeted towards different audiences making descriptions vague and harder to compare. Formal models for the specification of competences exist for some time and even semantic models are being developed, e.g., the European Learning Model. These different approaches lead to a gap between formal and informal competence descriptions that require manual efforts of curriculum designer to maintain. This research borrows the concept of Deep and Surface representation models from the field of linguistics to unify the different approaches. Additionally, it focuses on the functionality of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the form of Large Language Models to close the aforementioned gap. It demonstrates the potential of the technology in both directions and discusses application potential of the concept.},

abstract = {While Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has made significant strides in various sectors, there’s a discernible gap in literature regarding its specific applications and implications within the Financial Technology (FinTech) landscape. This paper endeavors to address this void, evaluating the potential of FinTech to harness GenAI’s capabilities and the existing discussions on GenAI’s impact in the domain. Through a comprehensive analysis of its integration by leading financial institutions such as Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and Capital One, the study offers insights into GenAI’s transformative potential in FinTech. We discuss the main problems these companies are solving, from identification and mitigation of fraudulent activities and ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks to improving customer service and operations and making better data-driven decisions. By addressing both the opportunities and challenges, this paper aims to provide a holistic perspective on the role of GenAI in the evolving FinTech sector.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offers numerous opportunities to revolutionise teaching and learning in Computing Education (CE). However, educators have expressed concerns that students may over-rely on GenAI and use these tools to generate solutions without engaging in the learning process. While substantial research has explored GenAI use in CE, and many Computer Science (CS) educators have expressed their opinions and suggestions on the subject, there remains little consensus on implementing curricula and assessment changes.In this paper, we describe our experiences with using GenAI in CS-focused educational settings and the changes we have implemented accordingly in our teaching in recent years since the popularisation of GenAI. From our experiences, we propose two primary actions for the CE community: 1) redesign take-home assignments to incorporate GenAI use and assess students on their process of using GenAI to solve a task rather than simply on the final product; 2) redefine the role of educators to emphasise metacognitive aspects of learning, such as critical thinking and self-evaluation. This paper presents and discusses these stances and outlines several practical methods to implement these strategies in CS classrooms. Then, we advocate for more research addressing the concrete impacts of GenAI on CE, especially those evaluating the validity and effectiveness of new teaching practices.},

abstract = {The limited availability of labeled defect data poses a critical challenge in developing robust industrial defect detection systems. This study presents a Transformer-guided diffusion framework capable of synthesizing high-quality defect images for data augmentation. A Transformer encoder is embedded within a U-Net-based denoising network, facilitating the modeling of long-range dependencies and preserving fine-grained local textures. An Adaptive Defect Attention Block (ADAB) is incorporated to enhance the representation of subtle defect features through combined spatial and channel-wise attention. A multi-channel hybrid loss function supervises both image content and defect mask consistency, promoting structural coherence and stable training. Experimental evaluations on the Cotton Fabric and MVTec datasets reveal that the proposed method consistently surpasses diffusion-based baselines—including DDPM, Sin-Diffusion, and Defect-Gen—across various metrics such as LPIPS, DISTS, PSNR, FID, and SSIM. These results highlight the effectiveness of the architectural improvements in producing realistic and diverse defect images. The proposed framework offers a practical and scalable solution for industrial scenarios constrained by limited defect annotations.},

abstract = {Rising demand for hyper-personalized wealth management is increasingly unmet by traditional advisory models, which suffer from limitations in scalability, cost-efficiency, and objectivity. While recent AI-driven solutions show promise, they often remain fragmented, focusing on isolated tasks and lacking a unified architecture that integrates long-term strategy with dynamic behavioral adaptation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Wealth-Voyager, a multi-agent framework that synergizes strategic asset allocation with adaptive tactical adjustments. Our system’s architecture uniquely combines AlphaForge, a quantitative engine for establishing a long-term strategic portfolio, with DualAdvisor, a novel Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) grounded role-playing simulation that interactively manages user-specific behavioral biases in response to real-time events. Our proof-of-concept case study, conducted under live market conditions, demonstrated the efficacy of this integrated approach. The system’s adaptive tactical adjustments outperformed a passive baseline, converting a marginal gain into a more substantial return while reducing portfolio volatility. Our work presents a blueprint for a new class of financial co-pilots that integrate quantitative rigor with interactive, cognitively-aware guidance, enhancing both decision quality and user trust.},

A double-dynamic movement primitive (DMP) is introduced to model robot motion, including a baseline DMP for learning to generate the desired trajectory, and a virtual DMP for generating a reference trajectory, which can compensate for the effect caused by task uncertainties by designing the coupling term and time scaling factor in DMP model. Besides, a kinematics feedback controller of adaptive gain for redundant manipulator is designed to track the position and orientation trajectory in Cartesian space. The proposed method applies the double-DMP model to realize the adaptation at both planning level and control level. Without a complex controller design, it improves the tracking performance of the demonstrated trajectory under task uncertainties, which is convenient for a practical environment. The experiments have been carried out on a Kinova robot, the results have confirmed the validity of the proposed method.},

abstract = {With the increasing integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into cultural heritage dissemination, users' digital interactions in museums have evolved from passive information reception to active co-creation. To investigate the mechanisms through which GenAI usability influences user enjoyment, this study applies the Hedonic Motivation System Adoption Model (HMSAM) and develops a theoretical framework incorporating six mediating constructs: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, curiosity, joy, sense of control, and immersion. Based on 582 valid responses collected from the “Cloud Tour of Dunhuang” digital heritage initiative, structural equation modeling was conducted using SmartPLS 4.0. The findings reveal that GenAI usability does not directly affect users' enjoyment; instead, its influence is transmitted indirectly through several psychological mediators. Specifically, GenAI usability significantly enhances perceived ease of use, usefulness, curiosity, joy, and control, each of which contributes to users’ enjoyment, with joy demonstrating the strongest mediating effect. Although GenAI usability also increases users’ sense of immersion, immersion itself does not significantly predict enjoyment. These results extend the applicability of HMSAM in the cultural technology domain, deepen the theoretical understanding of user behavior in smart museums, and offer practical guidance for optimizing GenAI-based interactive system design in cultural heritage contexts.},

abstract = {Novelty assessment is a cornerstone of technological innovation and intellectual property protection, profoundly influencing national technology strategies and economic development. Traditional evaluation models, which rely on domain experts, face significant challenges, including subjectivity, inconsistency, and low efficiency. These issues are exacerbated by the surging volume of global patent applications. While generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising avenues for automation, their prevalent use of implicit reasoning often leads to "hallucinations" and weak discrimination capabilities, rendering them unsuitable for the logically rigorous task of patent novelty assessment. To address this gap, this paper introduces TCL-MFSNE (Temporal-Contrastive Learning Multi-Agent Framework with Byzantine Consensus for Scientific Novelty Evaluation), an advanced multi-agent framework designed to systematically enhance the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of evaluations. The core of TCL-MFSNE rests on three pillars: (1) Explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning, which guides the model to generate detailed, transparent reasoning steps, overcoming the black-box nature of implicit reasoning. (2) Two-Dimensional Contrastive Learning, which includes "Positive-Negative Contrastive Learning" to sharpen the model's ability to discern key novel features by learning from paired authorized and unauthorized patents, and "Temporal Contrastive Learning" to ensure evaluations are accurately contextualized within the historical technological landscape. (3) Byzantine Consensus Mechanism, which leverages multiple heterogeneous LLM agents for independent evaluations and employs a consensus algorithm to filter out individual agent errors or biases, ensuring a stable and reliable final decision. We conducted comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset of patents filed between 2008 and 2024. The results demonstrate that the TCL-MFSNE framework achieves an accuracy and F1-score of 85\%, significantly outperforming baseline models such as implicit LLMs, single-agent systems, and other ablation variants. This research not only provides a viable solution for automated patent novelty assessment but also offers a new paradigm for applying generative AI to other professional domains that demand high precision and strong logical coherence.},

abstract = {With the increase in the volume of data within auditing environment, the risk assessment of audit increasingly depends on data-based anomaly detection and internal control issues detection. In this paper, we propose a novel deep generative model with variational autoencoder Hierarchical Attention-Driven VAE (HAD-VAE) for audit risk scoring and review visualization. The model extends the typical VAE framework, and forms a two-layer hidden structure of latent variables for current study to capture both global behavioral patterns of the audit object and small local differences in transactions’ features. Through the design of attention mechanism and weighting to the modeling of temporal audit features, the model improves the raw skills of perceiving high risk behaviors, and leverages prior risk information from the auditing field to regularize the latent space of embedding, which enables the model to learn more discriminative risk representations. In the decoder side, the model uses two channels to reconstruct path: one channel for numerical fields and another for the semantic descriptions of transactions, which enable fine-grained modeling of the complex data, and supports the following visualization analysis. The loss function of the overall training maximizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) and adds a contrastive loss to further separate high-risk samples from low-risk samples in the latent space. HAD-VAE achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both risk scoring accuracy and anomaly localization.},

It specifically analyzes the moderating role of trust in the relationship between technology-task fit (TTF) and acceptance, and the mediating role of intention to use between perceived usefulness and acceptance. Data were collected via a questionnaire survey from 352 valid respondents, covering core variables: TTF, trust level, perceived usefulness, intention to use, and acceptance. Statistical methods including reliability tests, correlation analysis, and regression analysis were employed to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that trust significantly enhances the positive effect of TTF on acceptance. Furthermore, intention to use partially mediates the relationship between perceived usefulness and acceptance, explaining 43.05\% of the total effect. High reliability was confirmed for all variables, and correlation results supported the theoretical framework. The findings conclude that trust level and intention to use act as crucial moderator and mediator, respectively, in the acceptance process of generative AI tools, with TTF and perceived usefulness being key determinants of acceptance. This research offers significant insights for promoting the application of generative AI within academic publishing.},

abstract = {In order to study the compressive strength of cemented gravel, a compressive strength prediction model was established; with 142 groups of in-house uniaxial compressive strength test data of cemented gravel with different mixing ratios as the object of study, the 11 influencing factors in the samples were downscaled by using the principal component analysis method, and the downscaled principal components were used as the input layer of the BPNN, so as to establish the compressive strength prediction of cemented gravel based on the PCA-BPNN model. The results show that when the number of principal components is 3, the cumulative contribution rate of the principal components reaches 86.483\%, and the contribution rates of the three principal components are 65.084\%, 11.702\%, 9.097\%, and the eigenvalues of the three principal components are all greater than 1. Then the three principal components are used as the input layer to build the compressive strength model of cemented gravel based on PCA-BPNN, and the RMSEs of the training set and test set are 0.253 and 0.28, respectively. The RMSE of the training set and the test set are 0.253 and 0.286, and the R2 is 0.947 and 0.942, which are not much different from the BPNN model with the number of nodes in the input layer of 6 and 11 before dimensionality reduction, and they are obviously better than the BPNN model in the convergence speed and training time. It can be seen that the PCA-BPNN model has good prediction effect and prediction efficiency, especially drastically reducing the training time, which provides a new idea for the prediction research of the mechanical properties of cemented gravel.},

However, AI-generated images often lack cultural context, which risks cultural bias and the loss of cultural significance. This study explores the use of GAI in generating culturally meaningful patterns, focusing on Chinese intangible cultural heritage Huayao cross-stitch as a case study. By applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to optimize T2I tools and using in-situ interviews and focus groups, we collected feedback from 18 Huayao artisans. The results show that while fine-tuned models improved stylistic accuracy, the cultural meaning of the patterns remained insufficient. This research highlights AI's limited role in cultural innovation and emphasizes the necessity for dynamically maintaining cultural authenticity through the daily practices of cultural holders. It also reflects on how AI might have a long-term impact on the creative position of artisan communities.},

This study focuses on platform ecosystems and develops a transmission mechanism model called “digital empowerment–value emergence–network performance” by using value emergence as a theoretical framework. Using structural equation modeling on 501 valid samples, the model is empirically validated. The findings reveal two pathways through which digital empowerment impacts platform network performance: directly enhancing network efficiency through technological, platform, and ecological empowerment, and indirectly amplifying network effects via the mediating mechanism of value emergence, including efficiency, integrative, and generative values. This research sheds light on how digital technology reshapes resource allocation and fosters collaborative innovation among ecosystem actors, ultimately driving a systemic leap in overall value. It offers both theoretical understanding and useful recommendations for platform ecosystem development.},

abstract = {Multimodal MRI synthesis is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, particularly in glioma segmentation. However, cross-subject synthesis faces significant challenges due to the variability in brain structures and tumor morphology across individuals. Existing methods often fail to preserve tumor region fidelity, limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose the Tumor Representation Consistency Alignment Generative Adversarial Network (TRCA-GAN), a novel framework designed to enhance tumor region fidelity in cross-subject multimodal MRI synthesis. TRCA-GAN introduces two key innovations: the Region-Aware Perturbation Module (RAPM), which enhances tumor structure preservation through adaptive perturbation and joint attention mechanisms, and the Local Contrast Discriminator Module (LCDM), which improves tumor contrast fidelity via a dual physical-feature constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2021 dataset demonstrate that TRCA-GAN significantly outperforms comparison methods in terms of image generation quality and tumor segmentation accuracy. The results highlight the effectiveness of TRCA-GAN in addressing the challenges of cross-subject MRI synthesis, making it a powerful tool for clinical applications.},

abstract = {The emergence of foundational models and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is poised to transform productivity in scientific computing, especially in code development, refactoring, and translating from one programming language to another. However, because the output of GenAI cannot be guaranteed to be correct, manual intervention remains necessary. Some of this intervention can be automated through task-specific tools, alongside additional methodologies for correctness verification and effective prompt development. We explored the application of GenAI in assisting with code translation, language interoperability, and codebase inspection within a legacy Fortran codebase used to simulate particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the process, we developed a tool, CodeScribe, which combines prompt engineering with user supervision to establish an efficient process for code conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate how CodeScribe assists in converting Fortran code to C++, generating Fortran-C APIs for integrating legacy systems with modern C++ libraries, and providing developer support for code organization and algorithm implementation. We also address the challenges of AI-driven code translation and highlight its benefits for enhancing productivity in scientific computing workflows.},

abstract = {With the development of The Times, the importance of financial robots to today's society has become increasingly prominent, the current financial robots have gone beyond the initial positioning of "automated tools", its core advantage is to reduce the economic threshold, users only need a small amount of money to enjoy low rates, high transparency of automated investment management. This paper uses scientific quantitative analysis methods to select research papers from 1990 to 2024 and conduct a systematic review. Based on the 127 papers retrieved, it uses Bibliometrics' to analyze and visualize the documents. In conclusion, the study affirms the role of financial robots in the future era and points out that they have significantly improved the timeliness and objectivity of investment decisions. Scholarly inquiry into robot-advisors emerged during an embryonic phase of conceptual exploration circa 2017, subsequently undergoing accelerated proliferation to attain a research apogee by 2023—a trajectory that epitomizes the discipline's ascendant status within modern academic priorities. Concurrently, Chinese academics have emerged as preeminent contributors to this global intellectual ecosystem, exhibiting not only the highest density of scholarly output but also pioneering methodological rigor and cross-disciplinary influence, as evidenced by citation dominance and paradigm-shifting theoretical frameworks. Empirical syntheses further delineate robot-advisors as a transformative force in institutional praxis, particularly through their reconfiguration of investor engagement protocols, decision-support architectures, and accountability matrices in algorithmic governance. These multifaceted contributions collectively cement their indispensability as both operational infrastructure and epistemological catalysts within contemporary financial technology discourse.},

Traditional statistical and machine learning methods face limitations in modeling the temporal dependencies inherent in financial and market data, making it difficult to capture long-term trends effectively. To address this challenge, this study proposes a corporate return on investment (ROI) prediction model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model integrates corporate financial indicators, market behavior data, and macroeconomic variables to construct a deep learning framework for multivariate time series analysis. A sliding window mechanism and unified data preprocessing pipeline are developed to improve the model's capability of learning complex dynamic patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms benchmark methods such as ARIMA and SVR in terms of mean squared error, mean absolute error, and trend prediction accuracy, showing superior stability and long-term forecasting ability. This research confirms the feasibility of applying deep learning techniques to enterprise financial modeling and provides theoretical support and methodological reference for building intelligent investment research systems.},
