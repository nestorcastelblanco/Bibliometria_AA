abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a novel technology with profound implications for education and deep learning, particularly due to its advancements in image generation. This progress has had a disruptive impact on the design industry, where designers are increasingly embracing generative AI images as innovative tools and techniques to enhance design ideation and creative expression. Integrating generative AI images into design education has become an inevitable trend, as it guides students in developing a deeper understanding of design aesthetics. However, the current application of generative AI images in design education lacks innovative use grounded in design theory. Therefore, the incorporation of generative AI images within the framework of design theory becomes crucial to interpret and refine design processes and design thinking. This research aims to explore the application of generative AI images in design semiotics, utilizing design theory as its foundation. By integrating design processes and incorporating design case studies, the study seeks to analyze how generative AI images can be effectively applied in design semiotics. Ultimately, the research strives to establish a pedagogical approach for the application of generative AI image-based design semiotics.},

abstract = {The increasing popularity of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technology offers new possibilities and challenges for teaching and promoting human-AI collaborative learning. In order to enhance the learning quality and experience of students, it is important to develop an effective instructional design, particularly in defining the goals and strategies, solving individual needs, and enhancing learning performance. However, the impact of implementing GAI in student learning and performance enhancement considerations is still lacking. Therefore, this study proposes an experimental framework for evaluating the effectiveness of GAI-based learning for students. By scrutinizing instructional goals and design strategies to achieve desirable learning outcomes, it provides guidelines on coverage design and development in GAI-based learning environments. Experiment with case studies on supply chain and cold chain management is adopted to analyze the effectiveness and facilitate instructional design in GAI-based learning to enhance the student learning experience. The result indicates that the treatment group outperformed the control group. This study is expected to provide insights into academic development and future education on GAI-based learning.},

Our analysis revealed that GAI would reduce the demand for teachers, weaken the teacher-student tie, and exacerbate the students’ digital overdependence, causing conflicts in data ethics and intellectual property. Thus, recommendations are made here for the four parties involved in the research: the government should formulate laws to strengthen network supervision; schools need to advance the digital reform on talent training models; teachers need to keep up with the latest educational theories to shift their roles; and students need to remain critical and independent thinkers in the age of educational digitalization 2.0.},

The designed conceptual framework aims to automate the evaluation of researchers' publications across three core dimensions: originality, significance, and rigor by leveraging state-of-the-art GenAI technologies. Beyond providing quantitative scores and personalized feedback, the system enables researchers to make better decisions by integrating these evaluation results with additional supporting information, such as journal impact factors and altmetrics, thereby optimizing their research performance and RAE submission strategies. The conceptual system architecture consists of four layers: data ingestion, AI processing, decision support, and user interface. This paper focuses on proposing the architectural design of such a GenAI-based DSS, and through a preliminary interface design case study, we demonstrate how the GenAI-based DSS can provide data-driven insights through a human-machine collaborative approach, thereby improving evaluation efficiency. The MetricAI is designed to improve efficiency, transparency, and strategic nature of RAE preparation work.},

This paper attempts to enhance the detection performance of small targets by integrating the bionic perception of brain-inspired intelligence with the data augmentation capabilities of generative models. Firstly, we simulate the multi-scale attention mechanism of the biological visual system using a brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN), enhancing the spatial sensitivity of small target detection. Secondly, we generate high-quality small target samples and optimize local feature representation through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), alleviating data scarcity and feature ambiguity. This paper proposes for the first time a solution providing a cross-modal collaborative framework for small target detection, exploring the potential of combining brain-inspired mechanisms with generative models.},

abstract = {Traditional supply chain management mainly relies on historical data and static models such as autoregressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA). However, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system still has the disadvantages, including delayed response, inaccurate long tail demand forecasting, and weak risk resistance and so on. Presently generative AI (GenAI) demonstrates the capability to enhance supply chain resilience significantly through synthetic data augmentation, multimodel analysis, and dynamic optimization technologies. For example, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) can generate extreme market scenario data to compensate for the lack of historical data and Large Language Model (LLM) can analyze social media public opinion and perceive changes in demand in advance.In this paper, the predictive ability of GenAI for future markets and the possibility of developing supply chain plans was investigated and then the market trends in 2025 and beyond were predicted based on the market data of the latest five years before 2025, using GenAI deep learning and integrating external variables such as economic indicators and simulating multiple future scenarios. The conclusions reveal that one of the most important advantages lies in AI's deep learning ability and foresight, which can identify potential supply chain disruptions in advance within a certain period of time and have adaptability, dynamically adjusting strategies to cope with sudden fluctuations. Besides, the analysis of AI application data in Lenovo, DHL, and Meituan also has been observed that GenAI has the extremely advantages to optimize time and high efficiency of production planning in supply chain management with the improved resource utilization and promoted growth of transaction order volume. Moreover, the fitting curves between the functions learned by GenAI combined with Python and traditional artificial learning models were compared, whereas, it was found that GenAI deep learning models still have shortcomings and face the challenge of data dispersion and inconsistency in supply chain optimization applications. Therefore, in the future, with the development of multimodel AI and causal reasoning, the focus of the technology should be on the research of strengthening the optimization of model algorithms, with assisting the use of mathematical methods to enhance the accuracy of GenAI models, so that this technology can truly become a core tool for dynamically predicting markets.},

This paper focuses on how refined textual prompt design can enhance the precision of image generation. It systematically analyzes the linguistic strategies used in subject description, environment construction, style constraints, lighting control, and compositional elements. By comparing the outcomes of vague prompts with those of detailed prompts, the study demonstrates that clear attribute specifications (such as age, ethnicity, and emotional state), spatiotemporal scene details (e.g., weather conditions, background dynamics), and explicit boundary settings (e.g., negation constraints, spatial symmetry) are critical to reducing image distortion and enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, the paper proposes a multi-element prompt template to serve as a practical linguistic control framework for image generation tasks. The study emphasizes that prompts are not merely input commands but essential logical units for output regulation, and their refinement is vital for improving both the quality and controllability of AI-generated images.},

Using a between-subjects experiment, we exposed 100 verified Pop Mart consumers to either AI-curated or self-selected product sets across 20 usage scenarios and 100 SKUs. AI recommendations reduced IP selection by 46 percentage points, elevated scenario-congruent items to top rank, and cut composite satisfaction by 0.5 points despite faster choices. The findings reveal that scenario tags supplant brand salience as the dominant cue and uncover an efficiency–affect trade-off inherent in algorithmic curation. We contribute a parsimonious model of AI-driven loyalty erosion and provide actionable guidance for hybrid recommender architectures.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a dynamic public opinion risk assessment algorithm based on generative AI and multimodal sentiment analysis, aiming to solve the problem of insufficient utilization of multimodal information and difficulty in dynamically capturing risk evolution in traditional public opinion risk assessment methods. The algorithm first collects and preprocesses multimodal public opinion data such as text, images, videos, and audio, and then extracts the features of each modality. Through the designed multimodal feature dynamic fusion mechanism, the weights are adjusted in real time according to the impact of different modalities on sentiment and risk, and then combined with the Transformer-based generative model to predict the evolution trend of public opinion risk, and finally realize dynamic public opinion risk assessment. The experimental simulation uses CMU-MOSI, MOSEI datasets and multimodal public opinion data in specific fields. The results show that in terms of sentiment analysis, the algorithm in this paper has an accuracy of 89.2\%, precision of 88.5\%, recall of 89.0\%, and F1 value of 88.7\% on the CMU-MOSI dataset, and an accuracy of 87.8\%, precision of 87.0\%, recall of 88.2\%, and F1 value of 87.6\% on the MOSEI dataset, which is an average increase of 3.5\%-5.2\% over the accuracy of the comparison algorithm; in public opinion risk assessment, the risk prediction accuracy is 85.6\%, MAE is 0.12, and RMSE is 0.15, which is 4.8\%-6.3\% higher than the comparison method, and MAE and RMSE are reduced by 0.03-0.05 and 0.04-0.06 respectively. The algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy and timeliness of dynamic public opinion risk assessment.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, the Metaverse has emerged as a new digital space. Under this perspective, advertising creativity has ushered in unprecedented changes and opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) empowers advertising creativity in the context of meta-universe and promotes its innovation and development. This study constructs a theoretical model with the AI participation effect as the independent variable, consumer perception as the mediator variable, and advertising expectation as the dependent variable to explore the specific influence mechanism of AI-enabled advertising creativity. Meanwhile, the XGBoost algorithm was used to construct a classification model. After data cleaning, standardization, and dividing the dataset into training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio, parameters were optimized by combining 5-fold cross-validation. The model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and precision, and SHAP was employed to analyze feature importance. The results of the study show that the better the AI participation effect, the higher the consumer perception, and the better the advertising expectation, also consumer perception plays a mediating role between the AI participation effect and advertising expectation. On this basis, the new situation of future advertising creativity is proposed, namely, the polarization and dynamic generation of personalized ads, the paradigm change of intelligent creative production, and the intelligent placement and scenario expansion of ads.},

abstract = {Chinese martial arts are deeply rooted in the traditional culture of the Chinese nation. Throughout its historical development, it has accumulated a profound historical heritage and formed its unique cultural value. The technological innovation of generative artificial intelligence provides a new path for the modernization transformation of Chinese martial arts culture. This study proposes a framework for Chinese martial arts cultural products based on generative artificial intelligence and multimodal interaction. By combining deep learning models (such as GANs, Transformers) with blockchain and AR/VR technology, five applications were designed: technology-enabled martial arts digital products, martial arts interactive short videos, martial arts motion capture systems, martial arts education platforms, and martial arts virtual experience halls. These applications were evaluated and validated from the dimensions of user experience and market potential. Experimental results show that martial arts cultural products under generative artificial intelligence and multimodal interaction have good user experience and positive market prospects, providing theoretical and practical reference for the deep integration of martial arts culture and intelligent technology.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence are poised to reshape introductory programming education, challenging conventional teaching methodologies. This paper presents a scoping review that explores the current understanding of integrating generative artificial intelligence tools in the learning of introductory programming. Through an analysis of 28 selected studies, this review provides a snapshot of the landscape in mid-2024, presenting benefits, concerns, and recommendations surrounding the use of generative artificial intelligence within programming education. It finds insufficient guidance on how to implement recommended pedagogical strategies, limited consideration of student perceptions and experiences, and a predominance of short study time frames. Additionally, there is a significant research gap in second-level education, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The paper discusses how these gaps signal a need for more human-centered approaches in the current research. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, aiming to inspire further inquiry and advance the understanding of generative artificial intelligence’s role in programming education from a human-centered perspective.},

With the help of experimental analysis of the 2024 RetailRocket dataset, this paper explores the effects of three recommendation strategies: collaborative filtering, popular recommendations, and content recommendations. It also analyzes the impact of two display styles, image and text, on user behavior. Personalized image and text recommendations are most effective in improving click-through rate and conversion rate. User characteristics such as gender, age, and device type play an important role in regulating recommendation acceptance. The system relies on a real-time feedback mechanism and combines online updates to continuously improve recommendation results, upgrade user experience, and promote the commercial conversion rate of e-commerce platforms. The research provides a theoretical basis for the optimization of the recommendation system and provides effective guidance for the personalized marketing tactics of actual e-commerce platforms.},

This submission presents a systematic review of 95 case studies, 64 in education, 14 in arts, and 17 in heritage — selected via a PRISMA-guided search and expert screening — to map how generative artificial intelligence is embedded at both the interface and interaction levels. We identify nine interface archetypes (e.g., conversational, adaptive dashboards, immersive environments interfaces), eight interaction patterns (e.g., conversing, collaborating, manipulating),and eight main user experience dimensions as observed in case studies. Our analysis further categorizes six modality-usage patterns—from text, image, audio, and video up to fully multi-modal workflows and distillsfour main categories of end-to-end application pipelines. Notably, only two studies were found to articulate design-phase guidelines, and limitations cluster around output quality, ethical risks, and a lack of longitudinal evaluations. We conclude with limitations observed and future research focused on explainability, participatory design, and sustained field deployments. This synthesis provides a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness generative artificial intelligence as a responsive, human-centered collaborator.},

This paper takes the course of “Java Framework Application “in software technology major as the research object, discusses how to empower the traditional teaching mode through AIGC technology, and improve the teaching quality and practical effect of the course. Firstly, the pain points existing in the current Java framework course teaching were analyzed, including the shortage of case resources, the single practice scene, and the lack of personalized guidance. Secondly, combined with the technical characteristics of AIGC, a multi-dimensional application model covering code generation, intelligent question answering, scene simulation and learning effect evaluation was constructed. By introducing a large language model to automatically generate customized case codes of mainstream frameworks such as Spring Boot and MyBatis, conversational AI is used to assist students to solve development problems in real time, and a virtual project scene is constructed based on generative technology to strengthen engineering practice ability. Teaching practice shows that the application of AIGC technology greatly improves students 'code standardization and project development efficiency, and teachers can accurately locate learning weaknesses through intelligent analysis tools. This study provides a reusable implementation path for the intelligent transformation of technology courses, and verifies the empowering value of generative artificial intelligence in the field of vocational education, which has important reference significance for the optimization of future curriculum system.},

A decision-making simulation based on human-computer collaboration has been constructed and is being used to evaluate the actual effect of generative artificial intelligence on enhancing students' dynamic decision-making ability and innovative thinking. Controlled experiments revealed that learners in the experimental group using AI-assisted teaching performed significantly better than the control group in terms of dynamic decision-making ability and innovative thinking. Eighty-eight per cent of learners in the experimental group believed that AI had effectively improved their decision-making efficiency and ability. However, 35 per cent of learners also showed an over-reliance on AI technology during the process of using it. Based on these findings, it is recommended that teaching focuses on developing critical thinking skills when using AI to assist learning.},

The study reports the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autocoders (VAE) in artistic style extraction from a large number of datasets and generating innovative images with regional cultural features. The study draws from cultural anthropology's "Three Elements of Culture Theory" in examining the material, organizational and spiritual dimensions. The study identifies three methods of cultural translation: direct translation, consecutive translation, and indirect translation. The study utilizes these frameworks in examining innovative solutions to expressing Henan's regional culture in modern cultural products. It demonstrates how to achieve cultural dissemination and inheritance and enhance cultural identity and global influence in the context of globalization. The study also examines the potential of AI-based image generation in cultural creative design, thus offering a new framework for perceiving and examining the role of computer technology in cultural translation and innovation.},

GAEs have specialized domain expertise, perform tasks within bounded autonomy, include a synthetic persona and possess multimodal generative AI capabilities, among other features. We provide a definition of GAEs which includes seven defining traits, offering a taxonomy which sets them apart from other generative AI systems. We use literature-review based conceptual analysis with abductive reasoning to propose the new concept that addresses identified limitations in existing systems. The paper explores the emergence of GAEs as a leap from expert systems. We name two enablers for GAEs - ongoing development of a research field of human-AI collaboration and growing capabilities of generative artificial intelligence systems. We discuss existing generative AI agents, noting that GAEs as such do not exist yet, but are starting to emerge. Due conceptual nature of this paper we do not explore the technical aspects of GAEs development. Instead, we use illustrative examples to present possible applications of GAEs and their potential role in the future of knowledge work. This article appears in the AI \&amp; Society track.},

It is important to investigate how special education teachers perceive and use GAI for two distinct instructional tasks: instructional enrichment and accommodations. Although the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been extensively used to study technology adoption, its application to GAI in special education is underrepresented. This gap is critical as special education teachers must address diverse needs of students with multiple disabilities. Moreover, limited research had examined how TAM dimensions vary across different tasks. This late-breaking study revealed that teachers consistently rated GAI lower for accommodations across all TAM dimensions, with particularly differences in Intention to Use and Actual Use. The results highlighted the complexities of adopting GAI for distinct instructional purposes. Although GAI demonstrated potential for supporting instructional enrichment, its inability to generate individualized recommendations limited its effectiveness for accommodations.},

abstract = {In the contemporary flourishing digital economy, advancements in artificial intelligence are incessantly reconfiguring the capital market landscape. This study commences with the industry perturbation instigated by the DeepSeek large - model to explore the interactive mechanisms between financial public opinion and capital markets during technological innovation events. Through the comprehensive utilization of methods such as literature review, case analysis, social network analysis, and regression analysis, and drawing on 12,329 Weibo public opinion data points and high - frequency trading data from 16 A - share DeepSeek concept stocks, a novel “technology decoding – market response” dual - path model is constructed. The study reveals that technology - related public opinion gradually infiltrates the financial domain via a three - stage progression: “professional decoding – industry restructuring – investment decision - making.” Technology bloggers assume a pivotal role in information dissemination, as evidenced by an intermediary centrality of 0.29. The data further indicate that for each one - standard - deviation increment in public opinion intensity, the excess return of concept stocks surges by 1.8\% after 36 hours (p = 0.03), whereas the impact of sentiment polarity on stock prices is not statistically significant (β = 0.04, p = 0.41).Adopting an integrated perspective from journalism and behavioral finance, this research elucidates the propagation patterns of technology - related public opinion and its inherent connections with capital markets, and it formulates a “technology–finance” public opinion governance framework. These findings provide crucial theoretical underpinnings and practical guidelines for the prevention of financial risks associated with technology - related public opinion, thereby having far - reaching implications for optimizing financial market regulation and enhancing public opinion management systems.},

abstract = {Students often do not fully understand the code they have written. This sometimes does not become evident until later in their education, which can mean it is harder to fix their incorrect knowledge or misunderstandings. In addition, being able to fully understand code is increasingly important in a world where students have access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as GitHub Copilot. One effective solution is to utilise code comprehension questions, where a marker asks questions about a submission to gauge understanding, this can also have the side effect of helping to detect plagiarism. However, this approach is time consuming and can be difficult and/or expensive to scale. This paper introduces AutoMCQ, which uses GenAI for the automatic generation of multiple-choice code comprehension questions. This is integrated with the CodeRunner automated assessment platform.},

This paper presents a novel framework for adaptive optimization of advertising creative visual elements using multi-dimensional user behavior data. Our approach integrates real-time behavioral analytics with computer vision techniques to automatically adjust visual components including color schemes, layout structures, typography, and imagery. The methodology employs a data-driven adaptive algorithm that continuously learns from user interactions across multiple touchpoints, enabling dynamic personalization of creative elements. Experimental validation on a dataset comprising 50,000 advertising campaigns demonstrates significant improvements in click-through rates (23.7\% increase) and user engagement metrics (31.2\% improvement) compared to conventional static optimization methods. The framework addresses critical challenges in scalable personalization while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time deployment.},

The variable scales involved in the experiments were mature scales, and ANOVA and the process in SPSS were used for testing.Findings–Study 1 indicates that followers react negatively to influencers' adoption of GenAI for social media production, which is mitigated when influencers engage in honesty-based motive explanation disclosure. Study 2 reveals that influencer motive attribution and perceived influencers' authenticity play chain-mediated roles in the effects of GenAI's adoption of disclosure type on followers' attitudes and behaviors.Originality/value–First, this study extends the GenAI marketing literature, which is still in its infancy, to provide a novel idea and framework for studying social media content creation by GenAI. Second, this study draws on the literature in the field of sponsored disclosure to further demonstrate the potential effectiveness of similar motive explanation for this approach.},

abstract = {The increasing ubiquity of web-based generative artificial intelligence technologies necessitates that all students experience teaming with such technologies -- exploring their strengths and limitations and learning how to create synergy with them. To aid in this effort, we designed an open-ended generative AI project for the freshmen taking our general-education introduction to computing course. Students were required to team with generative AI to create something beyond what they alone (or the AI alone) could accomplish. Upon completion, students submitted a short written critical analysis documenting their experiences and presented a three-minute demonstration of their project in class. Despite limited course coverage of AI and generative AI prior to this project, we were impressed by the creativity and sophistication of the submitted final products as well as the breadth of generative AI tools explored. Student reflections on the experience illustrated numerous insights into the strengths and limitations of the tools they employed. Our results underscore that students can learn about the benefits and limitations of generative AI in as little as a single assignment and that covering such topics need not require extensive amounts of course time and resources.},

It puts forward a journey from March 2023 to January 2025; the researcher (as artist/artist as a researcher) examines how generative artificial intelligence tools, including ChatGPT and MidJourney, reignited a passion for looser (imperfect) art practice. This process led to self-scrutiny through self-portrait that bridges personal and research. While generative artificial intelligence ignited creativity, it brought authenticity, originality, and tensions with ethics. These concerns are addressed through themes such as attribution transparency, the ethics of relying on non-human solutions and balancing inspiration versus imitation. The pictorial shares extracts from a two-year digital sketchbook that reflects how GAI can support artists in times of crisis and contributes to broader conversations about GAI's role in art practice. It invites readers to consider the evolving relationship between artists and GAI in shaping the future of art practice.},

We propose an innovative semantic information-theoretic framework, introducing semantic entropy, mutual information, channel capacity, and rate-distortion concepts specifically adapted to multimedia applications. This framework redefines multimedia communication from purely syntactic data transmission to semantic information conveyance. We further highlight future opportunities and critical research directions. We chart a path toward robust, efficient, and semantically meaningful multimedia communication systems by bridging generative AI innovations with information theory. This exploratory paper aims to inspire a semantic-first paradigm shift, offering a fresh perspective with significant implications for future multimedia research.},

The research indicates that concerns regarding data privacy and legal compliance often create discomfort among users, which in turn reduces their satisfaction levels. Additionally, the study highlights a strong demand for platform reasonable risk point alerts and user support, emphasizing the importance of enhancing user trust when promoting AI contract generation technologies. Although this study has limitations, including a small sample size and potential self-report bias, it provides a new perspective for understanding the relationship between risk perception and user satisfaction. Based on the findings, it is recommended that future research adopt diverse sampling methods and qualitative approaches to gain deeper insights into this field, considering the characteristics and needs of different user groups. Ultimately, establishing more transparent communication mechanisms and providing effective user support will be key strategies for enhancing user satisfaction, thereby facilitating the broader application and long-term development of AI technologies within the legal domain.},

However, current GAN architectures exhibit limitations in feature fusion efficiency, synthesized image quality, and classification accuracy. In this study, a GAN-based multimodal medical image generation and classification model was constructed. First, features are extracted using multi-scale receptive fields, key channels are enhanced by combining the channel attention mechanism, and the cross-enhanced fusion module realizes the fusion of MRI and PET features. In addition, Generator 3D is responsible for generating realistic medical images and classifying diseases through the classification header. Discriminator 3D is used to discriminate the realism of the images. Meanwhile, a comprehensive loss function is designed to optimize the generator's performance by combining adversarial loss, correlation loss, mean loss, and classification loss. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality medical images and perform well on the classification task. It effectively improves the performance of medical image analysis and provides strong support for clinical diagnosis.},
