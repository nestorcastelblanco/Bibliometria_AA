abstract = {With the increasing complexity and diversity of network attacks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been employed to address network intrusion detection challenges. However, the performance of these models is constrained by their reliance on a single graph construction approach. To enhance detection accuracy and adaptability to intricate attack patterns, this paper introduces a Multi-Granularity Graph Fusion-based Graph Neural Network (MGF-GNN) model. The model resolves the issue of a single granularity graph structure failing to fully capture the complex relationships and covert attack strategies in network traffic. It constructs three heterogeneous graphs at different granularities to capture traffic relationships from host-level, port-level, and protocol-level perspectives. The model employs hierarchical message passing, aggregation, and cross-graph information fusion mechanisms to strengthen its ability to learn multi-level information, thereby improving detection performance against complex attacks. MGF-GNN outperforms traditional machine learning methods and single-graph-based GNN models on the CIC-IDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 datasets, achieving significant improvements across multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Its effectiveness is primarily attributed to MGF-GNN's ability to comprehensively learn multi-dimensional perspective information through multi-granularity graph fusion.},

Inspired by adversarial learning, this paper focuses on Chinese character input scenarios and propose an effective attack strategy to generate more valuable training examples in these scenarios. This strategy jointly utilizes the attention mechanism and the logit output to determine the attack position and generates misspelling instances in a perturbed pinyin manner. The generated adversarial samples are then gradually added to the training set to train the model. Further, this paper explores the effect of the proportion of samples in the adversarial training process on model performance. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy are demonstrated on three different architectural baseline models.},

By using gated slot attention, GC-DMRec focuses on critical time points, extracting more representative features while reducing noise.

However, our framework aims to preserve the large language model generation capability while focusing on the implicit relationships in configurations. By introducing a hierarchical command graph, we follow a top-down matching to generate templates, reducing feedback interactions in generation and bring potential solutions for automated provisioning. We process template generation under different scenarios, including establishing BGP basic connections on multiple routers and imposing restrictions such as route redistribution at specific locations. Human involvement is restricted to providing critical information. Experiment shows that expected templates can be generated in the first iteration, particularly for the basic task. The advanced task is influenced by multiple factors, however, it still shows considerable potential in terms of coverage with possibly feasible templates.},

First, the Aprior algorithm is used to mine strong association rules from the user authority relationship to reveal the potential relationship between resources. Then, the user rights relationship is enhanced, resource similarity is calculated, and collaborative filtering is used to generate recommended values for unauthorized resources. Finally, the access control policy is classified and authorized according to the recommended value, and the automatic generation of the policy is realized. The experimental results show that this method can not only generate access control policies automatically, but also assign new permissions effectively and ensure the privacy of resource data.},

abstract = {As deep learning technology in computer science develops, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has shown great potential in automated essay scoring (AES). Prompts and time are important factors which may influence the performance of GenAI. The study selected 52 English argumentative essays, designed five different prompts, chooses two different time points, and then utilized ChatGPT 4 to explore the effects of prompts and time on AES by GenAI. Besides, possible reasons for large difference between human and GenAI score were discussed.For different prompts, results show that the one-shot prompt performs better in AES compared with the other four prompts. It provides background information and a scoring example to ChatGPT. The scores generated by it do not significantly differ from the human scores. They significantly and positively correlate with human scores (ρ = 0.424). The exact-plus-adjacent agreement (EPAA) rate for one-shot prompt scores reaches 69.23\%. For scores generated at different points in time, results reveal that although there is still a significant difference between scores generated after one week and human scores, the ChatGPT-Human EPAA rate becomes higher and the absolute value of mean score difference is smaller.Based on the analysis of selected essays, the major reason for large GenAI-Human score difference is that ChatGPT evaluates essays from limited perspectives to give its score, while human raters can comprehensively assess the quality of an essay. What's more, ChatGPT cannot keep the same scoring criteria during the rating process.The study aims to help people understand how to interact with GenAI more efficiently and take advantage of GenAI to meet the practical needs.},

Each agent's dynamic is described by a high-order differential equation, which includes time delays and uncertainty. A novel fully distributed adaptive control method is proposed to ensure that all following agents track the leader with prescribed scaled ratios asymptotically, and the tracking errors are uniform ultimate boundedness. Meantime the proposed approach guarantees the bounded adaptive estimates of the unknown parameters and dynamics, and can lighten the burden on computation because it only needs to update a small number of adaptive parameters. The control gain of each agent is heterogeneous and time-varying. It changes and updates by the designed distributed adaptive law. The presented protocol doesn't need to know global nonzero eigenvalues of communication graph adjacency matrix, and is independent of any global information. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is verified by a numerical example.},

abstract = {Regular network traffic prediction techniques, which generally rely on data normalization, often fail to account for the non-stable characteristics of network traffic, leading to a decline in estimate reliability. A novel approach to this problem is the Trend Decomposition Enhanced Large Language Model for Non-Static Network Traffic Prediction (TD-LLM). Applying trend decomposition as the preparation approach, the proposed strategy first divides raw information into resolved and non-fixed parts. The predetermined portion is standardized and processed, implementing a multi-head cross-attention mechanism, while a better self-attention mechanism improves the non-stationary element. Prompt engineering is used to create specially designed causes that serve as a guideline for the design throughout the forecast process. Finally, the processed data and creates are integrated into the large language model to produce the predicted results. In contrast to foundation models like Time- LLM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer, the TD-LLM type drastically reduces mean squared error for network traffic prediction across many regions, according to exploratory evaluations, with decreases of 19.73 \%, 54.71 \%, 76.88 \%, and 61.48 \%, respectively.},

In this research, we propose a method that combines the most renowned Chinese anthology, the “Siku Quanshu,” with generative pre-trained models. We developed the SikuGPT model, a generative model for ancient text processing tasks, based on GPT-type language models by continued pretraining. This model was tested on two typical tasks of ancient text processing: translation between classical and modern Chinese, and classification of ancient texts. The findings reveal that our model achieves advantages in understanding and generating scenarios of ancient texts.

Survivability testing is usually implemented by simulating real hacker attacks, but this kind of testing and evaluation method depends on the professional level of testers to a large extent. There are problems such as incomplete testing and low testing efficiency. This paper comprehensively utilizes the ATT&amp;CK (Adversarial Tactics, Technologies, and Common Knowledge) and D3FEND (Defensive Tactics, Technologies, and Common Knowledge) frameworks of MITRE, aiming to propose a new cybersecurity survivability testing technology. Through in-depth analysis of the attack tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in the ATT&amp;CK framework, combined with the defense strategies and measures in the D3FEND framework, this paper designs a cybersecurity survivability evaluation program. This scheme not only evaluates the protection, detection, response and recovery capabilities of the system against network attacks, but also provides a scientific and perfect defense measures for the system. The case study further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and shows how to conduct survivability testing against attacks on the Linux operating system.

abstract = {The use of mobile phone APP meter reading reduces the probability of human intervention and misidentification, but due to the complex location and geographical conditions of the buried water meter, as well as the base code and gear in the water meter dial, there are problems of low accuracy and rough segmentation results when the water meter word wheel region is divided, so a YOLO v8 segmentation method based on coordinate attention mechanism is proposed. The backbone network incorporates the AM (Attention-MobileNet_block) module to apply the Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism, which facilitates the extraction of multi-scale features, reduces model parameters and computational complexity, and enhances computing efficiency. In the feature fusion stage, the C2f_CA mechanism, based on the Bottleneck_CA module, effectively mitigates background interference while concentrating on the water meter's target region. Experimental results indicate that, compared to other segmentation models, our model achieves an F1-score of 98.61\% and a mean Pixel Accuracy (mPA) of 99.11\% for word wheel region segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the precise identification of water meter code words in the future.},

abstract = {At present, network security becomes more and more important, but the security vulnerability data in various databases are relatively dispersed and it is difficult to establish the connection between them, network security knowledge graph can associate the security vulnerability data of different databases together, and it can be updated in real time with the latest security vulnerabilities. This paper establishes network security knowledge graph based on CAPEC, CWE and other security libraries. Aiming at the problem that TransR model cannot utilize entity semantic information, TransR-Roberta model is proposed, and splicing layer, attention layer and convolutional layer are added on the basis of TransR model. And for the problem that the quality of negative samples generated by Bernoulli negative sampling is too low, a clustering-based negative sampling optimization method is proposed. Firstly, the clustering task is accomplished with the help of Gaussian hybrid clustering algorithm on the entities in the security vulnerability knowledge graph to label the entities with clusters. In the next step, the clustered vulnerability entities are reclassified using support vector machine. Finally, a classifier combined with Facolloss function is added to the loss function of the TransR model, which is used to improve the ability of the knowledge inference model to distinguish between positive and negative samples. The experimental results show that the improved model improves the hit@N, MR and MMR metrics for the knowledge reasoning task.},

abstract = {As the scale of agricultural production continues to expand, plant diseases have become a major threat to global agricultural productivity. Although traditional disease detection methods are widely used, they generally suffer from low accuracy and complex operations, making them difficult to meet the needs of modern agriculture. In response to these problems, this article proposes a new deep learning model-LabInt. LabInt uses dual-branch independent convolution in Lab color space, which effectively reduces the impact of illumination changes on feature extraction. Through spatial reconstruction and multi-scale pooling technology, the model can deeply mine shallow disease features and use deep convolution instead of ordinary convolution to reduce computational costs and improve the model's fine-grained identification capabilities. In addition, in order to adapt to complex agricultural environments, LabInt introduces a multi-head self-attention (MHA) mechanism to dynamically enhance attention to disease characteristics and significantly reduce the interference of complex backgrounds. Experimental results show that LabInt exhibits excellent disease recognition performance in actual agricultural production environments, with key indicators such as precision and recall reaching high levels. Ablation studies show that each module makes an important contribution to model performance. Therefore, LabInt is not only innovative in theory, but also shows strong application potential in practice, and is expected to become an important tool to improve the efficiency of agricultural disease prevention and control.},

The experimental results of DAT-YOLO on the VisDrone dataset show that with a 57.5\% reduction in parameter count, the mAP@50 and the mAP@50:95 has also increased by 6.7\% and 5.0\% respectively, making it suitable for drone target detection tasks.},

abstract = {Aiming at the problem of large differences in feature information between different targets in remote sensing images and the complexity of the scene, an improved SwinIR Transformer remote sensing image super-resolution reconstruction algorithm is proposed, combining residual hybrid attention and spatial-gate feed-forward network. First, a new residual hybrid attention module (RHAB) is constructed, which is serially combined with multiple self-attention (MSA) to enhance feature extraction by mixing channel attention (CA), spatial attention (SA), and MSA, and to improve the model's ability in modeling locally and globally relevant information. Second, a spatial-gate feed-forward network (SGFN) is used instead of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) in the original network to effectively reduce redundant channel information, overcome the limitations of the MLP in dealing with local spatial features, and enhance the feature expression efficiency. The experiments use NWPU-RESISC45 and UCMerced_LandUse as the training set, RSOD-Dataset, RSSCN7 Data Set, and WHU-RS19 Data Set as the test set, and the model performance is evaluated by PSNR and SSIM metrics. The experimental results confirm that the model in this paper shows excellent performance in both objective evaluation and subjective visualization.},

First, the SCConv module is utilized to combine with the C2f module in the YOLOv8 backbone network to construct the C2fSC module, which enhances the feature extraction capability of the model while reducing the computational complexity. Second, the SPPF module is integrated with the BAM attention mechanism to weaken the influence of background interference. Finally, WIoU is used to replace the original loss function to optimize the positioning accuracy of the bounding box and enhance the overall performance of the model. The experimental results show that compared with the original YOLOv8 model, the improved model improves 4.9\%, 4.2\%, and 4.4\% in P, R, and mAP metrics, respectively, and the number of parameters and FLOPs are only 2.8M and 7.7G, which proves that the improved model has excellent robustness and effectiveness.},

Firstly, three layers of image features are extracted by the feature pyramid; secondly, the edge detection module extracts the edge features of the input image and feature map; then, the features are fused by adaptive feature fusion and attentional feature fusion; finally, correlation is computed layer-by-layer using the fused features to estimate the homography. In this paper, experiments have been conducted to verify the method's effectiveness by calculating the PSNR and SSIM metrics. Experimental results show that this method can estimate homography more accurately than other related methods when stitching large baseline images.},

Traditional contact-based measurement methods face significant limitations in high temperature and extreme environments, such as safety risks, inaccurate measurements due to interference with the environment, and short equipment life. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative non-contact measurement method using a visual depth estimation technique based on deep learning. The MiDaS model captures an image of a liquid metal surface by a monocular camera in an industrial environment. A deep neural network then estimates their depth by processing these images. By calculating the vertical distance between the liquid metal level point and a predefined reference point, real-time and accurate monitoring of the liquid level height is realized. This study not only introduces a new non-contact solution for measuring the height of liquid metal surfaces, but also enhances the potential applications of deep learning in industrial vision measurement and depth estimation.},

The nature of different families and classes of malware images is imbalanced, which leads to a challenging issue of biased classification, where the majority classes dominate the model's performance. Attention is drawn to generative artificial intelligence, in which a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to synthesize more training samples (particularly in minority classes). A more balanced dataset can reduce biased classification towards the majority class. However, a robust GAN model usually requires high computing power and a lot of epochs. In this paper, we aim to design a lightweight GAN model to enhance the performance of malware image classification in imbalanced datasets. Performance evaluation and analysis show that it enhances the model's accuracy and reduces its training time. Future research directions are also shared.},

Through a Non-Western community-centered approach and grounded theory analysis of 5 focus groups from diverse Indian subcultures, we explore how T2I outputs to English input prompts depict Indian culture and its subcultures, uncovering novel representational harms such as exoticism and cultural misappropriation. These findings highlight the urgent need for inclusive and culturally sensitive T2I systems. We propose design guidelines informed by a sociotechnical perspective, contributing to the development of more equitable and representative GAI technologies globally. Our work underscores the necessity of adopting a community-centered approach to comprehend the sociotechnical dynamics of these models, complementing existing work in this space while identifying and addressing the potential negative repercussions and harms that may arise as these models are deployed on a global scale.},

This paper explores the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in technology sovereignty, its contributions, and benefits for the government, associated risks, and challenges, and how it influences government policies. It begins with examining GAI's capabilities to comprehend how it understands natural language, trains on existing data, and generates realistic outputs, followed by a discussion of its potential benefits for governments that enable them to act independently and autonomously in diverse sectors. It highlights how it can empower them to administer technological ecosystems, promote domestic innovation, and facilitate policy-making processes. However, contrary to its benefits, GAI is also capable of inflicting negative consequences on society. Therefore, the paper also addresses the risks and challenges associated with GAI that necessitate reflection on existing policies and developing new ones that align with a nation's legal frameworks. Exploring the influence of GAI on government policies, the paper highlights the significance of collaboration in policy-making endeavors to ensure ethical future developments and bring value to public interest and democratic values. This comprehensive analysis aims to shed light on the responsible and ethical use of GAI to preserve human rights, promote economic growth, sustain social justice, and inform the responsible use of GAI within the framework of technology sovereignty.},

We used ChatGPT, a GAI-based tool, and conducted an eight-week mixed-methods study involving 23 computer science undergraduate students. The study involved applying four distinct projects extracted from GitHub, where participants were tasked with identifying code smells and performing the necessary refactoring to improve code quality. The primary focus was on identifying both the positive and negative aspects of the method, as well as delineating the computational thinking characteristics developed during the process. The results indicate that the use of ChatGPT facilitated the learning of refactoring, contributing to the development of numerous computational thinking skills, especially problem formulation, decomposition, and abstraction. Thus, this paper contributes a GAI-based teaching method along with evidence on how it helps students develop refactoring skills.},

abstract = {The systematic testing of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models by collaborative teams and distributed individuals, often called red-teaming, is a core part of the infrastructure that ensures that AI models do not produce harmful content. Unlike past technologies, the black box nature of generative AI systems necessitates a uniquely interactional mode of testing, one in which individuals on red teams actively interact with the system, leveraging natural language to simulate malicious actors and solicit harmful outputs. This interactional labor done by red teams can result in mental health harms that are uniquely tied to the adversarial engagement strategies necessary to effectively red team. The importance of ensuring that generative AI models do not propagate societal or individual harm is widely recognized—one less visible foundation of end-to-end AI safety is also the protection of the mental health and wellbeing of those who work to keep model outputs safe. In this paper, we argue that the unmet mental health needs of AI red-teamers are a critical workplace safety concern. Through analyzing the unique mental health impacts associated with the labor done by red teams, we propose potential individual and organizational strategies that could be used to meet these needs, and safeguard the mental health of red-teamers. We develop our proposed strategies through drawing parallels between common red-teaming practices and interactional labor common to other professions (including actors, mental health professionals, conflict photographers, and content moderators), describing how individuals and organizations within these professional spaces safeguard their mental health given similar psychological demands. Drawing on these protective practices, we describe how safeguards could be adapted for the distinct mental health challenges experienced by red teaming organizations as they mitigate emerging technological risks on the new digital frontlines.

Through an investigation of interviews with Pell grant eligible college students at open access colleges, we address the following research questions: How do low-income undergraduate interview participants describe their uses of and attitudes regarding generative AI tool use for academic purposes? and What elements of AI digital literacy appear to be accessible to interview participants, based on their descriptive statements?},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) systems have experienced exponential growth in the last couple of years. These systems offer exciting capabilities for CS Education (CSEd), such as generating programs, that students can well utilize for their learning. Among the many dimensions that might affect the effective adoption of GenAI for CSEd, in this paper, we investigate students' trust. Trust in GenAI influences the extent to which students adopt GenAI, in turn affecting their learning. In this paper, we present results from a survey of 253 students at two large universities to understand how much they trust GenAI tools and their feedback on how GenAI impacts their performance in CS courses. Our results show that students have different levels of trust in GenAI. We also observe different levels of confidence and motivation, highlighting the need for further understanding of factors impacting trust.},

The rising number of conversational queries on such platforms now emits as much CO2 as everyday activities, leading to an exponential growth of energy consumption and underscoring urgent sustainability challenges. This short paper introduces an energy-aware LLM-based video processing tool. Employing open-source LLM models and techniques like fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this tool recommends video processing commands and executes them in an energy-aware manner. Preliminary results show that it achieves reduced energy consumption per prompt compared to baselines.},

abstract = {The widespread use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, has come along with multiple benefits in education (e.g., 24h teacher, augmenting student monitoring). However, at the same time, these tools hinder teachers’ autonomy, limiting the capacity and freedom to exert control over students’ actions and their learning process. Additionally, the generic character of the GenAI output usually lacks contextualization (e.g., course curriculum, students’ age), thus hampering the successful attainment of the course goals. To address these issues, this paper proposes the development of a system mediating between the GenAI interfaces and their back-ends. This system allows teachers to monitor the students’ interactions and align the given answers with the course learning objectives and teaching methods. This research follows the Systems Development Research methodology, and within the first iteration, we developed a system prototype that was evaluated with 8 secondary-school teachers. Results showed a high perceived usefulness of the system for monitoring students’ interactions; for alerting the teachers to take specific actions (e.g., suspicious copy-paste behaviours), and for having control over the GenAI outputs. Additionally, while most teachers perceived a higher autonomy level within the given scenarios, some teachers did not. The evaluation also served to collect further requirements and usability features to keep improving the tool in the next methodological iterations.},

However, educators have raised ethical concerns, particularly regarding the adverse effect on students' learning if students simply parrot generative AI-generated content without engaging in critical analysis or original thought. Moreover, there exists the potential of generative AI to perpetuate existing biases in training data. This editorial discusses three major concerns in generative AI use in education and proposes questions (on task-AI fit and people-AI fit) and approaches to address the ethical considerations by adopting five principles of AI ethics. The editorial also discusses developing a classroom AI use policy as one governance mechanism for promoting ethical use of AI. As generative AI technology continues to evolve, so must our educational practices. The editorial ends with a call for readers (educators) to collaboratively define the terms of engagement with generative AI in educational settings and to begin this discourse by sharing insights and experiences with promoting ethical use of generative AI.},

In particular, we will discuss three types of applications, namely, RL as an alternative way for generation without specified objectives; as a way for generating outputs while concurrently maximizing an objective function; and, finally, as a way of embedding desired characteristics, which cannot be easily captured by means of an objective function, into the generative process.

However, granular and real-time data on labor market trends are lacking; publicly available data from survey samples are released with significant lags and miss critical information such as skills and benefits. We use generative Artificial Intelligence to automatically extract structured labor market information from unstructured online job postings for the entire U.S. labor market. To demonstrate our methodology, we construct a sample of 6,800 job postings stratified by 68 major occupational groups, extract structured information on educational requirements, remote-work flexibility, full-time availability, and benefits, and show how these job characteristics vary across occupations. As a validation, we compare frequencies of educational requirements by occupation from our sample to survey data and find no statistically significant difference. Finally, we discuss the scalability to collections of millions of job postings. Our results establish the feasibility of measuring labor market trends at scale from online job postings thanks to advances in generative AI techniques. Improved access to such insights at scale and in real-time could transform the ability of policy leaders, including federal and state agencies and education providers, to make data-informed decisions that better support the American workforce.},

Descriptive and lag sequential analysis methods were employed to examine the characteristics and patterns of students' information behavior according to Ellis' model of information seeking. The results indicated that although students frequently used generative AI tools as primary information sources, they also sought additional resources to satisfy their informational needs. Additionally, students sometimes copied and pasted useful information from generative AI tools into group documents to share with their group members. Lag sequential analysis revealed that students typically began their information seeking process with generative AI tools, followed by exploring additional information sources.},

abstract = {For decades, scholars have emphasized that tasks should be the central focus in Information Retrieval (IR). This point of view holds even more significance with the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, which can, among other capabilities, understand natural language, engage in dialog with users, generate bespoke user interfaces, and power agents to help complete tasks. GenAI presents an unprecedented opportunity to finally realize the potential of tasks in IR, enhance task-focused retrieval and interaction, and create ''magical'' task completion moments for users. In this paper, we explore the rationale and methodology behind this argument. Traditional IR systems support mostly simple tasks. The emergence of GenAI creates an opportunity for IR systems to help users achieve complex tasks and for the IR community to rekindle its interest and demonstrate leadership in this sizable and significant problem space. We underscore the pivotal role of tasks in IR and introduce new evidence supporting the notion that task-centric approaches, abstracted from specific modalities, represent the future of IR. Building on this foundation, we envision the development, utilization, and evaluation of next-generation IR systems. We propose a promising future where IR agents prioritize users, their tasks, and their situations. However, despite their potential to address task-focused and modality-independent IR, agents alone are insufficient. We propose a robust ecosystem around these agents that transcends traditional queries, questions, prompts, and modalities to address users' fundamental needs, tasks, and goals.},

Given the widespread use of this tool and the lack of knowledge over how it can support learning, there is a need for educators to have a framework for using it in the classroom and teaching their students usage strategies that are beneficial for learning. One pathway forward is through creativity, a process crucial for learning and also connected to the act of using gen-AI. This poster demonstrates the results of a study designed to provide an in-depth view on how creativity intersects with gen-AI usage in a computational physics course. In the course, students learn about computing tools during group-based, open-ended computational physics activities. Students are often tasked with using gen-AI to explore and help make decisions. The findings demonstrate a connection between using gen-AI and engaging in creative processes, and the implications point to strategies for supporting student usage of gen-AI.},

abstract = {CG (Computer Graphics) is a popular field of CS (Computer Science), but many students find this topic difficult due to it requiring a large number of skills, such as mathematics, programming, geometric reasoning, and creativity. Over the past few years, researchers have investigated ways to harness the power of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) to improve teaching. In CS, much of the research has focused on introductory computing. A recent study evaluating the performance of an LLM (Large Language Model), GPT-4 (text-only), on CG questions, indicated poor performance and reliance on detailed descriptions of image content, which often required considerable insight from the user to return reasonable results. So far, no studies have investigated the abilities of LMMs (Large Multimodal Models), or multimodal LLMs, to solve CG questions and how these abilities can be used to improve teaching.In this study, we construct two datasets of CG questions requiring varying degrees of visual perception skills and geometric reasoning skills, and evaluate the current state-of-the-art LMM, GPT-4o, on the two datasets. We find that although GPT-4o exhibits great potential in solving questions with visual information independently, major limitations still exist to the accuracy and quality of the generated results. We propose several novel approaches for CG educators to incorporate GenAI into CG teaching despite these limitations. We hope that our guidelines further encourage learning and engagement in CG classrooms.},

abstract = {With the increasing complexity and diversity of network attacks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been employed to address network intrusion detection challenges. However, the performance of these models is constrained by their reliance on a single graph construction approach. To enhance detection accuracy and adaptability to intricate attack patterns, this paper introduces a Multi-Granularity Graph Fusion-based Graph Neural Network (MGF-GNN) model. The model resolves the issue of a single granularity graph structure failing to fully capture the complex relationships and covert attack strategies in network traffic. It constructs three heterogeneous graphs at different granularities to capture traffic relationships from host-level, port-level, and protocol-level perspectives. The model employs hierarchical message passing, aggregation, and cross-graph information fusion mechanisms to strengthen its ability to learn multi-level information, thereby improving detection performance against complex attacks. MGF-GNN outperforms traditional machine learning methods and single-graph-based GNN models on the CIC-IDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 datasets, achieving significant improvements across multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Its effectiveness is primarily attributed to MGF-GNN's ability to comprehensively learn multi-dimensional perspective information through multi-granularity graph fusion.},

By integrating quantization into the MPC protocols, PPQformer significantly reduces memory footprint and enhances computational performance while preserving data and model privacy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive accuracies with reduced communication cost and inference time compared to existing methods.},

Subsequently, the spectra of 79 important wavelengths obtained by CARS algorithm was reconstructed by proposed lightweight SSR model at the optimal number of input channels. The model built by partial least squares (PLS) and reconstructed spectra is used to predict the SSC of pears with a Rp2 of 0.668 and EMSEp of 0.366. The experimental results show that increasing the input channels can improve the reconstruction quality of the SSR model, and the reasonable selection of output channels helps to remove the redundant information and realize the accurate prediction of SSC, which illustrated that the importance of rationally selecting the input channels of the SSR model as well as the output channels to the SSR results.},

Inspired by adversarial learning, this paper focuses on Chinese character input scenarios and propose an effective attack strategy to generate more valuable training examples in these scenarios. This strategy jointly utilizes the attention mechanism and the logit output to determine the attack position and generates misspelling instances in a perturbed pinyin manner. The generated adversarial samples are then gradually added to the training set to train the model. Further, this paper explores the effect of the proportion of samples in the adversarial training process on model performance. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy are demonstrated on three different architectural baseline models.},

This model combines global context with gated slot attention mechanisms, effectively integrating local session graphs with global context graphs to track item changes both within and across sessions. By using gated slot attention, GC-DMRec focuses on critical time points, extracting more representative features while reducing noise. Experimental results on datasets such as Diginetica, Tmall, and Nowplaying demonstrate that GC-DMRec outperforms other existing methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.},

We do not rule out the contribution of validators to property-specific consistency. However, our framework aims to preserve the large language model generation capability while focusing on the implicit relationships in configurations. By introducing a hierarchical command graph, we follow a top-down matching to generate templates, reducing feedback interactions in generation and bring potential solutions for automated provisioning. We process template generation under different scenarios, including establishing BGP basic connections on multiple routers and imposing restrictions such as route redistribution at specific locations. Human involvement is restricted to providing critical information. Experiment shows that expected templates can be generated in the first iteration, particularly for the basic task. The advanced task is influenced by multiple factors, however, it still shows considerable potential in terms of coverage with possibly feasible templates.},

First, the Aprior algorithm is used to mine strong association rules from the user authority relationship to reveal the potential relationship between resources. Then, the user rights relationship is enhanced, resource similarity is calculated, and collaborative filtering is used to generate recommended values for unauthorized resources. Finally, the access control policy is classified and authorized according to the recommended value, and the automatic generation of the policy is realized. The experimental results show that this method can not only generate access control policies automatically, but also assign new permissions effectively and ensure the privacy of resource data.},

abstract = {As deep learning technology in computer science develops, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has shown great potential in automated essay scoring (AES). Prompts and time are important factors which may influence the performance of GenAI. The study selected 52 English argumentative essays, designed five different prompts, chooses two different time points, and then utilized ChatGPT 4 to explore the effects of prompts and time on AES by GenAI. Besides, possible reasons for large difference between human and GenAI score were discussed.For different prompts, results show that the one-shot prompt performs better in AES compared with the other four prompts. It provides background information and a scoring example to ChatGPT. The scores generated by it do not significantly differ from the human scores. They significantly and positively correlate with human scores (ρ = 0.424). The exact-plus-adjacent agreement (EPAA) rate for one-shot prompt scores reaches 69.23\%. For scores generated at different points in time, results reveal that although there is still a significant difference between scores generated after one week and human scores, the ChatGPT-Human EPAA rate becomes higher and the absolute value of mean score difference is smaller.Based on the analysis of selected essays, the major reason for large GenAI-Human score difference is that ChatGPT evaluates essays from limited perspectives to give its score, while human raters can comprehensively assess the quality of an essay. What's more, ChatGPT cannot keep the same scoring criteria during the rating process.The study aims to help people understand how to interact with GenAI more efficiently and take advantage of GenAI to meet the practical needs.},

Each agent's dynamic is described by a high-order differential equation, which includes time delays and uncertainty. A novel fully distributed adaptive control method is proposed to ensure that all following agents track the leader with prescribed scaled ratios asymptotically, and the tracking errors are uniform ultimate boundedness. Meantime the proposed approach guarantees the bounded adaptive estimates of the unknown parameters and dynamics, and can lighten the burden on computation because it only needs to update a small number of adaptive parameters. The control gain of each agent is heterogeneous and time-varying. It changes and updates by the designed distributed adaptive law. The presented protocol doesn't need to know global nonzero eigenvalues of communication graph adjacency matrix, and is independent of any global information. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is verified by a numerical example.},

abstract = {Regular network traffic prediction techniques, which generally rely on data normalization, often fail to account for the non-stable characteristics of network traffic, leading to a decline in estimate reliability. A novel approach to this problem is the Trend Decomposition Enhanced Large Language Model for Non-Static Network Traffic Prediction (TD-LLM). Applying trend decomposition as the preparation approach, the proposed strategy first divides raw information into resolved and non-fixed parts. The predetermined portion is standardized and processed, implementing a multi-head cross-attention mechanism, while a better self-attention mechanism improves the non-stationary element. Prompt engineering is used to create specially designed causes that serve as a guideline for the design throughout the forecast process. Finally, the processed data and creates are integrated into the large language model to produce the predicted results. In contrast to foundation models like Time- LLM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer, the TD-LLM type drastically reduces mean squared error for network traffic prediction across many regions, according to exploratory evaluations, with decreases of 19.73 \%, 54.71 \%, 76.88 \%, and 61.48 \%, respectively.},

The integration of generative pre-trained models with Chinese ancient texts, a vital carrier of Chinese culture, allows for deep mining of the content of these texts and provides services that make ancient texts more understandable and accessible to the general public. In this research, we propose a method that combines the most renowned Chinese anthology, the “Siku Quanshu,” with generative pre-trained models. We developed the SikuGPT model, a generative model for ancient text processing tasks, based on GPT-type language models by continued pretraining. This model was tested on two typical tasks of ancient text processing: translation between classical and modern Chinese, and classification of ancient texts. The findings reveal that our model achieves advantages in understanding and generating scenarios of ancient texts. The capability of SikuGPT in processing traditional Chinese texts helps to promote the organization of ancient information and knowledge services, and advances the international dissemination of traditional Chinese culture.},

abstract = {In the context of the continuous evolution of current network threats, organizations urgently need advanced cybersecurity defense strategies to deal with complex and changeable network attacks. Survivability testing is usually implemented by simulating real hacker attacks, but this kind of testing and evaluation method depends on the professional level of testers to a large extent. There are problems such as incomplete testing and low testing efficiency. This paper comprehensively utilizes the ATT&amp;CK (Adversarial Tactics, Technologies, and Common Knowledge) and D3FEND (Defensive Tactics, Technologies, and Common Knowledge) frameworks of MITRE, aiming to propose a new cybersecurity survivability testing technology. Through in-depth analysis of the attack tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in the ATT&amp;CK framework, combined with the defense strategies and measures in the D3FEND framework, this paper designs a cybersecurity survivability evaluation program. This scheme not only evaluates the protection, detection, response and recovery capabilities of the system against network attacks, but also provides a scientific and perfect defense measures for the system. The case study further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and shows how to conduct survivability testing against attacks on the Linux operating system. This study provides a new perspective and practical guidance for the development of cybersecurity defense technology.},

abstract = {The use of mobile phone APP meter reading reduces the probability of human intervention and misidentification, but due to the complex location and geographical conditions of the buried water meter, as well as the base code and gear in the water meter dial, there are problems of low accuracy and rough segmentation results when the water meter word wheel region is divided, so a YOLO v8 segmentation method based on coordinate attention mechanism is proposed. The backbone network incorporates the AM (Attention-MobileNet_block) module to apply the Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism, which facilitates the extraction of multi-scale features, reduces model parameters and computational complexity, and enhances computing efficiency. In the feature fusion stage, the C2f_CA mechanism, based on the Bottleneck_CA module, effectively mitigates background interference while concentrating on the water meter's target region. Experimental results indicate that, compared to other segmentation models, our model achieves an F1-score of 98.61\% and a mean Pixel Accuracy (mPA) of 99.11\% for word wheel region segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the precise identification of water meter code words in the future.},

abstract = {At present, network security becomes more and more important, but the security vulnerability data in various databases are relatively dispersed and it is difficult to establish the connection between them, network security knowledge graph can associate the security vulnerability data of different databases together, and it can be updated in real time with the latest security vulnerabilities. This paper establishes network security knowledge graph based on CAPEC, CWE and other security libraries. Aiming at the problem that TransR model cannot utilize entity semantic information, TransR-Roberta model is proposed, and splicing layer, attention layer and convolutional layer are added on the basis of TransR model. And for the problem that the quality of negative samples generated by Bernoulli negative sampling is too low, a clustering-based negative sampling optimization method is proposed. Firstly, the clustering task is accomplished with the help of Gaussian hybrid clustering algorithm on the entities in the security vulnerability knowledge graph to label the entities with clusters. In the next step, the clustered vulnerability entities are reclassified using support vector machine. Finally, a classifier combined with Facolloss function is added to the loss function of the TransR model, which is used to improve the ability of the knowledge inference model to distinguish between positive and negative samples. The experimental results show that the improved model improves the hit@N, MR and MMR metrics for the knowledge reasoning task.},

abstract = {As the scale of agricultural production continues to expand, plant diseases have become a major threat to global agricultural productivity. Although traditional disease detection methods are widely used, they generally suffer from low accuracy and complex operations, making them difficult to meet the needs of modern agriculture. In response to these problems, this article proposes a new deep learning model-LabInt. LabInt uses dual-branch independent convolution in Lab color space, which effectively reduces the impact of illumination changes on feature extraction. Through spatial reconstruction and multi-scale pooling technology, the model can deeply mine shallow disease features and use deep convolution instead of ordinary convolution to reduce computational costs and improve the model's fine-grained identification capabilities. In addition, in order to adapt to complex agricultural environments, LabInt introduces a multi-head self-attention (MHA) mechanism to dynamically enhance attention to disease characteristics and significantly reduce the interference of complex backgrounds. Experimental results show that LabInt exhibits excellent disease recognition performance in actual agricultural production environments, with key indicators such as precision and recall reaching high levels. Ablation studies show that each module makes an important contribution to model performance. Therefore, LabInt is not only innovative in theory, but also shows strong application potential in practice, and is expected to become an important tool to improve the efficiency of agricultural disease prevention and control.},

abstract = {Aiming at the problem of large differences in feature information between different targets in remote sensing images and the complexity of the scene, an improved SwinIR Transformer remote sensing image super-resolution reconstruction algorithm is proposed, combining residual hybrid attention and spatial-gate feed-forward network. First, a new residual hybrid attention module (RHAB) is constructed, which is serially combined with multiple self-attention (MSA) to enhance feature extraction by mixing channel attention (CA), spatial attention (SA), and MSA, and to improve the model's ability in modeling locally and globally relevant information. Second, a spatial-gate feed-forward network (SGFN) is used instead of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) in the original network to effectively reduce redundant channel information, overcome the limitations of the MLP in dealing with local spatial features, and enhance the feature expression efficiency. The experiments use NWPU-RESISC45 and UCMerced_LandUse as the training set, RSOD-Dataset, RSSCN7 Data Set, and WHU-RS19 Data Set as the test set, and the model performance is evaluated by PSNR and SSIM metrics. The experimental results confirm that the model in this paper shows excellent performance in both objective evaluation and subjective visualization.},

To this end, this paper proposes the CapABSA model, which takes sensitive words as aspects, combines capsule neural networks to capture multidimensional semantic features, and migrates document-based sentiment analysis (DBSA) to ABSA through transfer learning to improve classification performance. Experiments show that the model performs effectively in sentence datasets containing sensitive words, providing a more fine-grained solution for sensitive information filtering.},

Firstly, three layers of image features are extracted by the feature pyramid; secondly, the edge detection module extracts the edge features of the input image and feature map; then, the features are fused by adaptive feature fusion and attentional feature fusion; finally, correlation is computed layer-by-layer using the fused features to estimate the homography. In this paper, experiments have been conducted to verify the method's effectiveness by calculating the PSNR and SSIM metrics. Experimental results show that this method can estimate homography more accurately than other related methods when stitching large baseline images.},

To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative non-contact measurement method using a visual depth estimation technique based on deep learning. The MiDaS model captures an image of a liquid metal surface by a monocular camera in an industrial environment. A deep neural network then estimates their depth by processing these images. By calculating the vertical distance between the liquid metal level point and a predefined reference point, real-time and accurate monitoring of the liquid level height is realized. This study not only introduces a new non-contact solution for measuring the height of liquid metal surfaces, but also enhances the potential applications of deep learning in industrial vision measurement and depth estimation.},

The nature of different families and classes of malware images is imbalanced, which leads to a challenging issue of biased classification, where the majority classes dominate the model's performance. Attention is drawn to generative artificial intelligence, in which a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to synthesize more training samples (particularly in minority classes). A more balanced dataset can reduce biased classification towards the majority class. However, a robust GAN model usually requires high computing power and a lot of epochs. In this paper, we aim to design a lightweight GAN model to enhance the performance of malware image classification in imbalanced datasets. Performance evaluation and analysis show that it enhances the model's accuracy and reduces its training time. Future research directions are also shared.},

Despite the transformative potential of T2Is in content creation, concerns have arisen regarding biases that may lead to misrepresentations and marginalizations. Through a Non-Western community-centered approach and grounded theory analysis of 5 focus groups from diverse Indian subcultures, we explore how T2I outputs to English input prompts depict Indian culture and its subcultures, uncovering novel representational harms such as exoticism and cultural misappropriation. These findings highlight the urgent need for inclusive and culturally sensitive T2I systems. We propose design guidelines informed by a sociotechnical perspective, contributing to the development of more equitable and representative GAI technologies globally. Our work underscores the necessity of adopting a community-centered approach to comprehend the sociotechnical dynamics of these models, complementing existing work in this space while identifying and addressing the potential negative repercussions and harms that may arise as these models are deployed on a global scale.},

abstract = {As a result of the prominence of generative artificial intelligence across diverse fields, it has become necessary for governments to develop national strategies for directing the ethical use of artificial intelligence to respect fundamental human values. This paper explores the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in technology sovereignty, its contributions, and benefits for the government, associated risks, and challenges, and how it influences government policies. It begins with examining GAI's capabilities to comprehend how it understands natural language, trains on existing data, and generates realistic outputs, followed by a discussion of its potential benefits for governments that enable them to act independently and autonomously in diverse sectors. It highlights how it can empower them to administer technological ecosystems, promote domestic innovation, and facilitate policy-making processes. However, contrary to its benefits, GAI is also capable of inflicting negative consequences on society. Therefore, the paper also addresses the risks and challenges associated with GAI that necessitate reflection on existing policies and developing new ones that align with a nation's legal frameworks. Exploring the influence of GAI on government policies, the paper highlights the significance of collaboration in policy-making endeavors to ensure ethical future developments and bring value to public interest and democratic values. This comprehensive analysis aims to shed light on the responsible and ethical use of GAI to preserve human rights, promote economic growth, sustain social justice, and inform the responsible use of GAI within the framework of technology sovereignty.},

abstract = {With the widespread adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, ethical issues are being raised around the disclosure of their use in publishing, journalism, or artwork. Recent research has found that college students are increasingly using GenAI tools; however, we know less about when, why, and how they choose to hide or disclose their use of GenAI in academic work. To address this gap, we conducted an online survey (n=97) and interviews with fifteen college students followed by interviews with nine teachers who had experience with students’ undisclosed use of GenAI. Our findings elucidate the strategies students employ to hide their GenAI use and their justifications for doing so, alongside the strategies teachers follow to manage such non-disclosure. We unpack students’ non-disclosure of GenAI through the lens of cognitive dissonance and discuss practical considerations for teachers and students regarding ways to promote transparency in GenAI use in higher education.},

abstract = {Refactoring presents a complex computational challenge, and its learning is intricate, requiring a solid foundation in computational thinking, programming and object-oriented concepts. Moreover, making students realize the importance and benefits of refactoring is also challenging. To address this complexity, we introduce a refactoring teaching method based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), incorporating single-loop and double-loop learning principles, focusing on fostering deeper and critical learning. We used ChatGPT, a GAI-based tool, and conducted an eight-week mixed-methods study involving 23 computer science undergraduate students. The study involved applying four distinct projects extracted from GitHub, where participants were tasked with identifying code smells and performing the necessary refactoring to improve code quality. The primary focus was on identifying both the positive and negative aspects of the method, as well as delineating the computational thinking characteristics developed during the process. The results indicate that the use of ChatGPT facilitated the learning of refactoring, contributing to the development of numerous computational thinking skills, especially problem formulation, decomposition, and abstraction. Thus, this paper contributes a GAI-based teaching method along with evidence on how it helps students develop refactoring skills.},

abstract = {The systematic testing of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models by collaborative teams and distributed individuals, often called red-teaming, is a core part of the infrastructure that ensures that AI models do not produce harmful content. Unlike past technologies, the black box nature of generative AI systems necessitates a uniquely interactional mode of testing, one in which individuals on red teams actively interact with the system, leveraging natural language to simulate malicious actors and solicit harmful outputs. This interactional labor done by red teams can result in mental health harms that are uniquely tied to the adversarial engagement strategies necessary to effectively red team. The importance of ensuring that generative AI models do not propagate societal or individual harm is widely recognized—one less visible foundation of end-to-end AI safety is also the protection of the mental health and wellbeing of those who work to keep model outputs safe. In this paper, we argue that the unmet mental health needs of AI red-teamers are a critical workplace safety concern. Through analyzing the unique mental health impacts associated with the labor done by red teams, we propose potential individual and organizational strategies that could be used to meet these needs, and safeguard the mental health of red-teamers. We develop our proposed strategies through drawing parallels between common red-teaming practices and interactional labor common to other professions (including actors, mental health professionals, conflict photographers, and content moderators), describing how individuals and organizations within these professional spaces safeguard their mental health given similar psychological demands. Drawing on these protective practices, we describe how safeguards could be adapted for the distinct mental health challenges experienced by red teaming organizations as they mitigate emerging technological risks on the new digital frontlines. Note: This work includes descriptions of violence, trauma, and mental illness.},

These systems offer exciting capabilities for CS Education (CSEd), such as generating programs, that students can well utilize for their learning. Among the many dimensions that might affect the effective adoption of GenAI for CSEd, in this paper, we investigate students' trust. Trust in GenAI influences the extent to which students adopt GenAI, in turn affecting their learning. In this paper, we present results from a survey of 253 students at two large universities to understand how much they trust GenAI tools and their feedback on how GenAI impacts their performance in CS courses. Our results show that students have different levels of trust in GenAI. We also observe different levels of confidence and motivation, highlighting the need for further understanding of factors impacting trust.},

The rising number of conversational queries on such platforms now emits as much CO2 as everyday activities, leading to an exponential growth of energy consumption and underscoring urgent sustainability challenges. This short paper introduces an energy-aware LLM-based video processing tool. Employing open-source LLM models and techniques like fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this tool recommends video processing commands and executes them in an energy-aware manner. Preliminary results show that it achieves reduced energy consumption per prompt compared to baselines.},

abstract = {The widespread use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, has come along with multiple benefits in education (e.g., 24h teacher, augmenting student monitoring). However, at the same time, these tools hinder teachers’ autonomy, limiting the capacity and freedom to exert control over students’ actions and their learning process. Additionally, the generic character of the GenAI output usually lacks contextualization (e.g., course curriculum, students’ age), thus hampering the successful attainment of the course goals. To address these issues, this paper proposes the development of a system mediating between the GenAI interfaces and their back-ends. This system allows teachers to monitor the students’ interactions and align the given answers with the course learning objectives and teaching methods. This research follows the Systems Development Research methodology, and within the first iteration, we developed a system prototype that was evaluated with 8 secondary-school teachers. Results showed a high perceived usefulness of the system for monitoring students’ interactions; for alerting the teachers to take specific actions (e.g., suspicious copy-paste behaviours), and for having control over the GenAI outputs. Additionally, while most teachers perceived a higher autonomy level within the given scenarios, some teachers did not. The evaluation also served to collect further requirements and usability features to keep improving the tool in the next methodological iterations.},

However, educators have raised ethical concerns, particularly regarding the adverse effect on students' learning if students simply parrot generative AI-generated content without engaging in critical analysis or original thought. Moreover, there exists the potential of generative AI to perpetuate existing biases in training data. This editorial discusses three major concerns in generative AI use in education and proposes questions (on task-AI fit and people-AI fit) and approaches to address the ethical considerations by adopting five principles of AI ethics. The editorial also discusses developing a classroom AI use policy as one governance mechanism for promoting ethical use of AI. As generative AI technology continues to evolve, so must our educational practices. The editorial ends with a call for readers (educators) to collaboratively define the terms of engagement with generative AI in educational settings and to begin this discourse by sharing insights and experiences with promoting ethical use of generative AI.},

However, granular and real-time data on labor market trends are lacking; publicly available data from survey samples are released with significant lags and miss critical information such as skills and benefits. We use generative Artificial Intelligence to automatically extract structured labor market information from unstructured online job postings for the entire U.S. labor market. To demonstrate our methodology, we construct a sample of 6,800 job postings stratified by 68 major occupational groups, extract structured information on educational requirements, remote-work flexibility, full-time availability, and benefits, and show how these job characteristics vary across occupations. As a validation, we compare frequencies of educational requirements by occupation from our sample to survey data and find no statistically significant difference. Finally, we discuss the scalability to collections of millions of job postings. Our results establish the feasibility of measuring labor market trends at scale from online job postings thanks to advances in generative AI techniques. Improved access to such insights at scale and in real-time could transform the ability of policy leaders, including federal and state agencies and education providers, to make data-informed decisions that better support the American workforce.},

Descriptive and lag sequential analysis methods were employed to examine the characteristics and patterns of students' information behavior according to Ellis' model of information seeking. The results indicated that although students frequently used generative AI tools as primary information sources, they also sought additional resources to satisfy their informational needs. Additionally, students sometimes copied and pasted useful information from generative AI tools into group documents to share with their group members.

abstract = {For decades, scholars have emphasized that tasks should be the central focus in Information Retrieval (IR). This point of view holds even more significance with the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, which can, among other capabilities, understand natural language, engage in dialog with users, generate bespoke user interfaces, and power agents to help complete tasks. GenAI presents an unprecedented opportunity to finally realize the potential of tasks in IR, enhance task-focused retrieval and interaction, and create ''magical'' task completion moments for users. In this paper, we explore the rationale and methodology behind this argument. Traditional IR systems support mostly simple tasks. The emergence of GenAI creates an opportunity for IR systems to help users achieve complex tasks and for the IR community to rekindle its interest and demonstrate leadership in this sizable and significant problem space. We underscore the pivotal role of tasks in IR and introduce new evidence supporting the notion that task-centric approaches, abstracted from specific modalities, represent the future of IR. Building on this foundation, we envision the development, utilization, and evaluation of next-generation IR systems. We propose a promising future where IR agents prioritize users, their tasks, and their situations. However, despite their potential to address task-focused and modality-independent IR, agents alone are insufficient. We propose a robust ecosystem around these agents that transcends traditional queries, questions, prompts, and modalities to address users' fundamental needs, tasks, and goals.},

Given the widespread use of this tool and the lack of knowledge over how it can support learning, there is a need for educators to have a framework for using it in the classroom and teaching their students usage strategies that are beneficial for learning. One pathway forward is through creativity, a process crucial for learning and also connected to the act of using gen-AI. This poster demonstrates the results of a study designed to provide an in-depth view on how creativity intersects with gen-AI usage in a computational physics course. In the course, students learn about computing tools during group-based, open-ended computational physics activities. Students are often tasked with using gen-AI to explore and help make decisions. The findings demonstrate a connection between using gen-AI and engaging in creative processes, and the implications point to strategies for supporting student usage of gen-AI.},

abstract = {Deep learning is a critical goal of education in the 21st century, and metacognitive scaffolding plays a very key auxiliary role in achieving this goal. To exceed the limitations of traditional teaching scaffolds that lacked customization, they developed a dynamic scaffold framework based on metacognitive theory and generative artificial intelligence technology. Its structure is mainly composed of behavioral examination research, creative dialogue exchanges, and responses to self-awareness. On the Coze platform, users can build an intelligent agent, select a "three-person voting setup" and a "four-person quiz setup" scenario, and then conduct educational exercises. The results showed that this structure enabled learners to perform superior in goal setting, strategy application, and reflective standard, which shows that self-awareness assistance using general artificial intelligence is indeed very promising in helping people to gain deeper understanding.},

abstract = {2025 marks a period of an explosive growth for generative artificial intelligence, and further accelerating the informatization of education. In this way, personalized learning is becoming increasingly possible. However, the true implementation of personalized learning relies on the technical support of online learning platforms for differentiated instruction. This study examines the limitations of the Chaoxing Learning Platform, such as uniform content delivery, incomplete learner profiling, manual task scheduling, and standardized evaluation which effectively hinder differentiated instruction. Through system modeling and functional analysis, this paper proposes a five-layer architectural optimization framework including Data Layer, Learner Profile Layer, Recommendation Layer, Task Scheduling Layer, Evaluation Layer in order to enhance the platform's adaptability to diverse learning needs.},

abstract = {CG (Computer Graphics) is a popular field of CS (Computer Science), but many students find this topic difficult due to it requiring a large number of skills, such as mathematics, programming, geometric reasoning, and creativity. Over the past few years, researchers have investigated ways to harness the power of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) to improve teaching. In CS, much of the research has focused on introductory computing. A recent study evaluating the performance of an LLM (Large Language Model), GPT-4 (text-only), on CG questions, indicated poor performance and reliance on detailed descriptions of image content, which often required considerable insight from the user to return reasonable results. So far, no studies have investigated the abilities of LMMs (Large Multimodal Models), or multimodal LLMs, to solve CG questions and how these abilities can be used to improve teaching.In this study, we construct two datasets of CG questions requiring varying degrees of visual perception skills and geometric reasoning skills, and evaluate the current state-of-the-art LMM, GPT-4o, on the two datasets. We find that although GPT-4o exhibits great potential in solving questions with visual information independently, major limitations still exist to the accuracy and quality of the generated results. We propose several novel approaches for CG educators to incorporate GenAI into CG teaching despite these limitations. We hope that our guidelines further encourage learning and engagement in CG classrooms.},
