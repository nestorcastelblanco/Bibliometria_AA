  abstract = {Collective intelligence (CI) is an interdisciplinary field that draws on a wide range of academic disciplines but has struggled to capitalise on cross-pollination between fields, particularly ones which do not self-identify with the collective intelligence label. Past studies have largely undertaken a qualitative and manual approach to classifying different trends in the CI literature. This method risks missing a significant proportion of publications in the field. To this end, we present the first attempt to reflect the field to itself through an automated and quantitative descriptive approach using Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to collect and analyse 39,334 CI papers. We further focus our investigation on a subset of the CI literature, at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and CI to understand how these two fields are interacting. We show that while the annual number of CI-only publications has remained steady since 2015, AI+CI research has continued to increase. Publications in the crossover of AI+CI are growing at a faster rate than CI-only papers but show less topical and disciplinary breadth. This may be having a spillover effect on the topical focus of non-AI collective intelligence research. We hope this analysis sheds more light on the dynamics of the CI ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Often suffering from under-optimization, Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) heavily impact the efficiency of domain-specific Systems-on-Chip. To cope with this issue, heterogeneous NoCs are promising alternatives. Nevertheless, the design of optimized NoCs satisfying multiple performance objectives is extremely challenging and requires significant expertise. Prior works failed to combine many objectives or required an extended design space exploration time. In this paper, we propose an approach based on generative artificial intelligence to help pruning complex design spaces for heterogeneous NoCs, according to configurable performance objectives. This is made possible by the ability of Generative Adversarial Networks to learn and generate relevant design candidates for the target NoCs. The speed and flexibility of our solution enable a fast generation of optimized NoCs that fit users' expectations. Through some experiments, we show how to obtain competitive NoC designs reducing the power consumption with no communication performance or area penalty compared to a given conventional NoC design.},

  abstract = {Concrete is the most widely used engineered material in the world with more than 10 billion tons produced annually. Unfortunately, with that scale comes a significant burden in terms of energy, water, and release of greenhouse gases and other pollutants; indeed 8\% of worldwide carbon emissions are attributed to the production of cement, a key ingredient in concrete. As such, there is interest in creating concrete formulas that minimize this environmental burden, while satisfying engineering performance requirements including compressive strength. Specifically for computing, concrete is a major ingredient in the construction of data centers. In this work, we use conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs), a type of semi-supervised generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, to discover concrete formulas with desired properties. Our model is trained just using a small open dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository joined with environmental impact data from standard lifecycle analysis. Computational predictions demonstrate CVAEs can design concrete formulas with much lower carbon requirements than existing formulations while meeting design requirements. Next we report laboratory-based compressive strength experiments for five AI-generated formulations, which demonstrate that the formulations exceed design requirements. The resulting formulations were then used by Ozinga Ready Mix—a concrete supplier—to generate field-ready concrete formulations, based on local conditions and their expertise in concrete design. Finally, we report on how these formulations were used in the construction of buildings and structures in a Meta data center in DeKalb, IL, USA. Results from field experiments as part of this real-world deployment corroborate the efficacy of AI-generated low-carbon concrete mixes.},

  abstract = {This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. It is time to convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) can generate text virtually indistinguishable from text written by humans. A key question, then, is whether people believe news headlines generated by AI as much as news headlines generated by humans. AI is viewed as lacking human motives and emotions, suggesting that people might view news written by AI as more accurate. By contrast, two pre-registered experiments on representative U.S. samples (N = 4,034) showed that people rated news headlines written by AI as less accurate than those written by humans. People were more likely to incorrectly rate news headlines written by AI (vs. a human) as inaccurate when they were actually true, and more likely to correctly rate them as inaccurate when they were indeed false. Our findings are important given the increasing adoption of AI in news generation, and the associated ethical and governance pressures to disclose it use and address standards of transparency and accountability.},

However, although we know that AI in general poses both risks and opportunities for people with disabilities, little is known specifically about GAI in particular. To address this, we conducted a three-month autoethnography of our use of GAI to meet personal and professional needs as a team of researchers with and without disabilities. Our findings demonstrate a wide variety of potential accessibility-related uses for GAI while also highlighting concerns around verifiability, training data, ableism, and false promises.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing a crucial role both in the technological advances and emerging advanced threats in cybersecurity. Despite efforts by competent authorities in Europe to regulate the use of AI in a way that aligns with the ethics and individuals’ fundamental rights, there are still challenges to be tackled, not to mention the malicious use of AI by cybercriminals. In this paper we present a novel framework that is composed of innovative cybersecurity services that leverage AI to provide support in the management of the incident response and recovery lifecycle of the critical entities’ systems against advanced attacks. The paper describes the main components and architecture of the AI4CYBER framework and provides a clear understanding of the application of the autonomous intelligent cybersecurity services and their role in enforcing defensive actions throughout the entire lifecycle of the systems.},

  abstract = {Recently, generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have experienced an incredible surge in interest and use. The proliferation of these technologies suggests that it would be prudent to raise awareness of the potential consequences of irresponsible use of these models. Indeed, to achieve trustworthy AI solutions, it is essential to promote AI education as a fundamental step. Educating people to use AI responsibly not only improves their understanding of the technology, but also equips them to address issues of bias and discrimination. Indeed, informed users are more likely to recognize when AI is producing biased or discriminatory results and to demand appropriate solutions. This awareness of the ethical implications of AI decisions is crucial for the responsible and socially conscious adoption of AI. The aim of this poster is to report the results obtained as a final thesis work, pursued within the context of the Human-Centred AI Masters (HCAIM) programme in Naples, focused on the analysis of users’ perceptions of biases in media created by generative AI models.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented interest in developing Deep Learning methodologies for the generation of images and image sequences that are hardly distinguishable to the human eye from real ones. A major issue in this field is how the generation can be easily controlled. In this talk we will focus on some of our recent works in generative models that are primarily aimed at controllable generation. We will first present unsupervised methods for learning non-linear paths in the latent spaces of Generative Adversarial Networks such that following different paths lead to different types of changes (e.g., removing the background, changing head poses, or facial expressions) in the resulting images&nbsp;[4]. Subsequently, we will present a method that allows local editing by finding a Parts and Appearances decomposition in the GAN latent space&nbsp;[2]. Then, we will present recent works on reenactment&nbsp;[1], where the goal is to transfer the facial activity (pose, expressions, speech) of a certain person to another one, and recent works in which supervision for generation comes from language models&nbsp;[3]. Finally, we will touch on the technical challenges ahead, as well on the challenges that this creates in spreading misinformation.},

  abstract = {Despite the fact that artificial intelligence (AI) has existed for many years, for the first time it managed to attract the attention of the mainstream media. Since the release of the chatbot system "ChatGPT" by OpenAI in November 2022 the hype and interest in AI has increased significantly, not only in research but also among the general public. As a result, the question arises which specific application areas and target groups can benefit from artificial intelligence in the future. This article provides an overview of the use of artificial intelligence in creating accessibility. For this purpose, various aspects are considered on how AI technologies can contribute to removing barriers for people with disabilities and enable them to participate equally in social life. The aim of this paper is to highlight the potentials and challenges of uniting AI and accessibility. It discusses the contribution that artificial intelligence can make to closing the gap between technology and accessibility. Finally, a concept idea for the creation of a new kind of accessibility, the so-called Accessibility 2.0, is proposed.},

Incorporating model-based approaches for understanding human emotion regulation, it seeks to enhance the user-vehicle interaction. A unique aspect of this workshop is the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the design process. The workshop will explore generative AI’s potential in crafting contextual responses and its impact on user experience and interface design. The agenda includes brainstorming on various driving scenarios, developing emotion-oriented intervention methods, and rapid prototyping with AI tools. The anticipated outcome includes practical prototypes of affective user interfaces and insights on the role of AI in designing human-machine interactions. Through this workshop, we hope to contribute to making automated driving more accessible and enjoyable.},

  abstract = {The field of generative artificial intelligence has seen significant advancements in recent years with the advent of large language models, which have shown impressive results in software engineering tasks but not yet in engineering user interfaces. Thus, we raise a specific research question: would an LLM-based system be able to search for relevant GUI layouts? To address this question, we conducted a controlled study evaluating how Instigator, an LLM-based system for searching GUI layouts of web pages by generative pre-trained training, would return GUI layouts that are relevant to a given instruction and what would be the user experience of (N =34) practitioners interacting with Instigator. Our results identify a very high similarity and a moderate correlation between the rankings of the GUI layouts generated by Instigator and the rankings of the practitioners with respect to their relevance to a given design instruction. We highlight the results obtained through thirteen UEQ+ scales that characterize the user experience of the practitioner with Instigator, which we use to discuss perspectives for improving such future tools.},

  abstract = {This article aims to explore the consistency between a few popular generative AI robots in the evaluation of e-learning platforms. The three robots adopted in the study were GPT-4, Sage, and Dragonfly, which were requested to award rating scores to the six major dimensions, namely (1) features and capabilities, (2) ease of use and customization, (3) cost, (4) security, (5) customer support, and (6) scalability, of 10 to 20 currently most popular e-learning platforms. For each of the three robots, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the rating scores for each of the six dimensions were computed across all the e-learning platforms. The rating score difference for each of the six dimensions between any pair of robots was calculated for each platform. The mean of the absolute value, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the differences for each dimensions between each pair of robots were calculated across all platforms. Finally, a Cronbach alpha coefficient of the rating scores was computed for each of the six dimensions between all the three robots across all the e-learning platforms. The computational results were to reveal whether the three robots accorded discrimination in evaluating each dimension across the platforms and whether there was consistency between the three robots in evaluating each dimension across the platforms. Among some auxiliary results, it was found that the evaluation by the three robots was severely inconsistent for the two dimensions cost and security, inconsistent to a lesser extent for the dimension scalability, and consistent for the remaining three dimensions.},

Moreover, developments in generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in education, are gaining prominence, yet we do not understand its value or how best to implement it in post-primary educational settings. Despite a growing international body of research in this area, my scoping review highlights that many aspects of these topics have yet to be explored, particularly in the context of post-primary students in Ireland. My study will begin to bridge this gap by exploring how a purposeful sample of LCCS post-primary students in Ireland engage with GAI tools, such as ChatGPT, during their initial experiences learning Python programming. These findings, when approached through the lens of Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence (HCAI), can help enhance pedagogical strategies and lead to improved learning experiences for students.},

  abstract = {The application of pretrained language models in real-world business domains has gained significant attention. However, research on the practical use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to address real-world downstream tasks is limited. This study aims to enhance the routine tasks of customer service (CS) representatives, particularly in the finance domain, by applying a fine-tuning method to dialogue summarization in CS centers. KakaoBank handles an average of 15,000 CS calls daily. By employing a fine-tuning method using real-world CS dialogue data, we can reduce the time required to summarize CS dialogues and standardize summarization skills. To ensure effective dialogue summarization in the finance domain, pretrained language models should acquire additional knowledge and skills, such as specific knowledge of financial products, problem-solving abilities, and the capacity to handle emotionally charged customers. In this study, we developed a reference fine-tuned model using Polyglot-Ko (5.8B) as the baseline PLM and a dataset containing a wide range of zero-shot instructions and partially containing summarization instructions. We compared this reference model with another model fine-tuned using KakaoBank’s CS dialogues and summarization data as the instruct dataset. The results demonstrated that the fine-tuned model based on KakaoBank’s internal datasets outperformed the reference model, showing a 199\% and 12\% improvement in ROUGE-L and RDASS, respectively. This study emphasizes the significance of task-specific fine-tuning using appropriate instruct datasets for effective performance in specific downstream tasks. Considering its practical use, we suggest that fine-tuning using real-world instruct datasets is a powerful and cost-effective technique for developing generative AI in the business domain.},

  abstract = {This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. Following a successful workshop in 2022, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

The continuous enhancement in the quality of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC), including but not limited to images and text, is forging new paradigms for its application, particularly within the domain of Augmented Reality (AR). Nevertheless, the application of GenAI within the AR design process remains opaque. This paper aims to articulate a design space encapsulating a series of criteria and a prototypical process to aid practitioners in assessing the aptness of adopting pertinent technologies. The proposed model has been formulated based on a synthesis of design insights garnered from ten experts, obtained through focus group interviews. Leveraging these initial insights, we delineate potential applications of GenAI in AR.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of studies use gender information to un-derstand phenomena such as gender bias, inequity in access and participation, or the impact of the Covid pandemic response. Un-fortunately, most datasets do not include self-reported gender in-formation, which makes it necessary for researchers to infer gen-der from other information, such as from names or names and country information. In this paper, we compare the performance of the new generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT with three traditional commercially available list-based and ma-chine learning-based gender inference tools—Namsor, Gender-API, and genderize.io—on a unique dataset. Specifically, we use a large Olympic athlete dataset and report how variations in the input (e.g., first name and first \&amp; last name, with and without country information) impact the accuracy of their predictions. We find that Namsor is the best traditional commercially available tool. However, ChatGPT performs at least as well as Namsor and often outper-forms it, especially for the female sample when country and/or last name information is available. We conclude ChatGPT may be a cost-effective tool for gender prediction.},

Being trained on this unique dataset enables the AI to generate new and innovative sneaker designs that draw inspiration from the archive and pay homage to the rich history of the adidas brand. AI Archive has been rolled out to our designers as a web application in 2022. The tool has since established itself as an essential ingredient in the concept-to-prototype process of many of our designers. The proposed system gives users a high level of control over the design process, enabling them to precisely guide the AI to create designs according to their direction.

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence has made significant strides, producing text indistinguishable from human prose and remarkably photorealistic images. Automatically measuring how close the generated data distribution is to the target distribution is central to diagnosing existing models and developing better ones. We present MAUVE, a family of comparison measures between pairs of distributions such as those encountered in the generative modeling of text or images. These scores are statistical summaries of divergence frontiers capturing two types of errors in generative modeling. We explore three approaches to statistically estimate these scores: vector quantization, non-parametric estimation, and classifier-based estimation. We provide statistical bounds for the vector quantization approach.Empirically, we find that the proposed scores paired with a range of f-divergences and statistical estimation methods can quantify the gaps between the distributions of humanwritten text and those of modern neural language models by correlating with human judgments and identifying known properties of the generated texts. We demonstrate in the vision domain that MAUVE can identify known properties of generated images on par with or better than existing metrics. In conclusion, we present practical recommendations for using MAUVE effectively with language and image modalities.},

However, users often feel uncertain about whether generative art should be considered created by AI or by themselves. Losing the sense of ownership of the outcome might impact the learning process and confidence of novice designers and design learners who seek to benefit from using Generative Design Tools. In this context, we propose OwnDiffusion, a design pipeline that utilizes Generative AI to assist in the physical prototype ideation process for novice product designers and industrial design learners while preserving their sense of ownership. The pipeline incorporates a prompt weight assessing tool, allowing designers to fine-tune the AI’s input based on their sense of ownership. We envision this method as a solution for AI-assisted design, enabling designers to maintain confidence in their creativity and ownership of a design.},

Less than a decade ago, it was thought that creative work would be among the last to be automated&nbsp;– yet today, we see AI encroaching on many creative domains. In this paper, we present the findings of a survey study on people’s perceptions of text-to-image generation. We touch on participants’ technical understanding of the emerging technology, their fears and concerns, and thoughts about risks and dangers of text-to-image generation to the individual and society. We find that while participants were aware of the risks and dangers associated with the technology, only few participants considered the technology to be a personal risk. The risks for others were more easy to recognize for participants. Artists were particularly seen at risk. Interestingly, participants who had tried the technology rated its future importance lower than those who had not tried it. This result shows that many people are still oblivious of the potential personal risks of generative artificial intelligence and the impending societal changes associated with this technology.},

With generative artificial intelligence, conventional phishing detection advice such as looking out for linguistic errors and bad layouts will become obsolete. New approaches to improve people’s ability to detect phishing are essential. We report on promising results from two experiments (total N = 183) that engaging people with an adversarial mindset improves their ability to detect phishing e-mails compared to those who received conventional or no training. Participants who completed conventional training were nearly three times as likely to fall for a simulated phishing attack compared to those who completed the adversarial training, in which they watched a fictitious cybercriminal explain how to devise a targeted phishing e-mail, and then wrote targeted phishing e-mails themselves. Although further research is needed to examine the training’s long-term efficacy with larger sample sizes, the present findings show an encouraging alternative to conventional phishing training approaches.},

However, these generative AI applications lack clarity on how they work and operate for their users. Revealing how generative AI tools work enables designers to understand these tools’ limitations and capabilities. We developed a tangible interface with sand as a medium for human-AI co-creation, Sand Playground. It extends the work in human-AI drawing practices beyond two-dimensional digital surfaces. Sand playground has three co-drawing modes, artistic mimicry, zen garden and doodling. We conducted a user study with ten designers. One of our findings is that the interface enabled users to predict the AI agent’s actions. Our research introduces novel insights into the role of tangible interactions and physical interfaces in generative AI literacy and explainability in design tools.},

We will look at different stages in the development lifecycle of interactive systems and assess the value of AI support. We explore how GenAI and LLMs can potentially speed-up the ideation, requirements elicitation, architecture development, prototyping, implementation, and testing of interactive systems. The talk will outline emerging practices, such as the use of prompts for code and system generation, to facilitate prototyping and accelerate implementation. We will outline fundamental challenges and suggest emerging research directions, and pose research questions. What will software development tools look like in the future? How can we efficiently use AI to develop interactive systems without compromising quality? We also speculate about the implications of these developments for researchers, practitioners, and society. We believe that it will massively accelerate the digital transformation. Interactive AI-based tools for systems and software development will become a major research direction.},

  abstract = {Tasks are central to information retrieval (IR) and drive interactions with search systems [2, 4, 10]. Understanding and modeling tasks helps these systems better support user needs [8, 9, 11]. This keynote focuses on search tasks, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the implications of recent work at their intersection for the future of search. Recent estimates suggest that half of Web search queries go unanswered, many of them connected to complex search tasks that are ill-defined or multi-step and span several queries[6]. AI copilots, e.g., ChatGPT and Bing Chat, are emerging to address complex search tasks and many other challenges. These copilots are built on large foundation models such as GPT-4 and are being extended with skills and plugins. Copilots broaden the surface of tasks achievable via search, moving toward creation not just finding (e.g., interview preparation, email composition), and can make searchers more efficient and more successful.Users currently engage with AI copilots via natural language queries and dialog and the copilots generate answers with source attribution [7]. However, in delegating responsibility for answer generation, searchers also lose some control over aspects of the search process, such as directly manipulating queries and examining lists of search results [1]. The efficiency gains from auto-generating a single, synthesized answer may also reduce opportunities for user learning and serendipity. A wholesale move to copilots for all search tasks is neither practical nor necessary: model inference is expensive, conversational interfaces are unfamiliar to many users in a search context, and traditional search already excels for many types of task. Instead, experiences that unite search and chat are becoming more common, enabling users to adjust the modality and other aspects (e.g., answer tone) based on the task.The rise of AI copilots creates many opportunities for IR, including aligning generated answers with user intent, tasks, and applications via human feedback [3]; understanding copilot usage, including functional fixedness [5]; using context and data to tailor responses to people and situations (e.g., grounding, personalization); new search experiences (e.g., unifying search and chat); reliability and safety (e.g., accuracy, bias); understanding impacts on user learning and agency; and evaluation (e.g., model-based feedback, searcher simulations [12] repeatability). Research in these and related areas will enable search systems to more effectively utilize new copilot technologies together with traditional search to help searchers better tackle a wider variety of tasks.},

Our goal is to not only showcase the potential of GenAI for design, but to engage in discussions of its shortcomings and opportunities as they have been already articulated by scholars. By synthesizing both published and unpublished works, we will develop best practices, ethical considerations, and future research directions for the use of GenAI in design. We will explore a range of topics and themes, including leveraging the characteristics of GenAI for design, mapping the diverse applications of GenAI in design, envisioning a framework for design, and guiding future work on GenAI in design research. Ultimately, we hope to provide a roadmap for the integration of GenAI into the design research process and to encourage designers and researchers to explore the potential of GenAI in a thoughtful and deliberate way.},

Recognizing the significance of AI, educators are expected not only to teach about AI but also to utilize AI tools in their teaching, ensuring that their students are equipped with the necessary knowledge to navigate the AI-driven society. Thus, it is important to understand how educators perceive AI. In this study, we explore educators’ perceptions of AI, as well as whether they teach AI, the challenges they face in teaching AI, potential support for teaching AI in the future, and possible differences between Cypriot and international educators. Two online surveys, involving 197 educators, followed by interviews with 10 Cypriot educators were conducted to examine how they perceive AI. The findings revealed a shared conceptualization of AI as “human-like”, intelligent machines, capable of learning and solving problems using data. Notable differences in the definitions of AI emerged between Cypriot educators and their international counterparts. Furthermore, the findings showed that even though educators perceive teaching AI as important, they lack formal training and specialized educational tools on AI, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions and tailored resources.},

However, distinctions between children’s and adult’s creative needs exist, which is important when considering the possibility of GenAI for children’s creative usage. Building upon work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), fostering children’s computational thinking skills, this study explores interactions between children (aged 7-13) and GenAI tools through methods of participatory design. We seek to answer two questions: (1) How do children in co-design workshops perceive GenAI tools and their usage for creative works? and (2) How do children navigate the creative process while using GenAI tools? How might these interactions support their confidence in their ability to create? Our findings contribute a model that describes the potential contexts underpinning child-GenAI creative interactions and explores implications of this model for theories of creativity, design, and use of GenAI as a constructionist tool for creative self-efficacy.},

We present GenAI-enhanced data comic prototypes created using a combination of the generative artificial intelligence tool, Midjourney, and graphics illustration software.

To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study involving 16 professional designers from the automotive industry. We aimed to identify their challenges with existing GenAI image generation tools in daily design practices. Thematic analysis revealed four key themes: (1) the need for visual input-centric multi-modal interfaces that extend beyond textual prompts, (2) the lack of support for the iterative nature of design processes in GenAI tools, (3) difficulties in controlling prompts to achieve desired outputs, and (4) the significance of incorporating human experiences and emotions into design.

  abstract = {Due to changing demographics, limited availability of experts, and frequent job transitions, retaining and sharing knowledge within organizations is crucial. While many learning systems already address this issue, they typically lack automation and scalability in teaching novices and, thus, hinder the learning processes within organizations. Recent research emphasizes the capability of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to make black-box artificial intelligence systems interpretable for decision-makers. This work explores the potential of using (X)AI-based learning systems for providing learning examples and explanations to novices. In an exploratory study, we evaluate novices’ learning performance in a learning setting taking into account their cognitive abilities. Our results show that novices increase their learning performance throughout the exploratory study. These results shed light on how XAI can facilitate learning, taking first steps towards understanding the potential of XAI in learning systems.},

It also places fundamental importance on ethical considerations in determining legitimate and illegitimate uses of AI. Organizations that apply ethical AI have clearly stated well-defined review processes to ensure adherence to legal guidelines. Therefore, the wave of research at the intersection of ethical AI in data mining and machine learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and social science. Despite these successes, ethical AI still faces many challenges, such as a lack of interpretable and explainable methods for fairness-aware deep learning models, etc. Consequently, there is an urgent need to bring experts and researchers together at prestigious venues to discuss ethical AI, which has been rarely seen in previous KDD conferences. This workshop will provide a premium platform for both research and industry from different backgrounds to exchange ideas on opportunities, challenges, and cutting-edge techniques in ethical AI.},

We discuss how generative AI can support this transformation process and traditional variability engineering tasks, such as identification and implementation of features, synthesis of a template code generator, and development of end-user configurators.

  abstract = {As researchers today, we are witnessing a fundamental change in our technologically-enabled world due to the advent and diffusion of highly disruptive technologies such as generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). In particular, software engineering has been profoundly affected by the transformative power of disruptive innovations for decades, with a significant impact of technical advancements on social dynamics due to its socio-technical nature. In this article, we reflect on the importance of formulating and addressing research problems in software engineering through a socio-technical lens, thus ensuring a holistic understanding of the complex phenomena in this field. We propose a research playbook with the aim of providing a guide to formulate compelling and socially relevant research questions and to identify the appropriate research strategies for empirical investigations, with an eye on the long-term implications of technologies or their use. We showcase how to apply the research playbook. Firstly, we show how it can be used retrospectively to reflect on a prior disruptive technology, Stack Overflow, and its impact on software development. Secondly, we show how it can be used to question the impact of two current disruptive technologies: AI and AR/VR. Finally, we introduce a specialized GPT model to support the researcher in framing future investigations. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of adopting the playbook for both researchers and practitioners in software engineering and beyond.},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are susceptible to unsecure communication problems in denied environments because of strong interferences from physical fields and electromagnetic fields. A dynamic key management scheme based on Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) and the Hash function is proposed here to solve this problem. Specifically, as changes in the topological structure and unstable communication are likely to cause security problems in communication of drones in the battlefield, two dynamic key update protocols, i.e., topology-aware key update and mutual-healing key update, are put forth here to ensure secure communication through dynamically-updated keys. Analyses reveal that the proposed scheme has forward and backward security and resistance to collusion attacks and replay attacks. Meanwhile, the proposed method has been compared with existing methods through tests on the popular MIRACL dataset by Visual Studio 2019, and the test results show that our method optimizes the computing performance and the communication overhead, and achieves higher updating efficiency.},

  abstract = {As generative artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more common in day-to-day life, AI-generated content (AIGC) needs to be accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. These characteristics typically are determined by subjective, human-based image quality assessment; however, there is limited research on the qualification of AI-generated image quality. Over 9,800 images were generated using Craiyon and OpenAI's DALL-E 2 text-to-image models and evaluated on the three criteria proposed for determining the quality of visual AIGC: (1) the number of objects, (2), resolution (strictly image quality; label/prompt exclusive), and (3) representativeness (consideration for how well the image matches the label/prompt). We observe that the paid, DALL-E 2 model, produced a dataset with fewer objects per image, higher resolution, and higher representativeness compared to Craiyon (free). There is an inverse relationship between the number of objects/images and its resolution and representativeness. This study establishes three subjective metrics for the evaluation of synthetic images to support the creation of more inclusive AIGC.},

  abstract = {Conceptual design is an essential stage in the design process, and its ultimate success largely depends on designers’ creativity. Both physical and digital prototypes are commonly adopted by designers to support ideation and creativity, providing intuitive perception and rapid iteration, respectively. In recent advancements, large-scale generation models are able to offer data-enabled creativity support by generating high-quality solutions comparable to human designers. This opens up an imaginary space for designers and brings new possibilities for design tools. In this study, we proposed a hybrid prototype method that synergistically combines physical models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the conceptual design stage. Correspondingly, we developed a hybrid prototype system to implement the proposed method. We conducted a comparative user study with 45 designers who completed a design task using the physical prototype method, standalone generative AI and the hybrid prototype method, respectively. Our results verified the effectiveness of the hybrid prototype method and investigated its mechanism in supporting creativity. Finally, we discussed the application value and optimisation space of the hybrid prototype method.},

  abstract = {Classifying malware images is important in cybersecurity. The nature of different families and classes of malware images is imbalanced, which leads to a challenging issue of biased classification, where the majority classes dominate the model's performance. Attention is drawn to generative artificial intelligence, in which a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to synthesize more training samples (particularly in minority classes). A more balanced dataset can reduce biased classification towards the majority class. However, a robust GAN model usually requires high computing power and a lot of epochs. In this paper, we aim to design a lightweight GAN model to enhance the performance of malware image classification in imbalanced datasets. Performance evaluation and analysis show that it enhances the model's accuracy and reduces its training time. Future research directions are also shared.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of science and technology, system security is facing an increasing number of threats, among which system vulnerabilities have brought serious challenges to information security. In such an environment, system logs, as key data that record the operating status of computer systems, user operations and various events, play an extremely important role in monitoring system health and quickly locating and resolving system failures. However, the current accuracy of log parsing is not high enough to meet the actual demand; the parsing process is inefficient and difficult to adapt to the processing requirements of large data log files. Aiming at the problems of insufficient accuracy of log parsing and low efficiency of parsing process, a log parsing method AT-parser (Log parser based on word attributes and parse trees) is proposed. Through the log preprocessing, the log content used in the subsequent construction of log templates can be separated, the log content combined with word attribute filtering, retaining the key words, constructing a string set through the key words, and then performing similarity clustering based on the string set to classify the log strings into different log groups. Finally, the final template sequence is generated by constructing a parse tree, which improves the accuracy and speeds up the parsing efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness of AT-Parser is verified by experiments on public datasets.},

  abstract = {The goal of Few Shot Object Detection (FSOD) task is to effectively train and deploy object detection models even in small datasets, in order to achieve high-precision object detection results. Due to the few shot size of the dataset, the model may have difficulty learning sufficiently generalized feature representations, which can lead to overfitting or underfitting issues. Specifically, the model performs well during training, but shows a significant poor performance on test. That's because model overfits the noise and specific samples of the data in the training set, resulting in the inability to generalize to new data. Secondly, in the case of few shots, the target category scale in the dataset is single, making it difficult for the model to distinguish the same target at different scales, which affects detection accuracy. In order to effectively perform FSOD tasks, this paper proposes a meta learning FSOD algorithm based on PRN-FPN. Firstly, a data augmentation module is proposed to address the issue of data scarcity in few shot situations. The module includes three conversion strategies: color, color, and histogram equalization. Combining these three strategies can effectively increase the diversity of scarce data. In order to improve the algorithm's recognition and detection of targets of the same category but different scales, a Predictor head Removing Network with Feature Pyramid Network (PRN FPN) module is proposed. The module adds CARAFE Feature Pyramid Network on the basis of Predictor head Removal Network (RPN), and has the ability to detect few shot objects at multiple scales by fusing features at different depths. Finally, the algorithm was trained and tested on the publicly available dataset Pascal VOC, and the experimental results showed its effectiveness.},

The original data samples are transformed into grey scale graphs, and after combining the samples two by two, they are respectively subjected to feature extraction and comparison, which results in similarity scores, which are finally used to carry out classification. It is shown through experiments that the accuracy of detection can reach up to 98.45\% in the case of few-shot.},

The model demonstrates that the effect of redemptions on asset prices is linear, and the subsequent impact on fund performance is contingent on the initial shock level and asset liquidity diversity. Our findings suggest that funds those holding illiquid stocks face higher liquidity risks, and the liquidity level of underlying common assets between mutual fund portfolios dictates the extent of losses in the liquidated stock prices and the connected fund NAVs. Second, higher liquidity levels of common assets result in lower level of portfolio overlap. These findings highlight the urgency of establishing unified liquidity standard measurements and a cash buffer criterion. To manage fund stability and liquidity effectively, it is essential to implement measures such as minimum cash requirements and optimized asset allocation. These strategies have been proven to offer valuable insights for achieving financial success.},

The PAILQ-6 emerges in response to the need for an accessible instrument that evaluates general AI literacy without compromising on clarity or depth, suitable for both academic and practical applications. This paper presents the development process of the PAILQ-6, consisting of six items derived from established components of AI literacy, structured as a seven-point Likert scale for easy administration and digital compatibility. The validation study was conducted from data of a gender-balanced sample of 232 UK adults. The article demonstrates the PAILQ-6's reliability and validity through exploratory factor analysis, showing a two-factor structure. The findings reveal the scale's good internal consistency and convergent validity. The study highlights demographic predictors of AI literacy perceptions, indicating a possible gender disparity and the positive influence of higher education on perceived AI competency.},

  abstract = {As personalized recommendation techniques continue to evolve and be applied, recommendation systems face a plethora of malicious attacks. In order to defend against potential malicious attacks, enhance the robustness of recommendation systems, and strengthen their ability to withstand attacks, it is necessary to propose a method based on Variational Graph Auto-encoders (VGAE) for generating shilling attacks. This method improves the VGAE model, models user profiles, and generates reconstructed user profiles that conform to the original rating patterns. By utilizing spectral clustering, users are selected from the original dataset as templates in a dispersed manner according to a certain attack scale. These templates are then matched with the most similar fake users in the reconstructed user profiles. Within these fake user profiles, ratings for the most popular items in each category and target item ratings are inserted. Finally, fake user profiles are generated and injected into the recommendation system to broadly promote target items to users of the system. Experimental results on the MovieLens 100k and 1M datasets demonstrate that this new method exhibits more stable attack performance and stronger detection evasion capabilities compared to traditional attack strategies, thereby better exposing existing issues within recommendation systems.},

  abstract = {Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has gained significant attention, especially in AI-powered autonomous and adaptive systems (AASs). However, a discernible disconnect exists among research efforts across different communities. The machine learning community often overlooks “explaining to whom,” while the human-computer interaction community has examined various stakeholders with diverse explanation needs without addressing which XAI methods meet these requirements. Currently, no clear guidance exists on which XAI methods suit which specific stakeholders and their distinct needs. This hinders the achievement of the goal of XAI: providing human users with understandable interpretations. To bridge this gap, this article presents a comprehensive XAI roadmap. Based on an extensive literature review, the roadmap summarizes different stakeholders, their explanation needs at different stages of the AI system lifecycle, the questions they may pose, and existing XAI methods. Then, by utilizing stakeholders’ inquiries as a conduit, the roadmap connects their needs to prevailing XAI methods, providing a guideline to assist researchers and practitioners to determine more easily which XAI methodologies can meet the specific needs of stakeholders in AASs. Finally, the roadmap discusses the limitations of existing XAI methods and outlines directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Private Set Intersection Cardinality (PSI - CA) is a cryptographic primitive through which two or more participants can obtain the intersection cardinality of their private sets and the privacy of the sets is protected. In this paper, we propose a tripartite protocol that utilizes quantum resources to accomplish these tasks, in which each two or more parties can obtain the intersection cardinality of their private sets with the help of semi-honest third parties (TP). Using this property, a voting protocol is designed. In our protocol, the GHZ state is used to encode private information that TP will use to compute the cardinality. We prove that the proposed protocol is secure against well-known quantum attacks. Furthermore, compared with existing quantum voting schemes, the protocol achieves higher efficiency.},

This study focuses on the behavioral intentions of elementary and secondary school teachers to use generative artificial intelligence (AIGC) to assist their teaching and its influencing factors. Based on the Integration Technology Acceptance Model (UTAUT), we analyzed the influence of factors such as performance expectations, effort expectations, social influences, and enabling conditions on primary and secondary school teachers' use of AIGC. Through questionnaire survey and data analysis, it was found that these factors have a significant effect on teachers' use of AIGC and that there are significant differences in teachers' personal characteristics such as teaching experience, gender and IT proficiency in terms of behavioral intention. In order to enhance teachers' intention to use AIGC, it is recommended to strengthen teachers' skill training, improve the quality of AIGC products, and optimize the smart teaching environment and application planning in schools.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of 5G and mobile internet, various application fields continue to generate diverse dynamic streaming graphs with large scales and complex structures. Analyzing, querying and mining such a streaming graph face great challenges. To address the challenge of low query efficiency and avoid data loss, this paper proposes a two-stage coarsening method that preserves key features of a streaming graph while improves query efficiency. In the initial stage, the size of the streaming graph is not that large yet. To preserve its structure and attributes as much as possible, a linear mapping method is used for graph coarsening. As the size of the streaming graph increases, a graph neural network model based on cluster pooling is constructed in the second stage. Using a large number of graph coarsening results obtained in the initial stage to train and optimize this model. Then, we use this optimized model to obtain the subsequent summaries, which achieves online efficient graph coarsening. Finally, extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm significantly improves the quality of streaming graph coarsening compared to traditional algorithms. Even compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm Auxo, our algorithm shows a better performance on preserving key features.},

To address this, this paper introduces a novel approach to personalized music synthesis, incorporating a human-in-the-loop generation. This method leverages the dual strengths of interactive evolutionary computation, known for its capturing user preferences, and generative adversarial network, renowned for its capacity to autonomously produce high-quality music. The primary objective of this integration is to augment the credibility and diversity of generative AI in music synthesis, fostering computational artistic creativity in humans. Furthermore, a user-friendly interactive music player has been designed to facilitate users in the music synthesis process. The proposed method exemplifies a paradigm wherein users manipulate latent space through human-machine interaction, underscoring the pivotal role of humans in the synthesis of diverse and creative music.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence is widely used for various tasks such as language translation and art creation. Generative inference employs the key and value tensors to encode relational information among the tokens in the input and output sequences. Most of the existing generative inference frameworks use KV caching (KVC), which caches the key and value tensors (i.e., the KV cache) to avoid recomputing the key and value tensors for each of the processed tokens. Despite the widespread use of KVC, in-depth characterization of KVC with tensor offloading, which enables generative inference with a single GPU, remains yet to be explored. To bridge this gap, this work presents an in-depth characterization study of KVC, which demonstrates that KVC makes a sub-optimal trade-off between computations and communications in the context of generative inference with tensor offloading. Guided by the characterization results, we propose a novel caching technique called activation sequence caching (ASC) for high-throughput and memory-efficient generative inference with a single GPU. ASC is designed to significantly reduce the memory usage and communication overheads of generative inference at the cost of the increased computational complexity. We provide an analytical analysis of the three caching techniques (i.e., zero caching, KVC, and ASC) for generative inference in terms of the memory usage, communication overheads, and computational complexity. Our quantitative evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of ASC in that ASC significantly (e.g., 78.3\% higher throughput) outperforms a state-of-the-art generative inference framework (i.e., FlexGen) that implements KVC across various model sizes, input and output sequence lengths, and GPUs.},

Recent approaches generally resort to large-scale Visual-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to identify novel objects. However, incorporating these models into the OVD problem faces two main challenges: (1) the dgenerated performance when applying a VLM that pre-trained for whole image classification on regional object recognition; (2) the difficulty to localize objects from novel categories. To overcome the above challenges, we propose ACTOR, a DETR-style model which Adapting CLIP for fully Transformer-based Open-vocabulary detection via bidiRectional prompt learning and conditional decoding. Bidirectional prompt learning tightens the alignment between CLIP's regional object features and text embeddings. Conditional decoding facilitates learning a generalizable object localizer through a class-aware matching mechanism. Our experiments on the OV-COCO benchmark demonstrate that ACTOR achieves a competitive detection performance with the end-to-end open-vocabulary detector OV-DETR, while exhibiting a much faster inference speed.},

  abstract = {Since the launch of applications such as dall•e, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, generative artificial intelligence has been controversial as a tool for creating artwork. Some writers have presented worries about these technologies as harbingers of fully automated futures to come, but more pressing is the impact of generative AI on creative labour in the present. Already, business leaders have begun replacing human artistic labour with AI-generated images. In response, the artistic community has launched a protest movement, which argues that AI image generation is a kind of theft. This paper analyzes, substantiates, and critiques these arguments, concluding that AI image generators involve an unethical kind of labour theft. If correct, many other AI applications also rely upon theft.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are evaluated using competitive methods that rely on benchmark datasets to determine performance. These benchmark datasets, however, are often constructed through arbitrary processes that fall short in encapsulating the depth and breadth of the tasks they are intended to measure. In this paper, we interrogate the naturalization of benchmark datasets as veracious metrics by examining the historical development of benchmarking as an epistemic practice in AI research. Specifically, we highlight three key case studies that were crucial in establishing the existing reliance on benchmark datasets for evaluating the capabilities of AI systems: (1) the sharing of Highleyman’s OCR dataset in the 1960s, which solidified a community of knowledge production around a shared benchmark dataset, (2) the Common Task Framework (CTF) of the 1980s, a state-led project to standardize benchmark datasets as legitimate indicators of technical progress; and (3) the Netflix Prize which further solidified benchmarking as a competitive goal within the ML research community. This genealogy highlights how contemporary dynamics and limitations of benchmarking developed from a longer history of collaboration, standardization, and competition. We end with reflections on how this history informs our understanding of benchmarking in the current era of generative artificial intelligence.},

This workshop offers an opportunity for a strategic implementation of generative artificial intelligence in higher education, demonstrating its capacity to substantially enhance the creation and customization of digital educational materials. It is essential for educators to possess the capacity to utilize generative artificial intelligence tools, specifically when it comes to developing prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). In addition to fostering a more interactive learning environment, these LLMs are driving the transition to educational systems that are more autonomous and adaptable. An in-depth exploration of the pragmatic and ethical aspects of generative AI implementation is undertaken to equip educators with the necessary knowledge and skills to employ AI in a responsible manner, thereby cultivating an engaging and equitable learning environment. This workshop was prepared based on successful previous experiences in different conferences and meetings in Spain, Portugal, Germany, M\'{e}xico, Guatemala, Colombia, and USA.},

One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052\% were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.},

Through examination of existing ethical frameworks, legislation, principles, and guidelines, this paper aims to bridge the gap between high-level ethical guidelines and their practical application in AI development workflows. The framework emphasises transparency, accountability, and stakeholder involvement, and aligns with consequentialist, deontological, and virtue ethics perspectives. AI-GFA aims to empower development teams to proactively address ethical risks by facilitating informed decision-making and promoting a culture of ethical accountability, transparency, and stakeholder involvement to maximise overall utility by considering a wide range of perspectives and potential consequences.},

  abstract = {The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) has been the center of the most outstanding advancements in the last years. The ability to analyze considerable streams of data in real time makes these technologies the most promising tool in many domains, including cybersecurity. As an outstanding example, ML can be used for identifying malware because of its ability to detect patterns otherwise difficult to see for humans and hard-coded rules. However, the use of AI and ML in security-relevant domains raised rightful concerns about their trustworthiness and robustness, espe- cially in front of adaptive attackers. Additionally, privacy threats are now emerging as a crucial aspect and need proper testing and possibly mitigation to prevent data stealing and leakage of sensitive information. AISec provides a venue for presenting and discussing new developments in the intersection of security and privacy with AI and ML.

However, professionals often struggle to learn to work with GenAI systems effectively. While research has begun to explore the design of interfaces that support users in learning to co-create with GenAI, we lack systematic approaches to investigate the effectiveness of these supports. In this paper, we present a systematic approach for studying how to support learning to co-create with GenAI systems, informed by methods and concepts from the learning sciences. Through an experimental case study, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to study and compare the impacts of different types of learning supports in the context of text-to-image GenAI models. Reflecting on these results, we discuss directions for future work aimed at improving interfaces for human–AI co-creation.},

  abstract = {CG (Computer Graphics) is a popular field of CS (Computer Science), but many students find this topic difficult due to it requiring a large number of skills, such as mathematics, programming, geometric reasoning, and creativity. Over the past few years, researchers have investigated ways to harness the power of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) to improve teaching. In CS, much of the research has focused on introductory computing. A recent study evaluating the performance of an LLM (Large Language Model), GPT-4 (text-only), on CG questions, indicated poor performance and reliance on detailed descriptions of image content, which often required considerable insight from the user to return reasonable results. So far, no studies have investigated the abilities of LMMs (Large Multimodal Models), or multimodal LLMs, to solve CG questions and how these abilities can be used to improve teaching.In this study, we construct two datasets of CG questions requiring varying degrees of visual perception skills and geometric reasoning skills, and evaluate the current state-of-the-art LMM, GPT-4o, on the two datasets. We find that although GPT-4o exhibits great potential in solving questions with visual information independently, major limitations still exist to the accuracy and quality of the generated results. We propose several novel approaches for CG educators to incorporate GenAI into CG teaching despite these limitations. We hope that our guidelines further encourage learning and engagement in CG classrooms.},

  abstract = {As an important platform for corporate financing and investor trading, the stock market plays an important role in economic development and capital allocation. How to predict stock price effectively has become the object of many scholars' research. In recent years, with the swift advancement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), their performance in the field of stock price prediction has attracted wide attention. This study proposes an improved Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) stock price prediction model, with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) as a generator. Compared with traditional GANs, the choice of GRU ensures that improved WGAN-GP has excellent prediction accuracy while being stable in training, and the inclusion of Residual Neural Network in the discriminator significantly improves the predictive performance of the model. In addition, Bull/Bear Ratio (BR) is introduced into the model as an input feature, which can well reflect investor sentiment.},

  abstract = {The development of big data provides abundant resources for enterprises to target users and adjust development strategies. However, it also brings about an escalating risk of personal information leakage. In this context, the methods and standards for determining the acts of infringement have yet to be clarified, leading to different judgements in the same case. Grounded on the existing modes of legislation and judicial adjudication, the paper proposes machine learning methods to deconstruct the determination of acts of infringement, with a goal of assisting judges in making more accurate judgments. Specifically, the paper employs Adaboost regression model and the logistic regression model with gradient descent. Adaboost regression model combines multiple weak classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification, while the logistic regression model with gradient descent adjusts model values by minimizing the loss function to pursue the optimal ones. Through training and evaluation, the paper reveals that these models possess favorable applicability in determining the acts of infringement. Moreover, the paper also mentions the predictive results and evaluation metrics of the models, as well as their validation and application under various determination methods.Through the application of mathematical models and machine learning algorithms, the paper deconstructs the methods of infringement determination in personal information protection disputes. The evaluation and analysis of the models' applicability provides a guarantee for its adaption to different methods of determination, ensuring a reliable algorithmic model for the judicial review of personal information protection disputes when applying machine learning.},

  abstract = {The surge to popularity of Artificial Intelligence has greatly impacted on how the financial industry conducts their services. With several financial technology (FinTech) companies seizing the opportunity to be the first big fish in the market, a review on the impact of Artificial Intelligence in the FinTech industry around the world is necessary. While Artificial Intelligence provides significant benefits to FinTech companies, there are also risks and challenges that come with using AI. The availability of large datasets has paved the way for FinTech companies to utilize this opportunity to improve and transform their services. As the world moves on towards a cash-less future, people have been more inclined to use e-wallets and credit cards to perform their daily transactions. While this significantly improves the everyday financial experience of consumers, the lack of rigid authentication and verification usually leads to financial fraud that may eventually lead to billion-dollar loss from the consumer. Thus, this paper reviewed several articles on which different impacts of FinTech are discussed. Additionally, risks and challenges of usage of AI are also discussed. This paper shall serve as future reference for developing countries such as the Philippines in order to maximize their growth in the FinTech industry.},

Descriptive and lag sequential analysis methods were employed to examine the characteristics and patterns of students' information behavior according to Ellis' model of information seeking. The results indicated that although students frequently used generative AI tools as primary information sources, they also sought additional resources to satisfy their informational needs. Additionally, students sometimes copied and pasted useful information from generative AI tools into group documents to share with their group members. Lag sequential analysis revealed that students typically began their information seeking process with generative AI tools, followed by exploring additional information sources.},

Algorithms that do not depend on paired data have significant practical significance. In order to achieve the style transfer between Chinese ink paintings and Van Gogh's artworks, this paper introduces a self-made new dataset and implements the transformation between these two artistic styles based on the CycleGAN network model. Furthermore, through methods such as data augmentation and learning rate adjustment, this study extensively explores the key factors affecting the learning process of the adversarial loss function in CycleGAN. The results reveal that augmenting the self-made dataset through data enhancement techniques, such as adding noise and color transformations, can enhance the robustness of the model. Additionally, employing the "learning rate warm-up" strategy effectively updates parameters during training, leading to better fitting to the optimal solution.},

When reliant on deep learning, these systems need to address the reliability, robustness, and interpretability of learning models. In addition to developing strategies to address these concerns, appropriate software architectures are needed to coordinate LECs and ensure they deliver acceptable behavior even under uncertain conditions. This work describes Anunnaki, a model-driven framework comprising loosely-coupled modular services designed to monitor and manage LECs with respect to Trusted AI assurance concerns when faced with different sources of uncertainty. More specifically, the Anunnaki framework supports the composition of independent, modular services to assess and improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems. The design of Annunaki was guided by several key software engineering principles (e.g., modularity, composability, and reusability) in order to facilitate its use and maintenance to support different aggregate monitoring and assurance analysis tools for LESs and their respective data sets. We demonstrate Anunnaki on two autonomous platforms, a terrestrial rover, and an unmanned aerial vehicle. Our studies show how Anunnaki can be used to manage the operations of different autonomous learning-enabled systems with vision-based LECs while exposed to uncertain environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {In post-disaster scenarios, government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) work to coordinate disaster relief efforts efficiently, aiming to meet humanitarian needs promptly. Utilizing available data such as satellite imagery, sensor data, and social media, alongside data mining and big data analytics, can significantly enhance disaster management efforts. However, timely access to these often fragmented and incomplete data presents challenges. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, offer solutions by enabling faster response times for government agencies, NGOs, and other authorities. This research examines 72 studies on the application of AI in various stages of disaster management, including the simulation, detection, prediction, and handling of post-disaster situations. AI-based systems improve the issuance of early warnings, streamline risk communication, optimize relief logistics, and support evacuation plans while also aiding in the decision-making processes for the issuance of building permits and grants. The analysis highlights the transformative potential of AI across all disaster management phases, from preparedness and response to prevention/mitigation and recovery, and identifies future challenges in this domain. In conclusion, the study underscores the power of AI not only in forecasting the occurrence and impact zones of disasters but also in identifying the most vulnerable communities and assessing the viability of disaster response strategies.},

  abstract = {While Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has made significant strides in various sectors, there’s a discernible gap in literature regarding its specific applications and implications within the Financial Technology (FinTech) landscape. This paper endeavors to address this void, evaluating the potential of FinTech to harness GenAI’s capabilities and the existing discussions on GenAI’s impact in the domain. Through a comprehensive analysis of its integration by leading financial institutions such as Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and Capital One, the study offers insights into GenAI’s transformative potential in FinTech. We discuss the main problems these companies are solving, from identification and mitigation of fraudulent activities and ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks to improving customer service and operations and making better data-driven decisions. By addressing both the opportunities and challenges, this paper aims to provide a holistic perspective on the role of GenAI in the evolving FinTech sector.},

  abstract = {Machine game is divided into complete information game and incomplete information game. Similarly, according to the transparency of opponent information, military chess game can be divided into complete information chess game and incomplete information chess game. In this paper, we mainly study the complete information chess game. Aiming at the high time complexity and high computing power of traditional tree search algorithms, a Deep Monte-Carlo (DMC) algorithm based on segmentation strategy of reward is proposed to solve the problem of high mortality of high-level chess pieces and improve the winning rate of the whole game system. By competing with military chess systems constructed by Upper Confidence Tree (UCT) algorithm and Deep Q-learning (DQN) algorithm, we constructed a complete verification scheme to obtain the best segmentation strategy of reward and verify the effectiveness of DMC algorithm based on segmentation strategy of reward.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a subdiscipline of computer science, broadly speaking, usually refers to some computer program that can collect valid information from large amounts of data and perform some specific tasks of the developer. The goal is to develop new types of devices or programs that can recognize, analyze, and diagnose as humans do. The initial application of artificial intelligence (AI) was in the field of medical imaging for the automatic detection of lung nodules in X-ray and computed tomography (CT) techniques. Malignant pulmonary nodules are often associated with primary lung tumors and metastatic lung lesions, so the screening, diagnosis and differentiation of pulmonary nodules are very important for the subsequent treatment of lung diseases.},

It is born to solve the problems faced by the previous generation of the Internet such as imbalanced distribution of interests, monopoly of platform resources, and leakage of personal privacy. In this survey, we discuss the latest development status of Web 3.0 and the application of emerging AI technologies in it. First, we investigate the current successful practices of Web 3.0 and various components in the current Web 3.0 ecosystem and thus propose the hierarchical architecture of the Web 3.0 ecosystem from the perspective of application scenarios. The architecture we proposed contains four layers: data management, value circulation, ecological governance, and application scenarios. We dive into the current state of development and the main challenges and issues present in each layer. In this context, we find that AI technology will have great potential. We first briefly introduce the role that artificial intelligence technology may play in the development of Web 3.0. Then, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the current application status of artificial intelligence technology in the four layers of Web 3.0 and provide some insights into its potential future development directions.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the ethical implications of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings, from primary schools to universities, while drawing insights from ancient Greek philosophy to address emerging concerns. As AI technologies increasingly influence learning environments, they offer novel opportunities for personalized learning, efficient assessment, and data-driven decision-making. However, these advancements also raise critical ethical questions regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, student autonomy, and the changing roles of educators. This research examines specific use cases of AI in education, analyzing both their potential benefits and drawbacks. By revisiting the philosophical principles of ancient Greek thinkers such as Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato, we discuss how their writings can guide the ethical implementation of AI in modern education. The paper argues that while AI presents significant challenges, a balanced approach informed by classical philosophical thought can lead to an ethically sound transformation of education. It emphasizes the evolving role of teachers as facilitators and the importance of fostering student initiative in AI-rich environments.},

This research specifically delves into the promising possibilities and applications of AI in healthcare and medical domains, focusing on developing a Medical Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. The proposed approach involves using different pre-trained NER models and an in-house-generated corpora to train a personalized Spacy model. The research then conducts a thorough comparison of these models to understand their strengths and shortcomings. Widening the scope of the proposed research, we introduce an inventive mechanism to extract medical information from doctors' audio in real-time saved on buffer memory, deleted after use, which is then used to create patient medical prescriptions. The potential benefits of this mechanism are vast, expanding beyond reducing patient wait times, enhancing the clarity of prescriptions, maintains comprehensive patient histories, and finally introducing automation into the prescription drug ordering chain. Additionally, the proposed model eases the scheduling and management of medical tests and procedures based on doctor and patient availability. In jist, the proposed paper aims to present an innovative human-centric approach to automating interactions between patients and doctors and optimizing the delivery of healthcare services. Through the integration of modern-day AI services, The proposed mechanism has the potential to bring about a potential change in medical practices, providing a more efficient and effective breakthrough to patient care.},

  abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot, is transforming educational methodologies, including undergraduate physics courses for engineering students. Despite their potential, these LLMs typically rely on statistical learning methods and often exhibit algebraic inaccuracies in solving standard university-level physics problems. This study explores the use of LLMs in physics courses for N = 91 freshman engineering students over two academic terms (Spring and Fall 2023). Students engaged in AI-assisted activities to solve physics problems and were asked to identify and correct the errors made by the chatbot. The outcomes were compared with those from traditional teaching methods without AI involvement, and no significant difference in student learning gains was found. To assess the impact of AI tools in education, a more detailed approach using pre-test and post-test instruments&nbsp;with control and experimental groups is necessary. Survey results revealed, however, that AI-assisted sessions enhanced student engagement, problem-solving skills, and understanding of physics concepts. Students also indicated a strong preference for AI-assisted activities, citing increased motivation and a firm belief in the educational benefits of using these tools. Our findings suggest that well-designed AI interventions can effectively complement traditional instructional methods, especially when the LLMs are integrated with symbolic computational tools like WolframAlpha to improve their accuracy.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a new framework for studying the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the organization of knowledge work. We incorporate AI into an economy where humans endogenously form hierarchical firms: Less knowledgeable agents become "workers" solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable agents become "solvers" handling exceptions. We model AI as an algorithm that uses compute to mimic humans. We compare the equilibrium before and after AI's introduction, distinguishing between "basic" AI (with knowledge equivalent to pre-AI workers) and "advanced" AI (with knowledge equivalent to pre-AI solvers). We show that basic AI increases the knowledge content of human work, leading to smaller, less productive, and less decentralized firms. In contrast, advanced AI decreases the knowledge content of human work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized firms. In any case, the most knowledgeable humans benefit from AI, while the least knowledgeable benefit only when AI is sufficiently advanced. We discuss how these effects depend on AI's autonomy and the availability of compute. https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05481},

  abstract = {The appearance of inflammatory language on social media by college or university students is quite prevalent, inspiring platforms to engage in community safety mechanisms. Escalating hate speech entails creating sophisticated artificial intelligence-based, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to detect offensive internet content. With a few noteworthy exceptions, the majority of the studies on automatic hate speech recognition have emphasized high-resource languages, mainly English. We bridge this gap by addressing hate speech detection in Punjabi (Gurmukhi), a low-resource Indo-Aryan language articulated in Indian educational institutions. This research identifies cross-lingual hate speech in the code-switched English-Punjabi language used on social media. It proposes an approach combining the best hate speech detection techniques to cover existing state-of-the-art system gaps and limitations. In this method, the Roman Punjabi is transliterated, and then Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) based models are employed for hate detection. The proposed model has achieved 0.86 precision and 0.83 recall, and various higher educational institutions could employ it to discover the issues/domains where hate prevails the most.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have the potential to accelerate economic growth and promote sustainable development in developing countries. Particularly in Africa, the technology is expected to solve societal challenges, leapfrog, and promote sustainable communities. The literature presents examples of AI use cases in Africa to exemplify the opportunities, benefits, challenges, and risks of AI. Also, available reports highlight similar narratives with recommendations to improve the status quo. While such recommendations are essential, assessing what actions have already been implemented toward AI adoption is equally important. Still, more research is needed to showcase a holistic view of efforts taken by African countries to prepare for planning and implementing AI responsibly. This paper bridges the gap by examining the readiness of AI adoption in African countries from the literature using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. Findings reveal the need for further initiatives to realize the positive outcomes of AI technologies. The paper concludes by proposing the research areas that require further exploration from the context of African countries.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has brought many conveniences to people, and at the same time has had a huge impact on the traditional education model. Interactive learning platforms have become mainstream in the context of the big data era. This article takes an online course in a university as an example to explore user interest points, demand characteristics and knowledge acquisition rules in an artificial intelligence system environment. After processing and analyzing students' browsing behavior in different scenarios, the corresponding results are returned to the database to better grasp the user's preference information and provide more services for teaching. At the same time, through the application of machine intelligence algorithms and AI technology, the personalized recommendation capabilities of the learning platform can be improved to meet students' personalized learning needs. This article tests the algorithm of the system. The test results show that the content-based recommendation algorithm performs medium to high in accuracy, but its coverage is low and is not affected by data sparsity. The collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm performs generally highest in terms of accuracy and coverage, with an accuracy rate of 96\%, and is sensitive to sparse data. The hybrid recommendation algorithm has high accuracy and coverage, and factors such as data sparsity have a medium to high impact on it. Recommendation algorithms based on deep learning show high levels of accuracy and coverage, and their impact on factors such as data sparsity is also moderate to high. However, although artificial intelligence technology has broad prospects for application in the field of education, it also faces some challenges, such as privacy protection and compliance with data use. Therefore, in the process of promoting and applying artificial intelligence technology, it is necessary to strengthen compliance with relevant laws and regulations to ensure that students' information security and privacy rights are effectively protected.},

  abstract = {Design by Contract represents an established, lightweight paradigm for engineering reliable and robust software systems by specifying verifiable expectations and obligations between software components. Due to its laborious nature, developers hardly adopt Design by Contract in practice.    A plethora of research on (semi-)-automated inference to reduce the manual burden has not improved the adoption of so-called code contracts in practice.    This paper examines the potential of Generative AI to automatically generate code contracts in terms of pre- and postconditions for any Java project without requiring any additional auxiliary artifact.    To fine-tune two state-of-the-art Large Language Models, CodeT5 and CodeT5+, we derive a dataset of more than 14k Java methods comprising contracts in form of Java Modeling Language (JML) annotations, and train the models on the task of generating contracts.    We examine the syntactic and semantic validity of the contracts generated for software projects not used in the fine-tuning and find that more than 95\% of the generated contracts are syntactically correct and exhibit remarkably high completeness and semantic correctness.    To this end, our fully automated method sets the stage for future research and eventual broader adoption of Design by Contract in software development practice.},

  abstract = {Mathematical stories have demonstrated the ability to bolster the motivation and interest of students in learning mathematics, thereby exerting a positive influence on their academic performance. However, due to a lack of adequate resources and the desire to engage students in the creation process, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is utilized to generate mathematical stories accompanied by images. This study presents a framework for automatic quality assessment to evaluate the coherence of multimodal text and images generated by GAI, as well as the appropriateness of the stories for different grade levels. The dataset comprises mathematical stories generated by GAI for grades 3, 4, and 5, obtained from an American online learning platform, each story consisting of titles, bodies, and image illustrations generated by GP4, images generated by DALL-E3. Initially, a method is devised based on CLIP model and Mini-GPT4 for extracting multimodal semantic features to establish the relationship between text and images in mathematical stories and their generation parameters. Subsequently, mathematical text features are designed, including nine mathematical text attributes and ten traditional text readability indicators, followed by collinearity feature selection and statistical testing. Finally, five machine learning grade regressor for mathematical stories were trained, and the correlation between these 19 features and grades is explored using genetic algorithm-based factor mining and the interpretable artificial intelligence method SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To further understand advanced text features, the latest natural language processing (NLP) readability indicators are also integrated into the analysis. Through multimodal features, traditional text readability metrics, and NLP readability indicators, this method introduces a novel approach for automatically assessing the quality of GAI-generated multimodal mathematical stories, providing a tool for grade predictor and shedding light on the factors (Image-text relevance and textual features) influencing the grade level of analyzed stories, thereby offering new insights for leveraging GAI in mathematical education.},

  abstract = {Task-oriented chatbots are increasingly used to access all sorts of services – like booking a flight, or setting a medical appointment – through natural language conversation. There are many technologies for implementing task-oriented chatbots, including Dialogflow, Watson, and Rasa. They rely on an explicit definition of the user intents, conversation flows, and chatbot outputs, which is costly to specify, and sometimes results in suboptimal user experiences and artificial conversations with limited diversity of chatbot responses. Recently, the advances in generative artificial intelligence fostered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new range of open-domain chatbots, like ChatGPT, able to converse fluently on any topic. However, they are general-purpose, and therefore not directly usable to solve specialised tasks reliably. In this paper, we study the power of LLMs to build task-oriented chatbots, resulting in lighter specifications – no intent definition required – and more natural conversations than in intent-based approaches. To this end, we propose a lightweight domain-specific language based on YAML to specify chatbots using modules of different types (e.g., menus, question-answering, data gathering). These specifications are compiled into structured LLM prompts that use the ReAct framework to inform our runtime how to interpret the user input and coordinate the tasks that the chatbot must perform. The paper presents the design and realisation of our framework, and an assessment that encodes a set of existing intent-based chatbots using our approach, showing its benefits in terms of specification size, conversation flexibility and output diversity.},

Therefore, if the prenatal examination data is not accurately recorded and properly preserved, it will become a source of pressure for medical staff to face disputes in the future. This research takes the prenatal examinations of pregnant as a use case. We apply robotic process automation technology to assist in the automation of prenatal examinations and blockchain technology to establish trustworthy prenatal examinations. Besides, we also use generative artificial intelligence technology to provide intelligent user-assisted consultation in open-domain question answering.

In the current medical field, it is widely used in image recognition to diagnose patient symptoms, train clinical prediction models, and improve clinical workflow processes to avoid missing treatment opportunities. These methods have all achieved good results so far. Now, generative AI is also impacting the development of the medical field, not only generating prescriptions that match patient conditions but also being applied in generating medical images for data augmentation and simulating various pathological conditions, thereby aiding in training deep learning models. Stroke is a leading cause of death or disability, ranking as the second leading cause of death worldwide, next to cancer. If cancers were categorized individually, stroke would surpass all single diseases, making it a primary focus of research in brain disease treatment. There are already studies where generative AI has been used to create medical images, which are then manually evaluated by doctors to determine if they were generated by AI. In this project, we plan to generate CT images of strokes using generative AI and use a trained model (to diagnose stroke) to improve accuracy. Through this project, we hope to solve the problem of scarce stroke CT images while also providing support for training stroke-related models.},

However, the time non-stationary properties of MI-EEG signals and the uneven information distribution of different electrode channels pose challenges to the classification of MI-EEG. To address these challenges, we proposed a convolutional network based on channel and temporal attention (CTACNet). First, raw MI-EEG signals underwent noise reduction by common average reference. Subsequently, channel attention module was used to enhance the electrode channel information related to classification. Then, shallow spatiotemporal features of MI-EEG were extracted through convolutional neural network, and time series representations containing spatial information were output. Importantly, time attention module automatically adjusted and learned the impact of different time series on classification. Finally, deep spatiotemporal features were further extracted through time convolutional network, and fully connected layers were used to complete the classification of MI-EEG. Validation experiments based on the BCI competition IV-2a dataset showed that the proposed CTACNet achieved an average classification accuracy of 84.22\% for each subject. Compared with MBEEGSE, ETCNet, EEG-TCNet, and CNN-LSTM, there were significant improvements of 2.20\%, 9.42\%, 4.50\%, and 5.40\%, respectively. This demonstrates the potential of CTACNet in significantly enhancing MI-EEG decoding and intent recognition.},

Non-traditional sector players in GenAI have recently enabled a foothold in both industry and education to rapidly expand. With a focus on healthcare, agriculture, education, and finance, we highlight case studies that demonstrate the innovative applications of GenAI, illustrating its capability to drive significant industry transformations. Through this exploration, the paper emphasizes the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in catalyzing technological progress and broadening the impact of GenAI. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the current and potential future states of GenAI applications, this research aims to deepen understanding of its broader societal and economic implications. This study not only captures GenAI's transformative potential but also addresses the dual narrative of GenAI as both a promising tool, particularly for education, and a formidable challenge, underscoring its growing influence in non-traditional sectors.},

  abstract = {This research delves into integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI within Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to bolster fraud prevention measures. The study commences by thoroughly mapping the fraud tree taxonomy with existing ERP applications to identify areas susceptible to fraudulent activities, encompassing corruption, asset misappropriation, and financial statement fraud. The research proposes the utilisation of specific NLP and Generative AI APIs tailored to address these areas, effectively building upon these identified vulnerabilities. By establishing standardised criteria for API development, the research provides a comprehensive roadmap for the accounting and finance profession to adopt and implement these advanced technologies to combat fraud more efficiently. The suggested roadmap encompasses crucial stages, including evaluating organisational requirements, assessing API providers, seamlessly integrating APIs into ERP systems, conducting thorough testing, and establishing robust monitoring and governance mechanisms. The findings underscore the tremendous potential of NLP and Generative AI in fortifying fraud prevention endeavours within ERP systems while highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of this research, which amalgamates insights from ERP systems, fraud detection, NLP, and Generative AI. The study also encourages future empirical investigations to validate and refine the proposed solutions within real-world contexts.},

  abstract = {The continual advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence have created substantial hurdles for accurate deepfake detection, leading to limitations of currently popular detection methods across content-driven video-level deepfake detection scenarios. In this paper, we present the solutions to the Video-Level Deepfake Detection task. Our empirical findings demonstrate that modeling correlations of audio-visual modalities is important for video-level deepfake detection. Therefore, we introduce the model denoted Audio-Visual Local-Global Neural Network (i.e., AV-LGNN) in which the core design is the proposed AV-LGI Module (Audio-Visual Local-Global Interaction Module). The AV-LGI Module is composed of three stages: Local Intra-Region Interaction, Global Inter-Region Interaction, and Local-Global Interaction, which can better capture detailed information at local-level and efficiently learn the fine-grained correlations of inter-modalities in video deepfake detection under lower computational overheads. We further propose an adaptive modality selection strategy to facilitate model learning. Besides, a variety of data augmentation techniques are incorporated for audio-visual branches to enhance the robustness of the AV-LGNN. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of our model.},

Such chat interfaces are based on large language models (LLMs) and possess a vast array of abilities spanning conversation, the writing and debugging of code, the writing of papers, and the creation of images, music, and songs. With students now having access to a myriad of GAI tools, academia has been permanently altered.Our proposed system, named Code Analysis and Education Tutor (CAET), integrates GAI into early Computer Science education by providing students with an ethical alternative to existing GAI tools. CAET is designed to assist students with programming tasks in a manner tailored to their individual needs without jeopardizing the integrity of their learning. A point of uniqueness from existing works is CAET's ability to display or hide generated code based on its pertinence to the problem at hand. After subjecting multiple GAI models to common programming errors and queries, we settled on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model due to its comprehensive capabilities and cost-effectiveness. Overall, CAET underscored the model's conversational dynamics and provided insights for creating a more personalized learning experience for students in an introductory computer science course.},

However, assisting in creative tasks without getting in the way of the artist’s workflow can be challenging. Since there is no "correct" answer in creative works for the machine to steer towards, the machine must gauge the "goodness" or "badness" of its actions by watching the user’s response. We present our system, ‘Hero’, for eliciting and developing interactions around creative machines, particularly drawing machines. It uses multi-modal information about the user to steer when it should intervene in the creative process. We are using this system in user studies and interviews with artists to understand what modalities they would use to interact with and give feedback to a machine without disrupting their usual sense of creative workflow. This paper outlines this project’s background, Hero’s current system design, ongoing user experiments, and our planned future work to develop a mixed-initiative, multi-modal collaborative machine for creative tasks. This is a step towards bringing generative artificial intelligence into the messy complexity of physically embodied creative practice.},

However, traditional approaches could be underperforming as they often use data-driven strategies and assume that people only need additional information about their consumption to change behavior. A proposed path to overcome this issue is to design eco-feedback to foster emotional connections with users. However, not much is known about the effectiveness of such designs. In this paper, we propose a novel care-based eco-feedback system. Central to the system is a Tamagotchi-inspired digital character named Infi who gets its life force from the user’s energy savings. Additionally, we harness the latest advancements in generative artificial intelligence to enhance emotional attachment through conversational interactions that users can have with Infi. The results of a randomized controlled experiment (N=420) convey the fact that this design increases emotional attachment, which in turn increases energy-saving behavior.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development and the various applications of artificial intelligence technology has been gradually replacing many labor-intensive and creative tasks. Traditional design education in schools invests considerable time in cultivating students' basic skills in using techniques, tools, materials, etc., but overlooks the wave which has been brought by artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence has surpassed human performance in specific fields and is poised to replace the work of many laborers. As artificial intelligence technology advances, its applications will permeate more areas, including thinking and creative abilities that humans have taken pride in. Design education in universities should re-examine the design values of human designers and artificial intelligence respectively. This redefinition of values implies that the abilities required of designers need to be reframed. Design education in universities should also explore how to integrate artificial intelligence-related technologies into current design curricula. New design courses must manifest the value of human designers. Furthermore, design programs offered by universities should begin planning training courses on collaborative design with artificial intelligence and establish relevant mechanisms for making artificial intelligence an effective tool to assist designers. In addition to redefining the value of designers and planning artificial intelligence-assisted design courses, design departments should monitor industry trends and gather year-by-year feedback to provide students with up-to-date career development advice. We should recognize the crisis that artificial intelligence presents to current design education and address the impact of this wave on design students. Artificial intelligence is progressing toward an irreversible trend, and the growth and transformation of designers will become a new challenge for future design education.},

  abstract = {In this study, a visualized analysis of the target literature is made from different perspectives using CiteSpace and the literature analysis module of the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify the challenges that the generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technology poses to higher education and management and corresponding countermeasures. Our analysis revealed that GAI would reduce the demand for teachers, weaken the teacher-student tie, and exacerbate the students’ digital overdependence, causing conflicts in data ethics and intellectual property. Thus, recommendations are made here for the four parties involved in the research: the government should formulate laws to strengthen network supervision; schools need to advance the digital reform on talent training models; teachers need to keep up with the latest educational theories to shift their roles; and students need to remain critical and independent thinkers in the age of educational digitalization 2.0.},

  abstract = {Since its launch just over two years ago, the conversational chatbot ChatGPT developed by OpenAI has become integrated into the studies of students within the Swedish educational system. This paper investigates both teachers’ perspectives and attitudes toward students using ChatGPT and the students’ view of their perceived learning. Insights were gathered through questionnaires (for both students and teachers) and a learning session for students, revealing concerns and enthusiasm regarding ChatGPT’s integration. Teachers express a lack of understanding on incorporating ChatGPT into education and perceive a lack of support from school leadership and the Swedish National Agency for Education. Identified scenarios suggest ChatGPT’s potential for understanding concepts, but resistance toward its use in examinations. The students have a statistically significant enhancement in confidence and understanding of magnetism concepts after engaging with ChatGPT. This research contributes to ongoing discussions about integrating AI tools in education, emphasizing benefits and addressing ethical concerns and learning outcomes.},

  abstract = {Through the mechanism of propagating and aggregating information, graph neural networks have achieved impressive results in link prediction tasks. However, the higher-order patterns (higher-order links) prediction task is still challenging. The conventional idea directly expands existing methods used in pairwise relationship prediction. Information propagation is limited to local neighborhoods and the evaluation basis uses only the similarity between pairs of nodes. These methods fail to consider the underlying driving factors of higher-order formation processes. Therefore, a key strategy is introducing a driving factor that helps information propagation beyond the local scope and provides a global comparable criterion between multiple nodes. Cluster structure is one crucial driving factor observed in networks, where nodes within the same cluster exhibit similar behaviors and tend to form higher-order patterns. To this end, we use Clustering Information as a Driving factor for graph structure adjustments in Graph Convolutional Network (CIDGCN). CIDGCN uses clustering information to facilitate the prediction of higher-order patterns. It also extends the propagation of node information to the cluster level for Graph Convolutional Network to perform message-passing. Finally, we obtain more reliable features for higher-order patterns. CIDGCN is experimentally compared to four higher-order benchmarks, revealing its superiority in accurately predicting higher-order patterns.},

  abstract = {Before the advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, for example, ChatGPT, students traditionally approached assignment development authentically by employing libraries and by referring to textbooks. However, with the widespread reliance on powerful AI tools for assignment completion, the process has become more convenient. Unfortunately, this ease of use has led to a potential detriment in students' genuine understanding of subjects, as well as a decline in their problem-solving and innovative thinking skills. Moreover, AI tools like ChatGPT will evolve as technology advances such that the need to detect AI-generated content is even more crucial in educational setting to reinforce the value of original work [5]. This paper aims to address this issue by focusing on the detection of plagiarism in student assignments through the utilization of the Copyleaks1 tool, specifically designed to identify AI-generated code. The accuracy of the tool is systematically evaluated by submitting various pairs of codes, each with similar functionality, wherein one is generated by AI and the other by humans.},

  abstract = {The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced a monumental shift with the emerging of Generative AI (GenAI), which has demonstrated to be a transformative tool across diverse sectors. GenAI outputs can span various digital formats, including text, images, videos, and audio, generating particular interest in the public sector. The growing interest of governments in integrating GenAI technologies in public sector operations is marked by the creation of emerging governance instruments and the formulation of soft laws, like standards, principles, and guidelines. This study aims to delve into the intricacies and potential risks associated with the deployment of GenAI within government. Through a qualitative content analysis, the research meticulously examines GenAI usage guidelines issued by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and South Korea. The objective is to discern the risks acknowledged by these countries' soft laws and compare them with the risks identified by scholars in the field. The performed comparative analysis across countries suggest that the use of GenAI in the public sector raises common risks such as information leakage, data privacy, security, and concerns over public trust. By elucidating the varied risk perceptions across different national contexts, this study provides theoretical and practical implications related to the risks of GenAI within the public sector. Moreover, it sets a foundation for future research and policy development, ensuring that generative AI is used as a force for good in public governance.},

Specifically, we study: (1) What is the perceived veracity of human-generated fake news vs. AI-generated fake news? (2) What is the user's willingness to share human-generated fake news vs. AI-generated fake news on social media? (3) What socio-economic characteristics let users fall for AI-generated fake news? To this end, we conducted a pre-registered, online experiment with N= 988 subjects and 20 fake news from the COVID-19 pandemic generated by GPT-4 vs. humans. Our findings show that AI-generated fake news is perceived as less accurate than human-generated fake news, but both tend to be shared equally. Further, several socio-economic factors explain who falls for AI-generated fake news.},

The project integrates psychological interventions tailored for driving, drawing on automated driving advancements to ensure safety and effectiveness. Using a context-aware sensing framework, interactions are timed during appropriate driving scenarios to minimize distraction. The system obtains context data from car sensors and employs generative AI to deliver subtle interactions, enhancing user engagement and idea output without compromising safety. Evaluation includes measuring user engagement and post-drive self-reports to quantify the impact on idea generation and driving performance. This innovation integrates creativity support tools into daily commutes, potentially transforming in-car intelligence systems and enhancing productivity and innovation capabilities.},

Together, we co-designed an interactive workshops series aimed to onboard local entrepreneurs to generative AI platforms. Alongside four community-driven and iterative workshops with entrepreneurs across five months, we conducted interviews with 15 local entrepreneurs and community providers. We detail the importance of communal and supportive exposure to generative AI tools for local entrepreneurs, scaffolding actionable use (and supporting non-use), demystifying generative AI technologies by emphasizing entrepreneurial power, while simultaneously deconstructing the veneer of simplicity to address the many operational skills needed for successful application.},

The experimental results show that injecting a total of 4 faults in the 32nd round can fully recover the 80bit seed key, which is the best attack result so far against the differential fault attack of the TWINE algorithm.},

This paper proposes a comprehensive technology of defect classification method for pressure gas cylinders based on on-site collection of gas cylinder defect data set. The main work is as follows: 1) Aiming at the problem of insufficient number and unbalanced distribution of field-collected defect samples, a DA-DCGAN based on the dual-channel attention mechanism is designed to increase the sample data, and a self-attention generator and a dual-channel discriminator are constructed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the generated samples; 2) Based on the augmented and broadened dataset, a design of a cascaded HRNet classification network is proposed to increase the quality of pressure gas cylinders by means of global feature extraction, and local feature extraction for feature fusion to achieve multiple classification of defects based on infrared gas cylinder images. Compared with the mainstream classification methods DenseNet, ResNet, and VGG, the cascaded HRNet method improves the average AUC by 6.1\% and achieves the highest scores in two defect types. For temperature fluctuation experiments under real working conditions, good performance is achieved, proving the effectiveness and anti-interference of the improved model.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has garnered widespread attention due to its ability to automatically generate diverse and valuable digital content. Integrating with AIGC, vehicular networks are evolving as the next-generation intelligent transportation system, i.e., vehicular Metaverses, which can significantly enrich the diverse and personalized immersive experience of vehicular applications for drivers and passengers. Nevertheless, due to the high demand for AIGC services and the limited coverage of RoadSide Units (RSUs), it is still challenging to efficiently allocate RSU resources for massive vehicular users. In this paper, we propose an attribute-aware auction-based mechanism for real-time resource allocation in vehicular AIGC services, which considers both price and non-monetary attributes. In this mechanism, we first formulate the resource-attribute matching problem as a weighted bipartite graph to determine potential market participants. Then, we train an auctioneer in a double Dutch auction using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to adjust the auction clocks efficiently during the clock adjustment process. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed DRL-based auction scheme outperforms existing baseline schemes in terms of average cumulative reward, convergence speed, social welfare, and auction information exchange costs.},

In this paper, we propose an EfficientNet-B3 network optimization model based on the CBAM attention mechanism, which significantly improves the recognition of tiny defects in solar panels by combining deep learning techniques and attention mechanisms. Experimental results show that our model exhibits high accuracy on both training and validation sets with gradually decreasing loss. The model achieves an accuracy of 95.22\% in complex and variable defect categories, which is significantly better than existing baseline models. An in-depth performance evaluation shows that the model has significant advantages in key performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 value, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in the solar panel defect recognition task.},

Therefore, we have designed an innovative web front-end development course training platform that combines the automation generation ability of generative artificial intelligence and the fast construction advantage of low code development. In platform design, we fully utilize the automated generation capability of generative artificial intelligence to achieve intelligent generation and layout optimization of front-end page elements. At the same time, with the help of the visual programming interface and component-based development methods of low code development platforms, the front-end development process is simplified, the technical threshold is lowered, and students can focus more on the implementation of business logic and creative expression.},

As more creative tools begin to incorporate generative artificial intelligence, I propose a research agenda that centers the design of human-AI co-creation experiences on disabled creators and leverages such technology for accessibility from the start. Specifically, I focus on researching ways that AI-assisted creative tools could be designed to lift the expression ceiling and reduce effort for blind and low vision creators. Starting with a formative mixed-method study that uncovers the blind and low vision community's needs for visual content creation and editing support, this dissertation explores and designs accessible content creation support for three highly desired visual creative tasks: (1) private visual content obfuscation, (2) social media video editing, and (3) aesthetic visual content authoring. Together, I believe this dissertation will contribute actionable insights to lower the barriers to expressive and efficient digital content creation for blind and low vision creators.},

  abstract = {We are concurrently witnessing two significant shifts: voice and chat-based conversational user interfaces (CUIs) are becoming ubiquitous (especially more recently due to advances in generative AI and LLMs - large language models), and older people are becoming a very large demographic group (and increasingly adopting of mobile technology on which such interfaces are present). However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research.},

  abstract = {Academic writing is one of the most important tasks in Academia. The pressure to "publish or perish" drives researchers to use all the tools available to try to improve their papers and their impact. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) that can create content such as text, tables, and images can be used for many tasks in academic writing such as summarizing, translating, paraphrasing, data analysis, and presentation. Therefore, AI is expected to be widely used in academic writing in the near future and have a significant impact. Understanding this impact is far from trivial and needs to be carefully studied. The first step in doing so is to be able to identify papers written with the help of AI tools. This can be done by adding metadata on the use of AI in academic results. In this paper, we embark on an initial endeavor to devise such metadata and delineate the potential advantages that the inclusion of AI-related metadata in academic publications may bring forth.},

However, this presents unique challenges, including the need for effective interactive collaboration and access to diverse skill sets of members in the software development team. To address these problems, we present ''DevCoach'', an online system designed to support students learning the SDLC at scale by interacting with generative agents powered by large language models simulating members with different roles in a software development team. Our preliminary user study results reveal that DevCoach improves the experiences and outcomes for students, with regard to learning concepts in SDLC's ''Plan and Design'' and ''Develop'' phases. We aim to use our findings to enhance DevCoach to support the entire SDLC workflow by incorporating additional simulated roles and enabling students to choose their project topics. Future studies will be conducted in an online Software Engineering class at our institution, aiming to explore and inspire the development of intelligent systems that provide comprehensive SDLC learning experiences to students at scale.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, Generative Large Language Models (GLLMs) have made a significant impact in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). One of the domains extensively explored for these models is their ability as generators of functional source code for software projects. Nevertheless, their potential as assistants to write the code needed to generate and model Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) architectures has not been fully explored to date. For this reason, this work focuses on evaluating the extent to which different tools based on GLLMs, such as ChatGPT or Copilot, are able to correctly define the source code necessary to generate viable predictive models. The use case defined is the forecasting of a time series that reports the indoor temperature of a greenhouse. The results indicate that, while it is possible to achieve good accuracy metrics with simple predictive models generated by GLLMs, the composition of predictive models with complex architectures using GLLMs is still far from improving the accuracy of predictive models generated by human data scientists.},

Current text-to-audio models offer a novel method of defining sounds, which we aim to render utilizable in a music-production environment. Selected pretrained latent diffusion models, enable the synthesis of playable sounds through textual descriptions, which we incorporated into a digital instrument that integrates with standard music production tools. The resultant user interface not only allows generating but also modifying the sounds by editing model and instrument-specific parameters. We evaluated the applicability of current diffusion models with their parameters as well as the fitness of possible prompts for music production scenarios. Adapting published diffusion model pipelines for integration into the instrument, we facilitate experimentation and exploration of this innovative sound synthesis method. Our findings show that despite facing some limitations in the models' responsiveness to specific music production contexts and the instrument's functionality, the tool allows the development of novel and intriguing soundscapes.

To bring AI closer to how programmers think, behave, and interact, it is imperative for research to establish a clear connection between various human factors that lead to its adoption. Using a model based on the Theory of Reasoned Action, we positioned human traits of academic stress, risk propensity, neuroticism, and computer self-efficacy as factors that positively influence attitudes toward the use of AI in programming among university students. We further posited that attitude and social norms lead to the behavioral intention to use AI in programming. We used PLS-SEM to analyze responses from 131 programming students who use ChatGPT to accomplish learning tasks. We found that both academic stress and computer self-efficacy influence attitudes toward using AI in programming. While attitude positively influences the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT, we found that risk propensity and neuroticism do not affect attitude, and social norms do not influence behavioral intention. We discuss the implications of our investigation to the industry and the academe.},

  abstract = {To improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on domain specific applications, ML developers often leverage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM Fine-Tuning. RAG extends the capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, without the need to retrain the model. On the other hand, Fine-Tuning approach updates LLM weights with domain-specific data to improve performance on specific tasks. The fine-tuned model is particularly effective to systematically learn new comprehensive knowledge in a specific domain that is not covered by the LLM pre-training. This tutorial walks through the RAG and Fine-Tuning techniques, discusses the insights of their advantages and limitations, and provides best practices of adopting the methodologies for the LLM tasks and use cases.

  abstract = {The boom in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and continuing growth of Voice Assistants (VAs) suggests their trajectories will converge. This conjecture aligns with the development of AI-driven conversational agents, aiming to utilise advance natural language processing (NLP) methods to enhance the capabilities of voice assistants. However, design guidelines for VAs prioritise maximum efficiency by advocating for the use of concise answers. This poses a conflict with the challenges around generative AI, such as inaccuracies and misinterpretation, as shorter responses may not adequately provide users with meaningful information. AI-VA systems can adapt drivers of trust formation, such as references and authorship, to improve credibility. A better understanding of user behaviour when using the system is needed to develop revised design recommendations for AI-powered VA systems. This paper reports an online survey of 256 participants residing in the U.K. and nine follow-up interviews, where user behaviour is investigated to identify drivers of trust in the context of obtaining digital information from a generative AI-based VA system. Adding references is promising as a tool for increasing trust in systems producing text, yet we found no evidence that the inclusion of references in a VA response contributed towards the perceived reliability or trust towards the system. We examine further variables driving user trust in AI-powered VA systems.},

  abstract = {Most recent algorithms of RGB-T salient object detection have two issues remain unresolved. The first one is that existing methods don't fully explore and exploit the potentials of complementary of different modalities and multi-type cues of images, which play a vital role in achieving accurate results. And the second is that it is difficult to determine which of the two modalities contributes more in the feature fusion stage.To address these problems, we propose a dual-decoder importance-aware gated network called LNet. Specifically, we set the dual-decoder architecture to solve the cross-modality interaction problem. It can dig out the characteristics of two modalities, and fuse the cross-modality complementarity information more effectively. In particular, the importance-aware gated part Screening Mechanism (SM) can suppress saliency bias and let model avoid obtaining the results dominated by one modality.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LNet achieves better performance than the 11 state-of-the-art on three public datasets.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is versatile for various applications, but security and privacy concerns with third-party AI vendors hinder its broader adoption in sensitive scenarios. Hence, it is essential for users to validate the AI trustworthiness and ensure the security of data boundaries. In this paper, we present a dye testing system named Dye4AI, which injects crafted trigger data into human-AI dialogue and observes AI responses towards specific prompts to diagnose data flow in AI model evolution. Our dye testing procedure contains 3 stages: trigger generation, trigger insertion, and trigger retrieval. First, to retain both uniqueness and stealthiness, we design a new trigger that transforms a pseudo-random number to a intelligible format. Second, with a custom-designed three-step conversation strategy, we insert each trigger item into dialogue and confirm the model memorizes the new trigger knowledge in the current session. Finally, we routinely try to recover triggers with specific prompts in new sessions, as triggers can present in new sessions only if AI vendors leverage user data for model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on six LLMs demonstrate our dye testing scheme is effective in ensuring the data boundary, even for models with various architectures and parameter sizes. Also, larger and premier models tend to be more suitable for Dye4AI, e.g., trigger can be retrieved in OpenLLaMa-13B even with only 2 insertions per trigger item. Moreover, we analyze the prompt selection in dye testing, providing insights for future testing systems on generative AI services.},

We surveyed all computer science majors in a small engineering-focused R1 university in order to: (1) capture a baseline assessment of how GenAI has been immediately adopted by aspiring computer scientists; (2) describe computing students' GenAI-related needs and concerns for their education and careers; and (3) discuss GenAI influences on CS pedagogy, curriculum, culture, and policy. We present an exploratory qualitative analysis of this data and discuss the impact of our findings on the emerging conversation around GenAI and education.},

  abstract = {AI/ML techniques have been used to solve systems problems, but their applicability to customize solutions on-the-fly has been limited. Traditionally, any customization required manually changing the AI/ML model or modifying the code, configuration parameters, application settings, etc. This incurs too much time and effort, and is very painful. In this paper, we propose a novel technique using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology, wherein instructions can be provided in natural language and actual code to handle any customization is automatically generated, integrated and applied on-the-fly. Such capability is extremely powerful since it makes customization of application settings or solution techniques super easy. Specifically, we propose ECO-LLM (LLM-based Edge Cloud Optimization), which leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to dynamically adjust placement of application tasks across edge and cloud computing tiers, in response to changes in application workload, such that insights are delivered quickly with low cost of operation (systems problem). Our experiments with real-world video analytics applications i.e. face recognition, human attributes detection and license plate recognition show that ECO-LLM is able to automatically generate code on-the-fly and adapt placement of application tasks across edge and cloud computing tiers. We note that the trigger workload (to switch between edge and cloud) for ECO-LLM is exactly the same as the baseline (manual) and actual placement performed by ECO-LLM is only slightly different i.e. on average (across 2 days) only 1.45\% difference in human attributes detection and face recognition, and 1.11\% difference in license plate recognition. Although we tackle this specific systems problem in this paper, our proposed GenAI-based technique is applicable to solve other systems problems too.},

  abstract = {As deep learning technology in computer science develops, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has shown great potential in automated essay scoring (AES). Prompts and time are important factors which may influence the performance of GenAI. The study selected 52 English argumentative essays, designed five different prompts, chooses two different time points, and then utilized ChatGPT 4 to explore the effects of prompts and time on AES by GenAI. Besides, possible reasons for large difference between human and GenAI score were discussed.For different prompts, results show that the one-shot prompt performs better in AES compared with the other four prompts. It provides background information and a scoring example to ChatGPT. The scores generated by it do not significantly differ from the human scores. They significantly and positively correlate with human scores (ρ = 0.424). The exact-plus-adjacent agreement (EPAA) rate for one-shot prompt scores reaches 69.23\%. For scores generated at different points in time, results reveal that although there is still a significant difference between scores generated after one week and human scores, the ChatGPT-Human EPAA rate becomes higher and the absolute value of mean score difference is smaller.Based on the analysis of selected essays, the major reason for large GenAI-Human score difference is that ChatGPT evaluates essays from limited perspectives to give its score, while human raters can comprehensively assess the quality of an essay. What's more, ChatGPT cannot keep the same scoring criteria during the rating process.The study aims to help people understand how to interact with GenAI more efficiently and take advantage of GenAI to meet the practical needs.},

Recent advanced generative Artificial Intelligence techniques, with the capability to generate substantial diverse and high-quality texts and visual content, offer an opportunity for personalized assistance in emotional learning for HFA children. Based on the findings of our formative study, we integrated large language models and text-to-image models to develop a tool named EmoEden supporting children with HFA. Over a 22-day study involving six HFA children, it is observed that EmoEden effectively engaged children and improved their emotional recognition and expression abilities. Additionally, we identified the advantages and potential risks of applying generative AI to assist HFA children in emotional learning.},

  abstract = {As an indispensable and easily damaged part in large equipment, bearings were of great significance for their rapid and accurate fault diagnosis. The working environment of bearings was usually harsh and complicated. In order to improve the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis under strong noise, an improved IRGShuffleNet network structure was proposed. The initial multi-scale structure based on LIBP was innovatively used to extract the shallow feature information of the network. Features were extracted from high-dimensional data using the inverted residual structure, and redundant feature maps were generated in a cheaper way by Ghost convolution. Random depth structure and flooding regularization were used to prevent overfitting of the model. To evaluate the validity of the proposed model, a series of comparative experiments were conducted. Compared with the standard residual network, the accuracy of the model proposed in this paper was improved by 5.90\% and 9.72\% respectively under -4dB and -10dB noise. The model parameter was reduced from 25.7M to 1.98M, FLOPs were reduced by about 75.2\%, and other performance indicators were also improved at different amplitudes. These results showed that the proposed model had good diagnostic adaptability.},

In particular, text-to-image generation models offer a novel approach to guiding the image generation process using natural language input, which is inspiring for multimodal search advertising. Traditional multimodal search ads require advertisers to prepare ad creatives, such as ad images, which is time-consuming and requires uniform image specifications and content quality inspection. To this end, we propose a streamlined generation framework for search ad image creatives. First, we prepare a Chinese image caption model with high-quality image-caption pairs to bootstrap training data refinement. With curated high-quality images and synthesized descriptive captions, we then train a Chinese text-to-image generation model, the largest to date, using SDXL and a 10-billion multimodal text encoder. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage bilingual multimodal representation alignment process to seamlessly integrate the text encoder with the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, including assessments of image captioning and image generation. The implementation of our framework in Baidu Search Ads shows significant revenue increase, For example, beauty industry ads with generated image creatives achieve a 29\% higher click-through rate (CTR).},

However, most existing approaches rely on single-agent systems, which fail to fully utilize the collaborative potential of multiple AI agents. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent collaboration system designed to enhance decision-making in financial investment research. The system incorporates agent groups with both configurable group sizes and collaboration structures to leverage the strengths of each agent group type. By utilizing a sub-optimal combination strategy, the system dynamically adapts to varying market conditions and investment scenarios, optimizing performance across different tasks. We focus on three sub-tasks: fundamentals, market sentiment, and risk analysis, by analyzing the 2023 SEC 10-K forms of 30 companies listed on the Dow Jones Index. Our findings reveal significant performance variations based on the configurations of AI agents for different tasks. The results demonstrate that our multi-agent collaboration system outperforms traditional single-agent models, offering improved accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability in complex financial environments. This study highlights the potential of multi-agent systems in transforming financial analysis and investment decision-making by integrating diverse analytical perspectives.},

  abstract = {The rise in capability and ubiquity of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has enabled its application to the field of Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs). Despite significant interest in leveraging modern AI-powered components in real-time SIA research, substantial friction remains due to the absence of a standardized and universal SIA framework. As such, we developed Estuary: a multimodal (text, audio, and soon video) framework which facilitates the development of low-latency, real-time SIAs. Estuary seeks to reduce repeat work between studies and to provide a flexible platform that can be run entirely off-cloud to maximize configurability, controllability, reproducibility of studies, and speed of agent response times. We achieve this by constructing a robust multimodal framework which incorporates current and future components seamlessly into a modular and interoperable architecture.},

  abstract = {Persuasive technologies, which are intended to change users’ attitudes or behaviors and encourage specific actions, are widely applied across various domains. However, the fine line between persuasion and coercion raises significant ethical concerns, which current literature only superficially addresses. This paper aims to deepen the understanding of factors influencing the ethical perception of persuasive technologies through a systematic literature review of 17 journal articles. The selected studies were analyzed using content analysis to identify key ethical factors. The findings indicate that factors such as autonomy, consent, data privacy, transparency, and addictive design strategies significantly influence users’ ethical perceptions across multiple application domains. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies or AI agents, particularly applications like argumentative chatbots and storytelling robots, exhibit the highest number of ethical considerations. The study also notes thematic overlaps among many ethical factors, with the context and use case impacting ethical perceptions. Based on these results, this paper offers design recommendations and suggestions for the design of ethical persuasive technology applications.},

  abstract = {Designing effective cybersecurity visualization has become a crucial component of cyber defense strategies in many domains and industrial environments. Human behaviour, modeling and input are major aspects of designing visualization systems. Yet, the task of evaluating these developed visualization systems is both time-consuming and challenging, and it is often prone to cases where user evaluation is limited owing to a lack of different stakeholders and end users during the design process. Recognizing the potential of advanced Generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs), our study aims to explore their capabilities in evaluating web-based security visualization tools and dashboards, particularly in the context of smart cities and buildings. We study and compare the feasibility of using various LLMs available today, for conducting usability testing, serving as an additional resource given the limited availability of human participants. In particular, we focus on three different LLMs: Bing Chat, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4o. While each had its strengths and drawbacks, our findings revealed that the results obtained had a strong correlation with human test subjects. LLMs can be a valuable aid during evaluation, by offering in-depth insights and evaluations, tailored to the specific requirements of smart buildings, cities and automation cybersecurity. Moreover, our research and findings also reveal that LLMs can similarly be used for the evaluation of a wide range of other visual systems for industrial environments.},

  abstract = {The rapidly increasing amount of online information and the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) make the manual verification of information impractical. Consequently, AI systems are deployed to detect disinformation and deepfakes. Prior studies have indicated that combining AI and human capabilities yields enhanced performance in detecting disinformation. Furthermore, the European Union (EU) AI Act mandates human supervision for AI applications in areas impacting essential human rights, like freedom of speech, necessitating that AI systems be transparent and provide adequate explanations to ensure comprehensibility. Extensive research has been conducted on incorporating explainability (XAI) attributes to augment AI transparency, yet these often miss a human-centric assessment. The effectiveness of such explanations also varies with the user’s prior knowledge and personal attributes. Therefore, we developed a framework for validating XAI features for the collaborative human-AI fact-checking task. The framework allows the testing of XAI features with objective and subjective evaluation dimensions and follows human-centric design principles when displaying information about the AI system to the users. The framework was tested in a crowdsourcing experiment with 433 participants, including 406 crowdworkers and 27 journalists for the collaborative disinformation detection task. The tested XAI features increase the AI system’s perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust. With this publication, the XAI evaluation framework is made open source.},

By applying advanced intelligent algorithms of artificial intelligence, verb recognition can be better processed and the quality and accuracy of MT can be improved. Based on Neural machine translation (NMT), basic attention mechanisms, historical attention information, dynamically obtain information related to the generated words, and constraint mechanisms were introduced to embed semantic information, represent polysemy, and annotate semantic roles of verbs. This article used the Workshop on MT (WMT), British National Corpus (BNC), Gutenberg, Reuters Corpus, and OpenSubtitles corpus, and enhanced the data in the corpora. The improved NMT model was compared with traditional NMT models, Rule-Based MT (RBMT), and Statistical MT (SMT). The experimental results showed that the average verb semantic matching degree of the improved NMT model in five corpora was 0.85, and the average Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score in five corpora was 0.90. The improved NMT model in this article can effectively improve the accuracy of verb recognition in MT, providing new methods for verb recognition in MT.},

Yet we know little about the designers’ perceptions and practices of collaborating with generative AI as a co-creative agent within the context of multi-stakeholder participation. To investigate these questions, we took the domain of avatar design as an example and conducted a qualitative interview study with 21 expert avatar designers who have got different levels of experience and expertise in utilizing generative AI tools in their design workflow. We found that designers not only would fall in a dilemma when deciding whether to consider AI as a co-creative agent according to different stakeholders’ interests, but they also face many challenges in effectively co-creating with the current systems, including challenges in consistently adjusting AI outputs and getting design inspiration within the iterative generation process, etc. Based on our findings, we concluded both the epistemological and creative patterns of collaborating with generative AI and highlighted several design opportunities from both technical and ethical perspectives to better support future designer-AI co-creation.},

Drawing on a previous analysis of opportunities to support care in later life through an ecological carescape framework, workshops captured precarious visions, generational perspectives, and potential ways of reconfiguring care futures.

Through an analysis of 28 selected studies, this review provides a snapshot of the landscape in mid-2024, presenting benefits, concerns, and recommendations surrounding the use of generative artificial intelligence within programming education. It finds insufficient guidance on how to implement recommended pedagogical strategies, limited consideration of student perceptions and experiences, and a predominance of short study time frames. Additionally, there is a significant research gap in second-level education, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The paper discusses how these gaps signal a need for more human-centered approaches in the current research.

  abstract = {The continuous advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) enable designers to efficiently obtain vast amounts of inspirational materials during the design conception phase. Various modalities of stimuli can impact designers’ creativity. However, the relationship between the sequence of different modalities (Text, Images, and Virtual Models) and creativity remains to be explored. In this study, we investigate the effects of 6 sequential combinations of 3 modalities on designers’ creativity. Designers (N=36) used the creative stimulation platform InspireMe, accessing inspirational stimuli in various sequences to execute their design tasks. We analyzed the impact on creativity through assessments of work innovation and user interviews. The findings indicate that the sequence of material combinations significantly influences designers’ creativity, with varying impacts on the different sub-attributes of creativity. Drawing on experimental findings and qualitative research, this paper introduces a creativity demand-matching inspirational stimulation interaction strategy—the CDI strategy—that assists designers in developing more targeted design solutions. Furthermore, we propose the 3C Framework, a design strategy for creativity stimulation platforms aimed at designers in the intelligent era. This framework aims to guide the development of creative stimulation platforms for designers in the intelligent era.},

  abstract = {Although various methods have been proposed to improve the robustness of deep neural network models, evaluating these models in a fair and reasonable manner remains a challenge. Existing evaluation methods often consider only limited types of attacks, ignoring the generalization performance against new types of attacks, and fail to cover the most advanced defense models. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework to evaluate model robustness under different types of attacks. This framework integrates non-Lp and Lp attacks, and comprehensively evaluates the robustness of various advanced robust models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet subsets. Experimental results show that even the most advanced defense models exhibit vulnerabilities under certain new types of attacks, highlighting the importance of developing more comprehensive robustness benchmarks and providing guidance for the design of future robust deep learning models.},

  abstract = {Music-based reminiscence has the potential to positively impact the psychological well-being of older adults. However, the aging process and physiological changes, such as memory decline and limited verbal communication, may impede the ability of older adults to recall their memories and life experiences. Given the advanced capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as generated conversations and images, and their potential to facilitate the reminiscing process, this study aims to explore the design of generative AI to support music-based reminiscence in older adults. This study follows a user-centered design approach incorporating various stages, including detailed interviews with two social workers and two design workshops (involving ten older adults). Our work contributes to an in-depth understanding of older adults’ attitudes toward utilizing generative AI for supporting music-based reminiscence and identifies concrete design considerations for the future design of generative AI to enhance the reminiscence experience of older adults.},

We initiated the study by considering the traditional AT-making processes performed by OTs and prototyped a web interface that incorporates generative AI to support these processes. Through a series of user studies, we collected OTs' preliminary insights on how generative AI could bridge the gap between clinical reasoning and technical design, potentially streamlining the AT creation and adaptation process while maintaining the crucial element of personalized AT solutions. The study's findings highlight several key benefits of generative AI in OT practice: 1) customization of AT solutions tailored to individual client needs, 2) improved visualization capabilities for client communication, 3) inspiration for new AT design ideas, and 4) potential for rapid prototyping and practice. However, key drawbacks were noted, including limitations in inputting measurements, which can lead to inaccurate outputs and necessitate substantial modifications to the created AT, along with challenges associated with the current state of generative AI.},

  abstract = {The Air Quality Index (AQI) is an effective measure of air quality, and accurate prediction of the AQI is important for air pollution control and the daily travel of people. Air pollutants have strong spatio-temporal correlation, and the current air quality prediction methods often fail to adequately extract the spatio-temporal features in the data, which can cause prediction accuracy problems. This paper proposed a Self-Tuning Spatio-Temporal Residual Network (AAM-AST2RN) fusing adaptive adjacency matrix and attention mechanism for enhanced air quality prediction. AAM-AST2RN utilized a parallel network structure, which was capable of fully extracting and fusing spatio-temporal features and automatically adjusting the network hyperparameters. In addition, the AAM-AST2RN model constructed the AAM generation module, residual connection and Improved Channel Attention mechanism (ICA), the AAM generation module avoided the adverse effect of static adjacency matrix on the model feature extraction, the residual connection and ICA effectively alleviated the node feature over-smoothing problem caused by Graph Convolutional neural Network (GCN) in the model and improved the node feature differentiation. In order to validate the model effect, the model was utilized to predict the AQI of 12 air monitoring sites in Beijing, and compared with the prediction effect of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory neural network (ConvLSTM), combined Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory neural network (CNN-LSTM), and GCN-LSTM. Compared with the above three spatio-temporal prediction models, the coefficient of determination (R2) of the AAM-AST2RN model was improved by 11.30\%, 1.95\%, and 1.54\%, respectively, and the prediction error was lower. The AAM-AST2RN air quality prediction model proposed in this paper can fully extract the spatio-temporal features in the data and has a good prediction performance for air quality.},

Furthermore, if the system finds that the 3D asset library lacks appropriate device representations, it will automatically use a 3D mesh generator to create new ones.

  abstract = {In order to solve the problem of low segmentation accuracy due to the interference of noise information such as light and shadow in the current lightweight blind segmentation model, we propose a fast tactile paving segmentation model based on reparameterize. The multi-branch training structure learns spatial features such as tactile paving, light and shadow while compensating for the loss of information in the feature map due to downsampling operations as well as enhancing the learning of its features in the channel dimension. The single-branch structure obtained after reparameterization of the multibranch structure ensures faster inference of the model as well as lower memory access costs. The introduction of coordinate attention allows the model to learn the distribution law of the features of tactile paving, light and shadow, etc. in the spatial dimension and automatically generate the attention map with weight information, effectively reducing the weight of the spatial structural features of noise such as light and shadow. Experiments show that the model's ability to resist interference from environmental noise such as light and shadow has been enhanced and the segmentation accuracy has been further improved under the premise of ensuring the inference speed.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have shown incredible promise for zero shot image-to-image translation and editing. Most of these approaches work by combining or replacing network-specific features used in the generation of new images with those taken from the inversion of some guide image. Methods of this type are considered the current state-of-the-art in training-free approaches, but have some notable limitations: they tend to be costly in runtime and memory, and often depend on deterministic sampling that limits variation in generated results. We propose Filter-Guided Diffusion (FGD), an alternative approach that leverages fast filtering operations during the diffusion process to support finer control over the strength and frequencies of guidance and can work with non-deterministic samplers to produce greater variety. With its efficiency, FGD can be sampled over multiple seeds and hyperparameters in less time than a single run of other SOTA methods to produce superior results based on structural and semantic metrics. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments to evaluate the performance of FGD in translation tasks and also demonstrate its potential in localized editing when used with masks.},

  abstract = {Attack-defense trees, an extension of attack trees, are extensively used by security engineers to document potential countermeasures for security threats present in a system's design. These trees help integrate initial system models with countermeasures, allowing for early testing of their efficiency and impact in the design cycle. Despite advancements in automating attack tree construction, selecting the initial set of countermeasures for conversion into an attack-defense tree remains largely manual. This paper proposes an approach and a tool that extends the TTool-AI attack tree generation feature by leveraging large language models and natural language processing to create a set of countermeasures and generate attack-defense trees based on an input attack tree. To evaluate our contribution, our approach is tested using attack-defense trees generated from attack trees, each representing possible threats to an associated system specification. In addition, we introduce metrics to assess the semantic correctness and completeness of the generated attack-defense trees. We compared, using our metrics, the attack-defense trees created from our methodology to those created by an engineer and found that attack-defense trees created using AI and secondary mitigation data provided better trees than solely using AI. We also discovered that this approach generated trees that were comparable to the quality of attack-defense trees generated from a security engineer at the associate level. From these results, we believe that our contribution could aid engineers in identifying not only appropriate countermeasures for attack trees but also the optimal number of countermeasures, avoiding the complexity of redundant mitigations. Furthermore, our approach complements standard modeling practices, particularly during the initial design phase, reducing the need for time-consuming re-engineering throughout the system's lifecycle.},

  abstract = {Voting advice applications (VAAs) are pivotal web-based tools that guide citizens to align with political parties and candidates that match their preferences. Traditional methods for creating candidate profiles predominantly rely on questionnaire responses, a time-intensive and costly process. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-centric methodology utilizing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), culminating in creating political avatars. These political avatars are engineered using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 and Bard. They are adept at processing and interpreting data primarily sourced from Twitter and leveraging bespoke, self-trained datasets. Integrating advanced AI technology with diverse data sources equips political avatars with unprecedented analytical and predictive capabilities, setting a new standard in political analysis. Unlike traditional methods, political avatars are adept at emulating the responses of real politicians or experts, showcasing a remarkable capacity to interact with VAA surveys. This novel approach presents the potential to either compete with or enhance the insights traditionally obtained from human experts. Another critical aspect of our study is comparing political avatars and previous research employing question-answering (QA) models based on advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for political profiling. This comparative analysis reveals that Political Avatars offer a significantly more robust solution for profile construction. While QA models provide structured responses based on specific queries, political avatars bring an element of dynamism and depth, capable of generating nuanced, context-aware responses. This shift from static, questionnaire-based profiling to dynamic, AI-driven avatars marks a substantial leap in political analysis. Generative AI in crafting Political Avatars introduces a transformative element to data analysis. This approach facilitates a layered and more sophisticated interpretation of political stances, moving beyond the limitations of traditional profiling methods. By employing political avatars, our methodology not only streamlines the profiling process but also enriches the quality of insights derived, paving the way for a more nuanced understanding of the political landscape.},

While Generative AI has a multitude of exciting applications for the fields of writing, coding, and graphic design, its usage to personalize our virtual space has not yet been explored. In this paper, we investigate the application of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) to personalize our virtual spaces and enhance the metaverse experience. To this end, we present a pipeline to enable users to customize their virtual spaces. Moreover, we explore the hardware resources and latency required for personalized spaces, as well as user acceptance of the AI-generated spaces. Comprehensive user studies follow extensive system experiments. Our research evaluates users' perceptions of two generated spaces: panoramic images and 3D virtual spaces. According to our findings, users have shown a great interest in 3D personalized spaces, and the practicality and immersion of 3D space generation tools surpass panoramic space generation tools.},

  abstract = {As a result of the prominence of generative artificial intelligence across diverse fields, it has become necessary for governments to develop national strategies for directing the ethical use of artificial intelligence to respect fundamental human values. This paper explores the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in technology sovereignty, its contributions, and benefits for the government, associated risks, and challenges, and how it influences government policies. It begins with examining GAI's capabilities to comprehend how it understands natural language, trains on existing data, and generates realistic outputs, followed by a discussion of its potential benefits for governments that enable them to act independently and autonomously in diverse sectors. It highlights how it can empower them to administer technological ecosystems, promote domestic innovation, and facilitate policy-making processes. However, contrary to its benefits, GAI is also capable of inflicting negative consequences on society. Therefore, the paper also addresses the risks and challenges associated with GAI that necessitate reflection on existing policies and developing new ones that align with a nation's legal frameworks. Exploring the influence of GAI on government policies, the paper highlights the significance of collaboration in policy-making endeavors to ensure ethical future developments and bring value to public interest and democratic values. This comprehensive analysis aims to shed light on the responsible and ethical use of GAI to preserve human rights, promote economic growth, sustain social justice, and inform the responsible use of GAI within the framework of technology sovereignty.},

  abstract = {This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI), and - among other approaches - particularly to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. Following successful workshops in 2022 and 2023, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

One pathway forward is through creativity, a process crucial for learning and also connected to the act of using gen-AI. This poster demonstrates the results of a study designed to provide an in-depth view on how creativity intersects with gen-AI usage in a computational physics course. In the course, students learn about computing tools during group-based, open-ended computational physics activities. Students are often tasked with using gen-AI to explore and help make decisions.

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies like generative AI solutions are proliferating in the real-world healthcare sector. The purpose of this research is to investigate social norms, expectations, and standards of the elderly population for improving trust relationships while interacting with generative AI. The study is based on the CASA paradigm to gain a better understanding of the trust dynamics in human-computer communication to improve the adoption of GAI for elders' health and well-being. We validated the conceptual model with empirical data from 287 elderly users collected through an online and offline survey tool. Quantitative responses received were analysed using structural equation modeling. The study highlights how multimodal interaction, empathy, personalization, augmentation, bias stereotyping, and privacy and security affect the extent to which elderly consumers perceive GAI as trustworthy. Findings indicate that multimodal interaction, personalization, augmentation, and bias stereotyping significantly influenced the trust relationship between the elderly population and GAI. However, empathy privacy, and security were found to be insignificant in trust relationships. Further trust relationships significantly impacted GAI usage. The research provides strong theoretical and practical implications as all the stakeholders like healthcare professionals, patients/users, caregivers, and technology developers can be involved in building applications that cater to diverse needs and promote positive social interactions that can enhance GAI trust and usage.},

  abstract = {Video streaming stands as the cornerstone of telecommunication networks, constituting over 60\% of mobile data traffic as of June 2023. The paramount challenge faced by video streaming service providers is ensuring high Quality of Experience (QoE) for users. In HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS), including DASH and HLS, video content is encoded at multiple quality versions, with an Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithm dynamically selecting versions based on network conditions. Concurrently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the industry, particularly in content recommendation and personalization. Leveraging user data and advanced algorithms, AI enhances user engagement, satisfaction, and video quality through super-resolution and denoising techniques.However, challenges persist, such as real-time processing on resource-constrained devices, the need for diverse training datasets, privacy concerns, and model interpretability. Despite these hurdles, the promise of Generative Artificial Intelligence emerges as a transformative force. Generative AI, capable of synthesizing new data based on learned patterns, holds vast potential in the video streaming landscape. In the context of video streaming, it can create realistic and immersive content, adapt in real time to individual preferences, and optimize video compression for seamless streaming in low-bandwidth conditions.This research proposal outlines a comprehensive exploration at the intersection of advanced AI algorithms and digital entertainment, focusing on the potential of generative AI to elevate video quality, user interactivity, and the overall streaming experience. The objective is to integrate generative models into video streaming pipelines, unraveling novel avenues that promise a future of dynamic, personalized, and visually captivating streaming experiences for viewers.},

  abstract = {Self-adaptive systems (SASs) are designed to handle changes and uncertainties through a feedback loop with four core functionalities: monitoring, analyzing, planning, and execution. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this article aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI’s within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies.†},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models introduced challenges for educators, students and administrators across the academic sphere related to how to manage and regulate these tools. While some oppose their use, many researchers have begun to approach the topic of educational AI use from a different perspective. Despite being in its early stages; this field of research has produced notable insights into the capabilities and limitations of models like ChatGPT. This paper utilizes a SWOT analysis framework to analyze and consolidate existing literature, with a specific focus on Computer Science education. Through the analysis of this literature, we have created a set of use cases and guidelines to aid in the future development of strategies and tools within this field. Our findings indicate that while some concerns are valid, such as AI's ability to generate plagiarized work, we identified several promising avenues and opportunities for careful integration of this technology into education.},

  abstract = {Technological intervention to support care areas that some people may not have access to is of paramount importance to promote sustainable development of good health and wellbeing. This study aims to explore the linguistic similarities and differences between human professionals and Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) conversational agents in therapeutic dialogues. Initially, the MISTRAL-7B Large Language Model (LLM) is instructed to generate responses to patient queries to form a synthetic equivalent to a publicly available psychology dataset. A large set of linguistic features (e.g., text metrics, lexical diversity and richness, readability scores, sentiment, emotions, and named entities) is extracted and studied from both the expert and synthetically-generated text. The results suggest a significantly richer vocabulary in humans than the LLM approach. Similarly, the use of sentiment was significantly different between the two, suggesting a difference in the supportive or objective language used and that synthetic linguistic expressions of emotion may differ from those expressed by an intelligent being. However, no statistical significance was observed between human professionals and AI in the use of function words, pronouns and several named entities; possibly reflecting an increased proficiency of LLMs in modelling some language patterns, even in a specialised context (i.e., therapy). However, current findings do not support the similarity in sentimental nuance and emotional expression, which limits the effectiveness of contemporary LLMs as standalone agents. Further development is needed towards clinically validated algorithms.},

While prior research has examined GenAI from a techno-centric perspective, there is still a lack of understanding about how users perceive and utilize GenAI in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with (N = 18) GenAI users in creative industries, investigating the human-GenAI co-creation process within a holistic LUA (Learning, Using and Assessing) framework. Our study uncovered an intriguingly complex landscape: Prospects – GenAI greatly fosters the co-creation between human expertise and GenAI capabilities, profoundly transforming creative workflows; Challenges – Meanwhile, users face substantial uncertainties and complexities arising from resource availability, tool usability, and regulatory compliance; Strategies – In response, users actively devise various strategies to overcome many of such challenges. Our study reveals key implications for the design of future GenAI tools.},

This study explores the congruence between online course descriptions and actual course syllabi to improve course preparation and consistency for instructors. Alignment between course catalog descriptions and actual course content as detailed in the syllabus can lead to learning improvements, student satisfaction, and academic alignment in a program. Our research introduces a novel framework utilizing GAI to systematically evaluates and identifies mismatches and suggests content to close the gap between online course descriptions and syllabus content. We used OpenAI’s ChatGPT to extract key topics from course syllabi and assessed the congruence between results and course description content with embedding methods such as BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT, coupled with cosine similarity metrics. Our framework also integrates an outlier detection algorithm to identify courses with significant misalignments and use GAI applications to refine and enhance course catalog descriptions. This approach helps higher education institutions update course offerings with cutting-edge technology and contributes to curriculum development, helping improve student learning efficiency and course design.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), exemplified by ChatGPT, Midjourney, and other state-of-the-art large language models and diffusion models, holds significant potential for transforming education and enhancing human productivity. While the prevalence of GenAI in education has motivated numerous research initiatives, integrating these technologies within the learning analytics (LA) cycle and their implications for practical interventions remain underexplored. This paper delves into the prospective opportunities and challenges GenAI poses for advancing LA. We present a concise overview of the current GenAI landscape and contextualise its potential roles within Clow’s generic framework of the LA cycle. We posit that GenAI can play pivotal roles in analysing unstructured data, generating synthetic learner data, enriching multimodal learner interactions, advancing interactive and explanatory analytics, and facilitating personalisation and adaptive interventions. As the lines blur between learners and GenAI tools, a renewed understanding of learners is needed. Future research can delve deep into frameworks and methodologies that advocate for human-AI collaboration. The LA community can play a pivotal role in capturing data about human and AI contributions and exploring how they can collaborate most effectively. As LA advances, it is essential to consider the pedagogical implications and broader socioeconomic impact of GenAI for ensuring an inclusive future.},

  abstract = {The global ultra-wide display market is growing rapidly due to widespread consumer adoption. However, existing content, especially on TV screens, is mainly designed for lower aspect ratios like 4:3. As TVs shift towards wider formats, there’s a need to develop a method to transform legacy content and adapt to varying screen sizes. This shift holds the potential to revolutionize the content viewing experience for gamers, content creators, and streaming enthusiasts. While delivering high-quality visual content for dynamic aspect ratios remains a challenge, recent advancements in Deep Learning show promise in addressing these problems with generative approaches. Our contribution begins with a survey of prior video completion efforts, providing a foundational backdrop. We then introduce our novel solution, combining optical flow methodologies with generative latent diffusion models. These models, conditioned on an initial prompt and evolving video frame, refine content generation. We validate our approach on the DAVIS dataset, demonstrating its efficacy and robustness. In summary, our study pioneers advancements in content generation for ultra-wide displays.},

This article addresses the grand challenge of the implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in HCI, highlighting the importance of considering three main themes: interfaces and interaction paradigms; ethical approaches and design; and the promotion of equity, diversity, and inclusion. To tackle this challenge, we propose a research agenda in Brazil that encompasses short, medium, and long-term actions aimed at fostering AI development that is socially conscious and critical. We conclude by emphasizing the need to promote a profound understanding of AI’s effects on society through an integrated and multifaceted approach, aligned with human values. We invite the entire HCI community to collaborate in this effort, seeking to research and develop AI interfaces that enrich human interactions in an ethical and inclusive manner. This grand challenge paper is presented in two languages, first in English and then in Brazilian Portuguese.},

  abstract = {This work presents a structured view of the state-of-the-art research on Artificial Intelligence (AI), from the point of view of efficiency and reduction of the energy consumption of AI software. We analysed the current research on energy consumption of AI algorithms and its improvements, which gave us a starting literature corpus of 2,688 papers that we identified as Green AI with a software perspective. We structure this corpus into Green IN AI and Green BY AI, which led us to discover that only 36 of them could be considered Green IN AI. After some quick insights about Green BY AI, we then introduce our main contribution: a systematic mapping of Green IN AI. We provide an in-depth analysis of the AI models that we observed during the mapping, and what solutions have been proposed for improving their energy efficiency. We also analyse the energy evaluation methodologies employed in Green IN AI, discovering that most papers opt for a software-based energy estimation approach and 27\% of all papers do not document their methodology. We finish by synthetising our insights from the mapping into a Decalogue of Good Practices for Green AI.},

Traditional machine learning methods have achieved certain results in solving this problem, but generally ignore the continuous characteristics of malicious network behavior in time series. Aiming at this weakness, this paper proposes a Gated Unit Convolutional Networks (GUCN) model based on gated recurrent unit and convolutional neural network. Meanwhile, it also uses the feature screening method of random forest and the data dimension reduction method of UMAP to process the high dimensional data, which reduces the data redundancy. The results show that the method can effectively detect malicious network behavior, and because it can learn the objective characteristics of behavior in time series, it has the potential to identify malicious attack behavior in advance.},

  abstract = {The process of fashion design usually involves sketching, refining, and coloring, with designers drawing inspiration from various images to fuel their creative endeavors. However, conventional image search methods often yield irrelevant results, impeding the design process. Moreover, creating and coloring sketches can be time-consuming and demanding, acting as a bottleneck in the design workflow. In this work, we introduce HAIGEN (Human-AI Collaboration for GENeration), an efficient fashion design system for Human-AI collaboration developed to aid designers. Specifically, HAIGEN consists of four modules. T2IM, located in the cloud, generates reference inspiration images directly from text prompts. With three other modules situated locally, the I2SM batch generates the image material library into a certain designer-style sketch material library. The SRM recommends similar sketches in the generated library to designers for further refinement, and the STM colors the refined sketch according to the styles of inspiration images. Through our system, any designer can perform local personalized fine-tuning and leverage the powerful generation capabilities of large models in the cloud, streamlining the entire design development process. Given that our approach integrates both cloud and local model deployment schemes, it effectively safeguards design privacy by avoiding the need to upload personalized data from local designers. We validated the effectiveness of each module through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments. User surveys also confirmed that HAIGEN offers significant advantages in design efficiency, positioning it as a new generation of aid-tool for designers.},

The article explores the role of multimodal large models in image processing and OCR of ancient books. We discuss and exemplify how to use Large Language Models for intelligent information processing of ancient texts and explore combining prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), supervised fine-tuning, LangChain, and other techniques to improve performance in ancient text mining and applications. This article also looks forward to the broad prospect of intelligent agent technology combined with the Large Language Model in the innovative application of ancient book revitalization. The research focuses on digitizing ancient books, intelligent processing of ancient texts, and intelligent application of ancient book revitalization. It demonstrates the feasibility, advancement, and creativity of the application of generative AI and its derivative technologies in the field of computational humanities, especially in the field of ancient book preservation, to provide intelligent solutions for the dissemination of traditional thought and culture, from the perspective of the whole process of the technology of digital humanities and computational humanities research. The article also gives examples of the intelligent application of AI in the restoration of ancient books and the annotation of ancient texts. Although Large Language Models demonstrate transformative potential in advancing the field of ancient text research toward intelligent analysis, there remain certain limitations. This article points out their shortcomings in areas such as knowledge completion for ancient texts, understanding emotions and cultural nuances, as well as ethical and accountability issues. It emphasizes the need for a more balanced perspective on the role that generative AI plays in the exploration and utilization of cultural heritage.},

However, existing works focused on conventional machine-learning and pattern-based AI systems, and little is known about how researchers interact with GenAI in qualitative research. This work delves into researchers’ perceptions of their collaboration with GenAI, specifically ChatGPT. Through a user study involving ten qualitative researchers, we found ChatGPT to be a valuable collaborator for thematic analysis, enhancing coding efficiency, aiding initial data exploration, offering granular quantitative insights, and assisting comprehension for non-native speakers and non-experts. Yet, concerns about its trustworthiness and accuracy, reliability and consistency, limited contextual understanding, and broader acceptance within the research community persist. We contribute five actionable design recommendations to foster effective human-AI collaboration. These include incorporating transparent explanatory mechanisms, enhancing interface and integration capabilities, prioritising contextual understanding and customisation, embedding human-AI feedback loops and iterative functionality, and strengthening trust through validation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {When working with generative artificial intelligence (AI), users may see productivity gains, but content generated with the help of AI may not match their preferences exactly. The boost in productivity may come at the expense of users' idiosyncrasies, such as personal style and tastes, preferences we would naturally express without AI. To let users express their preferences, many AI systems let users edit their prompt (e.g., Midjourney) or allow more natural interactions (e.g., ChatGPT), and users can always review and edit the AI-generated output themselves. However, aligning a user's intentions with an AI's output can take time and may not always be worth it if the AI's first or default output "does the job." In short, users face a trade-off between AI output fidelity and communication cost. The purpose of this work is to examine the impact of this human-AI interaction on the AI-generated content we produce as a society.We propose a Bayesian model to study the societal consequences of human-AI interactions. For a given task, rational users can exchange information with the AI to align its output with their heterogeneous preferences. The AI has a knowledge of the distribution of preferences in the population and uses a Bayesian update to create the optimal output with maximal expected fidelity given the information shared by the user. Users choose the amount of information they share to maximize their utility, balancing the cost of communication with the fidelity of the output.We show that the interplay between individual users and AI may lead to societal challenges. Outputs may become more homogenized. The AI-generated output distribution has a lower variance than the users' preference distribution. And this phenomenon is exacerbated when AI-generated content is used to train the next generation of AI: we show numerically that the users' rational decisions and the AI's training process can mutually reinforce each other, leading to a homogenization "death spiral." We also study the effects of AI bias, identifying who benefits or loses when using an AI model that does not accurately reflect the population preference distribution. At the population level, the censoring type of bias (e.g., biasing against the more unique preferences) negatively impacts the population utility as a whole, especially users with uncommon preferences who rely on AI interactivity the most. On the other hand, directional biases (e.g., a slightly left-leaning AI) will influence the users' chosen output, leading to a societal bias. Nonetheless, our research also demonstrates that creating models that facilitate human-AI interactions can limit these risks and preserve the population preference diversity.A full version of this paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10448.},

This model extracts and fuses text features through attention mechanism, and achieves deep training of the neural network through skip links, making the neural network have better performance. The results showed that the performance of the TMMCJL model was outstanding, with the fastest convergence speed and the best convergence effect. In the experiment of processing 50 to 400 segments of text, the average accuracy of the TMMCJL was 86.5\%, and the F1 score reached 87.5, surpassing the accuracy of the BERT wwm model at 77.9\% and 76.2 F1 scores, as well as the Roberta model at 81.5\% and 85.6 F1 scores. These data clearly demonstrate the significant advantages of the TMMCJL model in terms of accuracy and F1 score. This model not only improves translation quality, but also has potential wide application value due to its stability in model training and practical application, providing a new direction for the future application of deep learning in the field of NLP.},

Based on our interviews, focus group discussions (FGD), and social media-based qualitative study, this paper reports how popular text-to-image GAI tools (ex., DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Firefly) are affecting various image-related local creative fields. We report how these tools limit the creative explorations of marginal artists, struggle to understand linguistic nuances, fail to generate local forms of art and architecture, and misrepresent the diversity among citizens in the image production process. Drawing from a rich body of work on critical image theory, postcolonial computing, and design politics, we explain how our findings are pertinent to HCI’s broader interest in social justice, decolonization, and global development.},

However, when such navigation aids are unavailable or not appropriately marked up, this situation can cause serious difficulties. This article presents the design and evaluation of a tool for automatically generating navigation aids with headers and internal links for screen readers with topicalisation and labelling algorithms. The proposed tool uses natural language processing techniques to divide a web document into topic segments and label each segment in two cycles based on its content. We conducted an initial user study in the first cycle with eight blind and partially-sighted screen reader users. The evaluation involved tasks with questions answered by participants with information from texts with and without automatically generated headers. The results in the first cycle provided preliminary indicators of performance improvement and cognitive load reduction. The second cycle involved co-designing an improved version with two blind experts in web accessibility, resulting in a browser extension which injects automatically generated headers and in-page navigation with internal links, along with improvements in the generation of labels using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The browser extension was evaluated by seven blind participants using the same four texts used to evaluate the preliminary prototype developed in the first cycle. With the two development cycles, the study provided important insights into the design of navigation aids for screen-reader users using natural language processing techniques, including the potential use of generative artificial intelligence for assistive technologies and limitations that need to be explored in future research.},

  abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has created a level of chaos in higher education as both students and faculty try to determine its utility and how best to incorporate it into the learning process. Students may view generative AI as a means to an end of achieving a perfect grade, skipping important elements of the learning process, or they may view it as an opportunity to expand their creative efforts. Faculty may view it as a tool students use to circumvent plagiarism detection, may feel it potentially minimizes the role of faculty in the classroom, or they may view it as an opportunity to avail of a supplement to existing activities and assignments. Ultimately, faculty are faced with maintaining academic integrity and reinforcing the need and importance of the learning process. This paper explores the combination of three approaches: peer-supported incremental learning, master/apprentice model, and growth mindset as a way for faculty to guide appropriate student use of generative AI, while also maintaining the integrity of the learning process.},

  abstract = {This research explores the application of ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence technology, in the field of education. ChatGPT, short for "generative pre-training," continuously evolves and adapts through user feedback, facilitating authentic human-machine interaction. It can process natural language input and generate relevant responses, thereby providing information and answering questions. The study highlights the potential of ChatGPT in university teacher education, where it can offer intelligent teaching assistance, personalized learning resources, and instructional support. However, the integration of ChatGPT also raises challenges, such as redefining the authority of knowledge and altering the dynamics of the teacher-student relationship. Some scholars contend that ChatGPT cannot replicate genuine emotions or free will, underscoring the irreplaceable nature of education. The transformative impact of ChatGPT on education demands a reevaluation of teachers' roles and professional development in the digital age. This study seeks to clarify the role of teachers within the digital transformation represented by ChatGPT and to explore strategies for successfully navigating this shift. Additionally, the research aims to assess teachers' perceptions and utilization of ChatGPT, address related challenges, and evaluate the feasibility, potential applications, and limitations of its integration into teaching.},

These tools, while impressive, are liable to reproduce, exacerbate, and reinforce extant human social biases, such as gender and racial biases. In this article, we systematically review the extent to which DALL-E Mini suffers from this problem. In line with the Model Card published alongside DALL-E Mini by its creators, we find that the images it produces tend to represent dozens of different occupations as populated either solely by men (e.g., pilot, builder, plumber) or solely by women (e.g., hairdresser, receptionist, dietitian). In addition, the images DALL-E Mini produces tend to represent most occupations as populated primarily or solely by White people (e.g., farmer, painter, prison officer, software engineer) and very few by non-White people (e.g., pastor, rapper). These findings suggest that exciting new AI technologies should be critically scrutinized and perhaps regulated before they are unleashed on society.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the main concerns of knowledge workers due to its ability to mimic realistic human reasoning and creativity. However, this integration raises critical concerns about trust and ethics, which are crucial in shaping both the acceptance and effective utilisation of these technologies. There are many reports, articles and papers currently exploring the opportunities and challenges of LLMs in higher education from the perspective of students and educators. However, these papers often focus on specific contexts like in the UK, US or a particular institutions. In this paper, we examine the problems of generative AI in higher education from educator and student perspectives using scientometrics and text analysis to provide an overview of the research landscape, followed by a narrative review and thematic analysis of selected literature. Some findings of this work are: (1) Students and educators found different ways to use generative AI. Students focus more on using it as an assistant (revising and preparing for lectures, helping with homework) and educators as a content production assistant (writing lecture notes, personalising content). Commonalities are that both students and educators use generative AI as an accessibility aid, e.g., to rephrase sentences or explain concepts. (2) The main concerns of higher education regarding generative AI are equity in access, clarity of rules regarding usage, and job displacement.},

This research uses Nanjing, a representative example of urban culture, as a backdrop to explore immersive visual image design and examine the impact of integrating technology and art on the cultural and creative industries. First, deep learning algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are employed to automatically analyze Nanjing's urban culture and extract visual elements, such as mountains, water, cities, and forests, with local characteristics. Next, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used to generate and optimize the extracted visual elements, organizing them in a systematic manner to enhance the artistic and scientific qualities of the images. Additionally, a highly interactive imaging system is designed by combining ToughDesigner (TD) software with Kinect sensing equipment. Finally, an immersive visual exhibition space is constructed using light and shadow projection technology to showcase Nanjing's urban culture and shape the city's image. This research aims to provide a reference for the future development of new media art, promote the deeper integration of technology and art, and enhance the public's cultural experience and perception of artworks.},

  abstract = {This study examined 120 Turkish stories written for primary, secondary, high school, and undergraduate education levels by ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini1.5 Pro. The data was processed by software created with Natural Language Processing methods in mind. The general characteristics, quantitative characteristics, and readability of the stories were all reviewed within the scope of the study. Using the Ate\c{s}man and Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formulas, which are widely used for Turkish texts, the readability of the stories was calculated. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that AI is able to produce distinct stories, and it generates cohesive stories by utilizing subjects and themes that are suitable for a specific educational audience. When the average readabilities are taken into account, it has been found that ChatGPT-3.5 generates better stories suited for the education level based on the Ate\c{s}man formula and Gemini based on the Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formula, and the difficulty level of ChatGPT-3.5 stories rises in tandem with education level in both formulas. Also, the stories at the undergraduate level were found to be the hardest to read and with primary schools having the easiest readability. When the number of stories at readability levels is taken into account, it has been found that GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 in the Ate\c{s}man formula and ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini in the Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formula generate appropriate stories for the education level; the levels range from easy to difficult as the education level increases. Additionally, it has been found that the number of stories included is gradually increasing. It was concluded that AIs produced stories above their educational level; while ChatGPT-3.5 and Gemini were more successful in story production, the Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formula was better in determining readability.},

In this paper, we posit that designing human-centered text-to-image AI tools requires a clear understanding of how individuals intuitively approach crafting prompts, and what challenges they may encounter. To address this, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 existing users of a text-to-image AI tool. Our findings (1) offer insights into users’ prompt journey including structures and processes for writing, evaluating, and refining prompts in text-to-image AI tools and (2) indicate that users must overcome barriers to aligning AI to their intents, and mastering prompt crafting knowledge. From the findings, we discuss the prompt journey as an individual yet a social experience and highlight opportunities for aligning text-to-image AI tools and users’ intents.},

We introduce IterClean, an iterative data cleaning framework leveraging large language models (LLMs). Utilizing an iterative mechanism, the framework employs a two-step process: data labeling and iterative data cleaning. With few labeled data, IterClean leverages an iterative cleaning process involving an error detector, an error verifier, and an error repairer to significantly enhance the cleaning performance. Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that, IterClean achieves an F1 score that is up to three times higher than the best state-of-the-art approaches requiring only 5 labeled tuples.},

The objective of JayBot is to provide information to users on general enquiries regarding course modules, duration, fees, entry requirements, lecturers, internship, career paths, course employability and other related aspects. Leveraging the use cases of generative artificial intelligence (AI), the chatbot application was built using OpenAI’s advanced large language model (GPT-3.5 turbo); to tackle issues such as hallucination as well as focus and timeliness of results, an embedding transformer model has been combined with a vector database and vector search. Prompt engineering techniques were employed to enhance the chatbot’s response abilities. Preliminary user studies indicate JayBot’s effectiveness and efficiency. The demo will showcase JayBot in a university admission use case and discuss further application scenarios.},

Large text-to-image models can quickly generate aesthetically pleasing outcomes. However, the process can be non-deterministic and often involves tedious trial-and-error as users struggle to formulate effective prompts to achieve their desired results. This paper describes a generative approach that empowers users to easily work with a large text-to-image (TTI) model to create their preferred painterly content. The authors propose a large model personalization method, namely Semantic Injection, to personalize a large TTI model in a given specific artistic style, i.e., Kandinsky’s paintings in Bauhaus era, as the Artist Model. Through working with a Kandinsky expert, the authors first establish a semantic descriptive guideline and a TTI dataset of Kandinsky style and then apply the Semantic Injection method to obtain an Artist Model of Kandinsky, empowering users to create preferred Kandinsky content in a deterministically controllable manner.},

Despite their similarities, the most effective representation methods for these steps differ, leading to inefficiencies, limited representativeness, and reduced interpretability.

The model is trained on generic paths sampled from the knowledge graph to capture foundational patterns, and then fine-tuned on paths specific of the downstream step (knowledge completion and path reasoning in our case).

This paper investigates faculty members' perceptions of using artificial intelligence, chatbots, and generative AI in teaching and learning in Uzbeki's higher education contexts. The researchers employed a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to collect the data. Purposeful sampling was employed to select participants in this study, and the interviews were conducted face-to-face at the university campus. The study's underlying theory is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, including effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, which were employed as a lens to direct the research. The data were transcribed and analyzed using the deductive approach for the thematic analysis. The findings revealed that lecturers have a positive attitude to adopt and use AI for content creation, assessment and feedback, and doing research in their institution. Some instructors may see it as a valuable tool for generating creative content and aiding student learning. In contrast, others may have concerns about its potential to replace human creativity or biases in generated materials. Lecturers also view AI as a technology to achieve accessibility and equity after overcoming the challenges. Findings revealed that some measurements should be taken about the facilitating conditions and the perceived risks of using AI.},

  abstract = {Addressing the performance and efficiency challenges of detecting small target defects on PCB (printed circuit board), this research proposes a lightweight inspection model for YOLOv8-based. The initial step involves employing an enhanced Efficient_Detect network architecture with the aim of diminishing the volume of model parameters and computational intricacy, while simultaneously augmenting resource utilization. Then, the deformable convolutional networks v2 (DCNv2) are integrated into the C2f structure to improve feature extraction for defects with diverse shapes on the PCB surface, enhancing the model's capability to identify different categories of flaws. Meanwhile, the Inner-SIoU loss function is utilized instead of the conventional CIoU loss function to enhance both the precision of inspection and the robustness of the model. The enhanced approach achieves an mAP50 of 96.8\% and an mAP50-95 of 72.2\%, marking an improvement of 3.9\% and 10.1\%, respectively, comparison with base YOLOv8n model. In addition, the parameter counts of the model, GFLOPs, and weight size are notably reduced by 18.4\%, 33.3\%, and 19.7\%, respectively, resulting in final metrics of 2.34 M, 5.4 GFLOPs, and a weight size of 4.9 M. In addition, the detection speed can reach up to 161 FPS, which has the potential for real-time detection. It provides an efficient and lightweight PCB small target defect detection solution for scenarios with limited computing resources.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has made unprecedented advances in vision language models over the past two years. These advances are largely due to diffusion-based generative models, which are very stable and simple to train. These diffusion models are tasked to learn the underlying unknown distribution of the training data samples. During the generative process, new samples (images) are generated from this unknown high-dimensional distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly effective in drawing samples from complex, high-dimensional distributions. This makes MCMC methods an integral component for both the training and sampling phases of these models, ensuring accurate sample generation.Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques.A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples (images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge, linking these closely related areas of research. Our tutorial aims to provide necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

  abstract = {Offline reinforcement learning aims to empower agents to derive effective strategies from a pre-existing dataset for decision-making tasks. This learning paradigm has a broad application prospect in areas with high safety constraints, such as healthcare and robotic control. However, existing offline reinforcement learning algorithms often overlook the impact of the dataset's inherent multimodal distribution on policy optimization during the training phase, leading to compromised model performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel offline reinforcement learning algorithm based on mixture density policy network, MDPo ( Mixture Density Policy). The MDPo algorithm initially employs an expected regression loss function to train the value function. Subsequently, it constructs the policy using a mixture density network and trains the policy through a distributional constraint, ultimately learning a high-quality policy model under the combined influence of the reward signal and policy constraints. Predominantly leveraging mixture density networks, MDPo models the policy as a multimodal distribution, enhancing the policy's representational capacity to better fit the multimodal distribution of actions in the dataset, thereby increasing training process stability and improving model performance. Experiments conducted on the Antmaze task of the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that MDPo significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, also demonstrating the enhancement of training stability.},

  abstract = {The surge in access to and awareness of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) such as ChatGPT has sparked discussion over the necessary technological literacies and competencies needed to effectively engage with these systems. In this context, we explore AI as a tool that mediates cultural understanding and remediates human values – that are often influenced by biases and inequities. Using participatory design for learning with a group of 13 children (ages 8-13), we engaged in five co-design sessions featuring different modalities for socio-cultural approaches to AI literacy. We found that children were more aware of the cultural mediation aspect of AI when the content of the interaction aligned with their cultural background and context. This underscored the significance of aligning the representation of culture in these GenAI systems with people’s socio-cultural ecosystems in modern technological literacies. We conclude with design principles for a more critical and holistic approach to AI literacy.},

  abstract = {The launch of the generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) application ChatGPT by OpenAI launched artificial intelligence into public discourse and led to a wave of mass uptake of this technology in organizations in the private sector. At the same time, AI is increasingly incorporated into government functions and the public sector. We propose that governments and the public sector can set an example for the responsible use of AI technologies by following the principles of algorithmic governance traditionally recommended to the private sector. Algorithmic governance has traditionally been defined in the literature as governance by algorithms, or how artificial intelligence is used to make governance decisions and affect social ordering. However, we take an alternative approach; instead, we conceptualize algorithmic governance as the governance of algorithms. We begin by summarizing the risks of generative AI use in government, then outline algorithmic governance principles, a step-by-step approach to implementing algorithmic governance into government or public sector projects, opportunities for inter-sector collaboration, and final conclusions.},

  abstract = {Engineering process management aims to formally specify processes which are executable, measurable, and controllable. Common representations include text-based domain-specific languages (DSLs) or graphical notations such as the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN). The specification itself can be seen as a Software Product Line (SPL), building upon concepts such as tasks, UI forms, fields and actions. Domain experts provide requirements for processes but often lack the technical programming skills to formalize them in a process specification language. We present an interactive SPL application prototype that allows domain experts to model simple processes in natural language. Our framework for the reliable generation of formal specifications with Large Language Models (LLMs) supports the machine-translation from natural language to a JSON-based process DSL. In this case study, five domain experts were asked to model any process of their choice through natural-language interactions. As a result, the user interface corresponding to the process DSL was shown as immediate feedback. We documented their perceived translation quality and interviewed them on their impressions of this methodology. An average user-assessed performance rating of 68\% was achieved. Even though the modelling strategies differed greatly between individuals, the tool was able to adequately capture the majority of instructions, leaving an overall positive impression on the participants. More context awareness and additional conventional interaction elements were the main aspects found to be improved for a productive implementation.},

However, multimodal feedback-integrating textual, auditory, and visual cues-promises a more engaging and effective learning experience. By leveraging multiple sensory channels, multimodal feedback better accommodates diverse learning preferences and aids in deeper information retention. Despite its potential, creating multimodal feedback poses challenges, including the need for increased time and resources. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offer solutions to automate the feedback process, predominantly focusing on textual feedback. Yet, the application of GenAI in generating multimodal feedback remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates the use of GenAI techniques to generate multimodal feedback, aiming to provide this feedback for large cohorts of learners, thereby enhancing learning experience and engagement. By exploring the potential of GenAI for this purpose, we propose a framework for automating the generation of multimodal feedback, which we name MuFIN.},

By simplifying the quantification process of risk factors for transportation vehicles passing through densely populated areas, with the goal of minimizing the number of vehicles, the total transportation distance, and the shortest driving distance through densely populated areas, an optimization model for the transportation path problem of hazardous goods vehicles is established. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on probability model is designed for the model. Taking a hazardous material transportation network with 5 transportation vehicles, 24 demand nodes, and 6 densely populated areas as an example, validate the model and algorithm. The example results show that the Pareto solution of the vehicle routing problem can be obtained using this algorithm, providing decision support for the scheduling of hazardous goods transportation vehicles.},

To address this issue, we propose a meta-learning method that integrates multilingual knowledge, which mainly includes two modules: the multilingual knowledge obtain module, which alleviates data scarcity by introducing multilingual knowledge from outside; The meta-learning module utilizes ProtoMAML combined with l₂ standardization to extract language independent causal features from text and learn better event representations in different languages. The experimental results on the latest publicly available MECI dataset show that our model outperforms the current best baseline, with an average F1 improvement of 3.9\% in different languages.},

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in multilingual translation tasks involving Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Chinese. Compared to traditional multilingual baseline models, this method achieves a significant improvement with an average BLEU score increase of up to 1.34 in many-to-one translation scenarios and 0.7 in one-to-many translation scenarios.

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the multimodal transportation path optimization problem for consumer electronics products under the condition of transport time uncertainty. Approaching the problem from the perspective of multimodal transport operators within a defined network, the study integrates the stochastic travel time, stochastic transfer time, customer demands for timely delivery and the complexity of multiple orders. Combining with the high-value time-sensitive characteristics of consumer electronic products and taking the minimum of total cost as the optimization objective, we establish a multimodal transport path optimization model. In order to solve this model, a genetic algorithm with elite strategy based on Monte Carlo sampling is designed. Finally, we verify the validity of the model and algorithm through a specific case. And the case results are analyzed. The case results indicate that for the long-distance transportation of goods such as consumer electronics, which have a very high time-value cost, it is more appropriate to choose a multimodal transportation scheme based on road and railroad transportation, while waterway transportation does not have an advantage. In addition, further consideration of the uncertainty of the transportation time results in a transportation solution that ensures a higher probability of on-time delivery, while the total cost increases slightly but the transportation time decreases. The transportation scheme is more stable. The results of this paper provide a reference basis for the actual multimodal transportation path optimization problem of consumer electronics.},

  abstract = {Pedestrian detection is commonly studied using visible light (RGB) images. However, in environments with poor lighting or occlusions, the performance of object detection using RGB images tends to be subpar. In contrast, infrared (IR) images yield better results in such special circumstances. Therefore, multispectral image fusion for pedestrian detection is increasingly being adopted. While this feature interaction and fusion approach enhances features, it can also introduce background noise, preventing the model from focusing on pedestrians. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight network with Unet and attention mechanism (UANet). UANet enhances the accuracy of pedestrian detection under varying illuminance by combining the strengths of RGB-IR image pairs. In UANet, a UNet-based module is designed for extracting and reusing multi-scale features from RGB images. To further extract high-level features, we incorporate a fully connected module into the UNet-based module. For infrared images, we employ high-frequency attention and average attention to extract target features from infrared images and fuse them with RGB features. In experiments, we validate the effectiveness of UANet in improving pedestrian detection performance. We conducted tests on the KAIST dataset, yielding a result of 95.23\% mAP and 7.65\% MR.},

We applied a convergent mixed-methods approach to offer a comprehensive understanding of AI adoption dynamics. We initially conducted a questionnaire survey with 100 software engineers, drawing upon the Technology Acceptance Model, the Diffusion of Innovation Theory, and the Social Cognitive Theory as guiding theoretical frameworks. Employing the Gioia methodology, we derived a theoretical model of AI adoption in software engineering: the Human-AI Collaboration and Adaptation Framework. This model was then validated using Partial Least Squares–Structural Equation Modeling based on data from 183 software engineers. Findings indicate that at this early stage of AI integration, the compatibility of AI tools within existing development workflows predominantly drives their adoption, challenging conventional technology acceptance theories. The impact of perceived usefulness, social factors, and personal innovativeness seems less pronounced than expected. The study provides crucial insights for future AI tool design and offers a framework for developing effective organizational implementation strategies.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been significant progress in the quality of neural machine translation technology, largely attributed to the abundance of high-quality bilingual parallel sentences. However, low-resource languages face a challenge as the availability of bilingual parallel corpora is limited, leading to subpar translation performance. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a data augmentation approach based on semantic word replacement specifically designed for neural machine translation of low-resource languages. The method comprises two key steps: firstly, expanding the corpus of low-resource languages through semantic word replacement techniques; secondly, utilizing a neural grammar correction model to proofread the augmented bilingual parallel corpora. Subsequently, these corrected corpora are merged with the original corpus to mitigate the data scarcity for low-resource languages. Experimental evaluations were conducted on various low-resource language pairs (including Mongolian-Chinese, Tibetan-Chinese, Uyghur-Chinese, Arabic-Chinese) as well as English-German and German-English translation tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the translation quality of low-resource languages, achieving a maximum BLEU score improvement of up to 3.06 compared to the baseline system, underscoring the efficacy of the approach.},

However, adapting the upstream large-scale pre-training model to downstream tasks with specific requirements, such as building extraction, often encounters significant challenges due to the complex spatial relationships present in remote sensing images. To address this issue, we proposed a novel building extraction network named Natural Language Guided Building Extraction with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (NLG-ExtractClip) to use natural language to guide building extraction. Specifically, we introduce a Natural Language Guiding Module (NLGM) to generate remote sensing image captions with rich spatial information, and then use CLIP Text Encoder to generate Guiding Text Embeddings. We use a Multimodal Fusion Attention Module (MFAM) to combine textual information with the visual features of remote sensing images to adapt to building extraction specific tasks. Our experiments on two building extraction datasets show that our proposed method performs better than other compared methods.},

In this paper, the influence of the structure size, circuit connection mode and fixing mode of the 0kHz-35kHz receiving transducer on the performance of the receiving transducer is numerically simulated. It is concluded that shorter and thicker piezoelectric patches can effectively improve the receiving sensitivity, bandwidth and stability of the receiving transducer. The series circuit connection mode has good reception sensitivity stationarity, and the reception sensitivity stationarity is improved by 23.8dB, but its reception sensitivity stationarity is extremely poor. The fixed boundary condition at both ends can obviously broaden the receiving bandwidth of impulse sound source receiver and transducer, but the receiving sensitivity of fixed boundary condition at both ends is smaller than that of free boundary condition and free boundary condition at one end. This conclusion has theoretical reference significance for the manufacture of impulse sound source receiving transducer.},

In this paper, we analyze capabilities and limitations of incorporating such models in conversational interfaces for the telecommunication domain, specifically for enterprise wireless products and services. Using Cradlepoint’s publicly available data for our experiments, we present a comparative analysis of the responses from such models for multiple use-cases including domain adaptation for terminology and product taxonomy, context continuity, robustness to input perturbations and errors. We believe this evaluation would provide useful insights to data scientists engaged in building customized conversational interfaces for domain-specific requirements.},

  abstract = {Synchronized acoustic-articulatory data is the basis of various applications, such as exploring the fundamental mechanisms of speech production, acoustic to articulatory inversion (AAI), articulatory to acoustic mapping, etc. Most of the studies in these fields directly trained various models with EMA-synchronized speech, while the target inputs or outputs are stand-alone speech in real applications. However, the recording conditions of EMA-synchronized speech and stand-alone speech are different, which may make the EMA-synchronized speech different to the stand-alone speech and degrade the performance of downstream tasks. Hence, it is necessary to shed light on whether the EMA-synchronized speech and stand-alone speech signals are different, and if so, how this affects the performance of the models trained with synchronized acoustic-articulatory data. In this study, we explore differences between EMA-synchronized speech and stand-alone speech from the aspect of speech recognition, and its influence on the performance of AAI. The results indicate the performance of phone error rate increases from 7.8\% for stand-alone speech to 37.4\% for EMA-synchronized speech, and the RMSE increases from 0.71mm for EMA- synchronized speech to 3.07mm when the input is switched from EMA-synchronized speech to stand-alone speech for the AAI model trained with EMA-synchronized speech.},

  abstract = {In the digital era, the rapid development of e-commerce logistics networks is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency, especially under emergency conditions such as epidemics and earthquakes. This study introduces a novel framework for optimizing e-commerce logistics by integrating AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with Back Propagation (BP) neural networks, further refined through Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization. Utilizing cargo volume data over a two-year period, we developed a sophisticated ARIMA-BP model to forecast the daily cargo volume for each route for the subsequent month. The subsequent application of a GA-optimized BP neural network aims to achieve a multi-objective optimization, focusing on minimizing the impact of route disruptions and balancing workload distribution across the network. We employed network centrality measures—degree, closeness, and betweenness—to evaluate the significance of logistics sites and routes, enhancing the network's resilience and operational efficiency. This approach also facilitated the integration of new logistics sites and routes, bolstering network performance. Further, we introduced a stochastic perturbation technique to explore the network's adaptability to both anticipated and unforeseen flow changes post-route closure. Finally, complex network topology analysis was applied to assess the robustness of the logistics network. Our methodology exemplifies a comprehensive strategy for e-commerce logistics optimization, offering a robust framework for enhancing network resilience and efficiency in face of emergencies, thereby contributing to the reduction of operational costs and improvement of service quality.},

This new approach significantly enhances efficiency but also presents challenges in unsupervised code construction with limited security guarantees. LLMs excel in producing code with accurate grammar, yet they are not specifically trained to guarantee the security of the code. In this paper, we provide an initial exploration into using formal software specifications as a starting point for software construction, allowing developers to translate descriptions of security-related behavior into natural language instructions for LLMs, a.k.a., prompts. In addition, we leveraged automated verification tools to evaluate the code produced against the aforementioned specifications , following a modular, step-by-step software construction process. For our study, we leveraged Role-based Access Control (RBAC), a mature security model, and the Java Modeling Language (JML), a behavioral specification language for Java. We test our approach on different publicly-available LLMs, namely, OpenAI ChatGPT 4.0, Google Bard, and Microsoft CoPilot. We provide a description of two applications-a security-sensitive Banking application employing RBAC and an RBAC API module itself-, the corresponding JML specifications, as well as a description of the prompts, the generated code, the verification results, as well as a series of interesting insights for practitioners interested in further exploring the use of LLMs for securely constructing applications.},

  abstract = {Generative AI has made impressive strides in enabling users to create diverse and realistic visual content such as images, videos, and audio. However, training generative models on large centralized datasets can pose challenges in terms of data privacy, security, and accessibility. Federated learning (FL) is an approach that uses decentralized techniques to collaboratively train a shared deep learning model while retaining the training data on individual edge devices to preserve data privacy. This paper proposes a novel method for training a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) across multiple data sources using FL techniques. Diffusion models, a newly emerging generative model, show promising results in achieving superior quality images than Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our proposed method Phoenix is an unconditional diffusion model that leverages strategies to improve the data diversity of generated samples even when trained on data with statistical heterogeneity or Non-IID (Non-Independent and Identically Distributed) data. We demonstrate how our approach outperforms the default diffusion model in a FL setting. These results indicate that high-quality samples can be generated by maintaining data diversity, preserving privacy, and reducing communication between data sources, offering exciting new possibilities in the field of generative AI.},

Using a comparative research methodology, the study analyzed the most recent policy documents from these regions through text-mining techniques to assess their key differences in terms of word frequency and specific content. This work highlights the different strategies, goals, and approaches to regulating generative AI across the regions. It found that the EU adopts a more comprehensive and stringent regulation of generative AI, emphasizing regional harmonization and foresight; the U.S. regulation is characterized by pragmatism, closely aligned with industry innovation, and a focus on risk avoidance; while China focuses more on macro-level regulation aimed at promoting innovation and encouraging ecological construction.Participants may be interested in this study because it not only uses up-to-date materials but also employs text-mining methods to present the findings in a clearer way than previous studies. It provides insights into how regulatory policies for generative AI affect the development and practice of digital government. The study sheds light on different countries’ strategies for technology governance, which is crucial for understanding and designing effective digital government policies. In addition, due to the potential of generative AI technologies to deliver public services and drive government transparency, these insights help participants better assess the opportunities and challenges of technological innovation in the digital government space.},

  abstract = {In order to solve the reliability problem of requirement identification at the early stage of the product, a requirement prioritization analysis method based on online review data and entropy weight TOPSIS is proposed for product requirement mining and requirement analysis. Firstly, online review data of the product is collected by web scraper software, then text processing and LDA topic clustering are carried out to identify user requirements; secondly, after considering various factors to formulate suitable design objectives, entropy weight TOPSIS method is used to carry out priority analysis of requirements under multiple objectives; finally, the reliability analysis process of product requirements is completed taking rowing machine as an example. The study demonstrates that requirement prioritization analysis in the initial stages of product development, while considering multi-objective factors, improves subsequent product analysis and design by facilitating a more focused and effective approach.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) represents a crucial subset of AI models characterized by their ability to generate new content based on user input, showing vast potential to transform learning and teaching. However, educators have raised ethical concerns, particularly regarding the adverse effect on students' learning if students simply parrot generative AI-generated content without engaging in critical analysis or original thought. Moreover, there exists the potential of generative AI to perpetuate existing biases in training data. This editorial discusses three major concerns in generative AI use in education and proposes questions (on task-AI fit and people-AI fit) and approaches to address the ethical considerations by adopting five principles of AI ethics. The editorial also discusses developing a classroom AI use policy as one governance mechanism for promoting ethical use of AI. As generative AI technology continues to evolve, so must our educational practices. The editorial ends with a call for readers (educators) to collaboratively define the terms of engagement with generative AI in educational settings and to begin this discourse by sharing insights and experiences with promoting ethical use of generative AI.},

  abstract = {Stable Diffusion has recently emerged as a groundbreaking technique in the field of generative artificial intelligence. By utilizing concise text prompts, Stable Diffusion is capable of producing images that are either strikingly realistic or visually stunning, bridging the gap between textual descriptions and visual representations. A notable challenge associated with Stable Diffusion is the retrieval of corresponding prompts from generated images. To tackle this challenge, we employed a strategy that leverages the capabilities of the ConvNeXt model within the OpenCLIP framework. Having trained the model on an extensive dataset of nearly 2.1 million Stable Diffusion generated images, we then subjected our approach to the evaluation of the Kaggle Stable Diffusion - Image to Prompts competition. The effectiveness of our methodology is underscored by a mean cosine similarity score of 0.63032 between the predicted and actual prompt embedding vectors on the private test set, securing a silver medal position. This achievement not only attests to the robustness of our approach but also signifies its potential in diverse sectors where the retrieval of text from images is of great importance.},

Large language models have opened up new horizons for generating content tuned to one’s interests, yet it is unclear in what ways and to what extent this customization could have positive effects on learning. To explore this novel dimension, we conducted a between-subjects online study (n=272) featuring different variations of a generative AI vocabulary learning app that enables users to personalize their learning examples. Participants were randomly assigned to control (sentence sourced from pre-existing text) or experimental conditions (generated sentence or short story based on users’ text input). While we did not observe a difference in learning performance between the conditions, the analysis revealed that generative AI-driven context personalization positively affected learning motivation. We discuss how these results relate to previous findings and underscore their significance for the emerging field of using generative AI for personalized&nbsp;learning.},

We propose a framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate contextual, useful, answerable, fluent and diverse questions about products, via in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Recommending these questions to customers as helpful suggestions or hints to both start and continue a conversation can result in a smoother and faster shopping experience with reduced conversation overhead and friction. We perform extensive offline evaluations, and discuss in detail about potential customer impact, and the type, length and latency of our generated product questions if incorporated into a real-world shopping assistant.},

Through natural language processing (NLP) and content analysis, we observe an increasingly negative sentiment in the discussion and identify six main categories of student and faculty experiences of GenAI in education. These experiences reflect concerns about academic integrity and AI’s negative impact on the values of traditional education. Our analysis also highlights the tension and burden imposed by new technologies. Our findings suggest that dialogue between stakeholders in the education community is critical and can mitigate sources of tension between students and faculty.},

  abstract = {In practical application environments, the task of piano music transcription confronts a series of challenges including the long-tail distribution characteristics of training data, inadequate transcription accuracy in multi-key scenarios, interference from environmental noise, and the inability of mobile devices to meet the demands of real-time transcription. This study builds upon the Onsets and Frames model and introduces a series of structural improvements aimed at enhancing model performance. These include the simplification and optimization of the model structure, the introduction of data augmentation strategies, and the refinement of the loss function. Precise quantization of the model, coupled with effective mobile deployment strategies, ensures the efficient operation of the model on mobile devices. Experimental validation in the mobile environment demonstrates that the proposed improvements significantly enhance transcription accuracy in various scenarios, achieving a 56.98\% increase in transcription speed compared to the original model, thereby meeting the requirements for real-time transcription. Moreover, the new model exhibits substantial noise resistance capabilities, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions where the performance degradation is considerably less than that of the original model.},

  abstract = {Automatic melanoma detection from dermoscopic skin samples is one of the most challenging tasks in medical image analysis. Deep Convolutional Networks (DCN) have emerged as practical tools in addressing these challenges, particularly in skin cancer diagnosis. The research aims to explore the performance of various neural networks in skin cancer recognition, assessing metrics such as accuracy (ACC), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The study uses modified DCN classifiers, namely ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121, on the HAM10000 dataset. The results demonstrate that the modified InceptionV3 exhibited high performance compared to other networks, achieving a weighted accuracy of 86.58\% and a weighted ROC of 0.96. This model's advantage lies in its efficient feature extraction capability and acceptable inference time per epoch. The study concludes that DCN provides a reliable framework for automating melanoma diagnosis and expediting identification, potentially saving lives. The paper also delves into the dataset preprocessing, model optimization strategies, and detailed performance analysis of the modified models. Key findings include the superior performance of the modified InceptionV3 in skin cancer classification and its potential to enhance early skin cancer detection, aligning with developing an efficient melanoma detection method.},

At the same time, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a very successful paradigm for a variety of machine learning tasks. In this survey, we discuss the state of the art, opportunities and open research questions in applying RL to generative AI. In particular, we will discuss three types of applications, namely, RL as an alternative way for generation without specified objectives; as a way for generating outputs while concurrently maximizing an objective function; and, finally, as a way of embedding desired characteristics, which cannot be easily captured by means of an objective function, into the generative process. We conclude the survey with an in-depth discussion of the opportunities and challenges in this fascinating emerging area.},

  abstract = {The traditional evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems is generally very costly as it requires manual relevance annotation from human experts. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence -specifically large language models (LLMs)- can generate relevance annotations at an enormous scale with relatively small computational costs. Potentially, this could alleviate the costs traditionally associated with IR evaluation and make it applicable to numerous low-resource applications. However, generated relevance annotations are not immune to (systematic) errors, and as a result, directly using them for evaluation produces unreliable results.In this work, we propose two methods based on prediction-powered inference and conformal risk control that utilize computer-generated relevance annotations to place reliable confidence intervals (CIs) around IR evaluation metrics. Our proposed methods require a small number of reliable annotations from which the methods can statistically analyze the errors in the generated annotations. Using this information, we can place CIs around evaluation metrics with strong theoretical guarantees. Unlike existing approaches, our conformal risk control method is specifically designed for ranking metrics and can vary its CIs per query and document. Our experimental results show that our CIs accurately capture both the variance and bias in evaluation based on LLM annotations, better than the typical empirical bootstrapping estimates. We hope our contributions bring reliable evaluation to the many IR applications where this was traditionally infeasible.},

In order to reduce China's dependence on traditional mineral energy, some achievements have been made in increasing research and development efforts in new energy. With the continuous increase in the scale of new energy grid connection, the proportion of new energy grid connection is constantly increasing, and problems such as grid stability and power quality degradation are becoming increasingly prominent, which directly affects the widespread application of new energy generation technology. This article explored the research on a remote control system for new energy grid connected power generation based on artificial intelligence. Taking the island detection of photovoltaic grid connected inverters based on Adaboost algorithm as an example, the feasibility of the technology was verified through experiments. The experimental data showed that the accuracy, recall, and F0.5 of island effect prediction based on Adaboost algorithm were 0.98, 0.9523, and 0.7811, respectively, which were higher than other algorithms.},

Users can now express not only their queries and questions, but actual information needs, tasks, and goals in natural language to an AI system and receive not just results, but also answers in natural language that are generated specifically for them.

Qinghai Oilfield has accumulated a large amount of reservoir dynamic analysis data in long-term exploration and development, but the comprehensive use of data and intelligent application is not deep enough, which seriously affects the efficiency of reservoir dynamic analysis. In order to improve the efficiency of reservoir dynamics analysis and decision-making, an intelligent reservoir dynamics analysis platform based on a cloud platform and artificial intelligence analysis methods was established in Qinghai Oilfield. The intelligent reservoir dynamic analysis platform integrates heterogeneous data from multiple sources, establishes scenario-based reservoir dynamic analysis topics, forms a four-level dynamic analysis structure of well-well group-layer-reservoir, and implements functions such as reservoir evaluation indicators calculation, reservoir dynamic early warning analysis, reservoir development parameters optimization, and reservoir development evaluation. Based on this platform, Qinghai Oilfield has achieved the intelligent practice of reservoir dynamic analysis with integrated geological engineering technology. Through the intelligent practice of reservoir dynamic analysis, Qinghai Oilfield has greatly improved the efficiency of reservoir development and production, and the digital and intelligent development has been promoted.},

  abstract = {The Putian dialect is an ancient language with a rich historical and cultural background. Currently, there is a lack of published research on automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology for the Putian dialect due to various reasons. One notable example is the absence of an audio corpus specifically for this dialect. Moreover, the pronunciation of Putian dialect significantly differs from that of Mandarin used in our daily lives. This paper aims to address these challenges by collecting 8000 isolated words from a phonetic corpus dedicated to the Putian dialect. Based on this self-built database, I attempt to achieve speech recognition for the Putian dialect using various models such as single phoneme model recognition, three-phoneme model, linear discriminant analysis, maximum likelihood change, speaker adaptive training, quick model and DNN-HMM model. Notably, the DNN-HMM-2 model yields the best results with a word error rate of 20.56\%. In this experiment, I introduce an additional layer of mapping in order to construct a two-step mapping method for phoneme - Putian dialect - Mandarin alignment. This approach improves training alignment accuracy and reduces character error rate by approximately 3\% compared to using only one-level mapping.},

  abstract = {The co-occurring sector trends in the stock market reveal interdependencies among certain industry sectors. This study proposes a novel approach to construct index features by leveraging this correlation phenomenon to forecast the future trends of sector indices. By computing the correlation coefficients between sector indices, sectors with strong positive correlations with a specific sector are identified. The historical trends of these strongly correlated sectors are extracted, and a joint forecasting model based on Long Short-term Memory Networks (LSTM) is established. Multi-dimensional time-series features are extracted to predict the future trend changes of specific sector indices. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves effective results in predicting the trends of some industry sectors, obtaining weighted F1 score greater than 0.75 for multiple industry sectors such as Automotive Services and Energy Metals. The findings of this study suggest that leveraging industry sector correlations can enhance the accuracy and reliability of index trend forecasting, albeit with attention required to market risks and model errors in practical applications. This research provides insights and guidance for stock market trend forecasting studies.},

  abstract = {In response to the problem of complex visual feature categories and sparse datasets for related refined categories in traffic accidents, this article has created a traffic accident target detection dataset, the AccOD dataset, which is divided into five categories. This dataset can serve as a benchmark for training and evaluating traffic accident target detection algorithms. Aiming at the real-time, accuracy, and intelligence issues of traffic accident detection, an improved traffic accident target detection network based on YOLOv8 is proposed. This network replaces a more efficient backbone network structure and improves the downsampling module that integrates different scale features in the head network, reducing the number of model parameters and computational complexity while improving the detection accuracy of the model. The C2f module is improved to balance various contextual information, further enhancing the detection ability of the model. The experiment showed that the improved model achieved a 4.75\% improvement in mAP0.5 and 4.58\% improvement in mAP0.5:0.95 on the AccOD dataset compared to YOLOv8n, and a 2.14\% improvement in mAP0.5 and 6.23\% improvement in mAP0.5:0.95 on the open source ACD dataset. This algorithm improves the detection accuracy of traffic accidents and maintains the lightweight of the model, providing an effective method for intelligent traffic accident detection.},

  abstract = {In addressing the limited receptive field of single-layer convolution in EEG emotion recognition, the need to stack multiple layers of convolution for expanding the receptive field poses challenges of increased parameter size and training cost. Simultaneously, there is an oversight of channel information in EEG emotion recognition. To tackle these issues, this paper introduces a multi-feature EEG emotion recognition model based on 1D-Inception (1D-Inception-Channel-Spatial-LSTM Network, DCSL). DCSL integrates channel information, spatial features, and temporal dependencies, resulting in more effective EEG emotion recognition. The Inception structure is enhanced to fit EEG signals, enabling multi-scale convolution. The Channel Attention Module is introduced to learn the weights of different channels, enhancing emotion recognition performance. Additionally, a Spatial Attention mechanism is incorporated to further extract spatial features from EEG signals. To better capture the temporal dependencies in EEG signals, an LSTM module is introduced at the end of the model. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the DCSL network in EEG emotion recognition tasks.},

However, current music recommendation methods are mainly recommended through collaborative filtering, content-based, and manual rule methods, and cannot be recommended based on the user's real-time status, resulting in the recommended music does not meet the real-time needs of users. In response to this situation, this paper proposes a personalized music recommendation model based on human physiological signals. This model first analyzes the user's physiological data, such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, etc., and uses a graph convolutional neural network algorithm to perceive the user's real-time emotional state. It then achieves more accuracy and personalization music recommendations based on the relationship model between emotion and music selection. This research not only expands the research scope in the field of music recommendation, but also provides new ideas and methods for the further development of intelligent music recommendation systems.},

In many network texts, sentiment analysis of each entity has always been an important issue. The traditional Bi-LSTM model has the problem of gradient explosion or excessive correction in the learning rate, which affects the convergence speed and stability of the model. In this paper, a Bi-LSTM optimization model combining progressive preheating and cosine annealing is proposed, which uses word embedding technology, word shape reduction technology and named entity recognition technology. Experiments show that our model can achieve high accuracy on both the training set and the verification set, and the loss is gradually reduced.

Through in-depth comparative analysis, the model shows obvious advantages in key performance indicators such as accuracy, recall rate and F1 value.},

This step is not commonly found in prior research.Firstly, a random forest model is established with “whether AI assistance was used to complete the paper” as the output, and various features as inputs. The analysis of the predictive accuracy when changing input features reveals the degree of influence of each feature on using AI to complete the paper. After feature selection, the remaining 6 features can still effectively predict the use of AI to complete the paper, indicating the representativeness of the extracted indicators. Subsequently, the PCA-K-means algorithm is employed to classify the use of artificial intelligence. PCA algorithm is used for dimensionality reduction of the extracted features to better characterize students’ use of AI. Three representative variables are selected, and the contribution of each feature is computed based on the factor loading matrix. Finally, the K-means algorithm is used to classify students based on the three-dimensional features, showing that students can be effectively classified into 2 categories. The results indicate that the majority of students support the use of AI technology to enhance their abilities, although some students may only intend to use AI to cope with exams and similar tasks.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, the cultural industry supply chain industry is ushering in a revolutionary change. In this paper, we will explore the application areas of AI in cultural industry supply chain management, analyse the benefits and challenges it brings, and look forward to the future development trend of the integration of AI and supply chain. Traditional supply chain management methods often require a large amount of manpower to manage and monitor due to the lack of intelligence and automation. This not only increases the operating costs for the development of cultural and creative industries, but also may adversely affect the development of cultural industries due to poor information transmission and errors caused by human factors. With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, these problems are gradually being solved. Through the application of artificial intelligence technology, the intelligence and automation of supply chain management can be realised, and the reliance on human resources can be reduced. The application of artificial intelligence technology in supply chain management has great potential. It can effectively solve the problems of traditional management methods and improve the competitiveness and operational efficiency of cultural industry development. Therefore, more and more cultural industries have begun to pay attention to and try to apply AI to supply chain management in order to achieve more efficient and smarter operations.},

The implementation of AI ethics is still, in many ways, a work in progress, but various initiatives are tackling the issues by creating guidelines and implementation methods. This study investigates concerns about the negative impacts of AI systems posed by researchers working with AI. The study was conducted as a scenario-based survey, in which participants answered the question, "What could go wrong?" regarding five scenarios depicting fictional AI systems. The study concludes with the results from 33 survey participants who gave 161 responses to the scenarios. The results suggest that researchers can identify threats posed by AI systems, particularly regarding their social and ethical consequences. This is even though half of the participants reported limited involvement with AI ethics in their work. The widespread understanding of ethics among researchers could positively impact AI software development due to increased capabilities to bring theoretical AI ethics to practice.},

This work in progress considers the application of large language models for content generation tailored to mastery learning. We present a paired framework for analyzing and evaluating the generated content relative to rubrics designed by the teacher. Recognizing the potential of large language models, we critically assess the potential of improving mastery-based instruction.

With AIGC, it can be effortless to generate high-quality data that is challenging for the public to distinguish. Nevertheless, the proliferation of generative data across cyberspace brings security and privacy issues, including privacy leakages of individuals and media forgery for fraudulent purposes. Consequently, both academia and industry begin to emphasize the trustworthiness of generative data, successively providing a series of countermeasures for security and privacy. In this survey, we systematically review the security and privacy on generative data in AIGC, particularly for the first time analyzing them from the perspective of information security properties. Specifically, we reveal the successful experiences of state-of-the-art countermeasures in terms of the foundational properties of privacy, controllability, authenticity, and compliance, respectively. Finally, we show some representative benchmarks, present a statistical analysis, and summarize the potential exploration directions from each of these properties.},

  abstract = {Crowd counting in dense scenes is a crucial task in the field of computer vision that aims to estimate crowd statistics by predicting the location of heads. However, the accuracy of detection algorithms usually depends on manual precision labeling of a vast amount of data, which is less feasible in practical scene applications due to its high labeling cost. Moreover, the manual labeling process is prone to errors such as false labeling and missing labeling due to overlapping and small targets in the image. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a pseudo label generation algorithm based on semi-supervised learning for dense crowd datasets. The proposed algorithm employs the self-training method of target detection in semi-supervised learning to generate pseudo-labels offline. Furthermore, the algorithm uses existing point labels in dense crowd datasets to correct the positioning information, which significantly reduces the high labeling cost. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on three widely used benchmarks, ShanghaiTech, NWPU-Crowd, and UCF-QNRF, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

The attention mechanism combines channel attention and spatial attention, which helps to the proposed model effectively select sample points with high signal-to-noise ratio in the traces and assign weights, and then the feature extraction ability of the proposed model is improved. Furthermore, the densely connected convolutional network makes the enhanced features clearer and transmission of gradients more effective through dense connections, which would improve the training effect of the model. The tested results on four public data sets of the AES algorithm show that, compared with the existing deep learning side-channel attack models, the attention mechanism can effectively improve the feature extraction ability of the proposed model, so that the model have more adaptable to different datasets, then the number of traces needed to complete key recovery is reduced.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the integration of deep learning technology with Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) methods to effectively analyze the Curve-25519 algorithm implemented on an MCU chip. The Curve-25519 algorithm, protected by the security features of elliptical curve algorithms and constant-time operations, presents a challenge for low-cost, non-invasive SCA methods due to its robustness. This work focuses on the leakage of conditional judgment operations that occur before each point addition and point doubling operation. By identifying these information leakage points through SCA, electromagnetic radiation and power consumption information are collected and labeled. We conduct a dataset and transformed 1-dimensional signals into a 2D image for training. The trained model is subsequently used for testing. Experiments demonstrate that this method can effectively analyze leakage points in the Curve-25519 algorithm and help to improve the robustness of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence has brought significant opportunities for the advancement of digital humanities research. Intelligent processing of ancient texts, as an essential part of digital humanities, is also undergoing a transformation in research methodologies in the wave of AIGC. The integration of generative pre-trained models with Chinese ancient texts, a vital carrier of Chinese culture, allows for deep mining of the content of these texts and provides services that make ancient texts more understandable and accessible to the general public. In this research, we propose a method that combines the most renowned Chinese anthology, the “Siku Quanshu,” with generative pre-trained models. We developed the SikuGPT model, a generative model for ancient text processing tasks, based on GPT-type language models by continued pretraining. This model was tested on two typical tasks of ancient text processing: translation between classical and modern Chinese, and classification of ancient texts. The findings reveal that our model achieves advantages in understanding and generating scenarios of ancient texts. The capability of SikuGPT in processing traditional Chinese texts helps to promote the organization of ancient information and knowledge services, and advances the international dissemination of traditional Chinese culture.},

  abstract = {In soccer, the development of science and technology is committed to the intelligent analysis and autonomous judgment of athletes' behavior. Nowadays, soccer has been deeply integrated with artificial intelligence, and this paper combines artificial intelligence technology with deep learning, and for the difficult task of detecting players and soccer, firstly, we propose to use the deep learning-based image segmentation technology Mask R-CNN, and optimize the related computation by using residual network + feature pyramid network + RoI Align, and using binary cross-entropy loss function to predict the Pixel category not only highlights the boundaries of the image compared to traditional target detection methods, but also achieves pixel-level segmentation of each detection target, and achieves more accurate detection of players and soccer balls. Based on this, another algorithm optimized YOLOv3 is proposed for the lack of speed of Mask R-CNN, which employs a more efficient feature extraction network - -GhostNet and choosing a more appropriate a priori frame size and number and proposing the CIoU loss function for calculating the loss value of target localization to achieve a more efficient and lightweight detection of targets. Finally, for the simulated match, with the clubs, players, and soccer balls of both sides of the match as the detection targets, the data such as passes, shots, players' activity ranges, and other specific tasks are visualized and analyzed at the macro, meso, and micro levels.},

An exciting area of development is the use of AI to automate the deductive rule-based reasoning inherent in statutory and contract law. This paper argues that such automated deductive legal reasoning can now be viewed from the lens of software engineering, treating LLMs as interpreters of natural-language programs with natural-language inputs. We show how it is possible to apply principled software engineering techniques to enhance AI-driven legal reasoning of complex statutes and to unlock new applications in automated meta-reasoning such as mutation-guided example generation and metamorphic property-based testing.},

  abstract = {Usually, a soil profile ruler is located vertically on a soil profile, which is an important reference for horizontal and vertical correction of soil profile images. So, it will be detected with an improved YOLOv5 to raise its accuracy. Firstly, training samples will be expanded to solve the problem that soil profile images are less. Then to boost the detection accuracy and enhance generalization ability of the model, this paper adopts transfer learning and injects Channel Attention mechanism into YOLOv5 backbone network. Finally, the experimental sample set was used to conduct comparative experiments on soil profile ruler detection between the algorithm in this paper and other target detection algorithms to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the improved YOLOv5s model exhibits an increase of 3.7\% in precision, 1.6\% in recall, 2.1\% in mAP50, and 1.5\% in mAP50-90 compared with the original YOLOv5s model. After YOLOv5s is trained with transfer learning, the improved YOLOv5s model exhibits an increase of 2.2\% in precision, 2.9\% in recall, 0.3\% in mAP50, and 7.8\% in mAP50-90. compared with YOLOv3 -tiny, YOLOv5m, YOLOv6 and YOLOv8s of the YOLO series, the algorithm in this paper demonstrates better accuracy, recall and mAP50. The above experimental results confirm that the algorithm proposed in this paper is effective and can accurately detect the soil profile ruler in the image.},

  abstract = {In the past years, a growing number of highly-automated systems has build on Artificial-Intelligence (AI) capabilities, for example, self-driving vehicles or predictive health-state diagnoses. As for any software system, there is a risk that misbehavior occurs (e.g., system failure due to bugs) or that malicious actors aim to misuse the system (e.g., generating attack scripts), which can lead to safety and security incidents. While software safety and security incidents have been studied in the past, we are not aware of research focusing on the specifics of AI incidents. With this paper, we aim to shed light on this gap through a case survey of 240 incidents that we elicited from four datasets comprising safety and security incidents involving AI from 2014 to 2023. Using manual data analyses and automated topic modeling, we derived relevant topics as well as the major issues and contexts in which the incidents occurred. We find that the topic of AI incidents is, not surprisingly, becoming more and more relevant, particularly in the contexts of autonomous driving and process-automation robotics. Regarding security and its intersection with safety, most incidents connect to generative AI (i.e., large-language models, deep fakes) and computer-vision systems (i.e., facial recognition). This emphasizes the importance of security to also ensure safety in the context of AI systems, with our results further revealing a high number of serious consequences (system compromise, human injuries) and major violations of confidentiality, integrity, availability, as well as authorization. We hope to support practitioners and researchers in understanding major safety and security issues to support the development of more secure, safe, and trustworthy AI systems.},

  abstract = {In the digital age of the 21st century, with the widespread use of Web applications, SQL injection attacks have become one of the significant challenges in the field of information security. This study proposes a method for detecting SQL injection attacks based on an improved Text-CNN model. The method starts with the preprocessing of collected SQL injection attack data, followed by the use of the convolutional layers of the Text-CNN model to extract local features, and then combines the CAM attention mechanism to achieve the task of SQL injection detection. The introduction of the CAM attention mechanism aims to merge the information from max pooling and average pooling to reduce information loss and enhance the global representation capability of the model. Experimental results show that the proposed method has improved in terms of accuracy, precision, recall rate, and F1 score, with values of 92.40\%, 92.45\%, 92.29\%, and 0.9237, respectively. Given that traditional Text-CNN, Text-RNN, and CNN algorithms can perform well in recognizing SQL injection attacks, this provides help for subsequent applications in network security protection.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence tools (Generative AI), such as ChatGPT, allow users to interact with them in intuitive ways (e.g., conversational) and receive (mostly) good-quality answers. In education, such systems can support students’ learning objectives by providing accessible explanations and examples even when students pose vague queries. But, they also encourage undesired help-seeking behaviors, such as by providing solutions to the students’ homework. Therefore, it is important to better understand how students approach such tools and the potential issues such approaches might present for the learners.In this paper, we present a case study for understanding student-AI collaboration to solve programming tasks in the CS1 introductory programming course. To this end, we recruited a gender-balanced majority non-white set of 15 CS1 students at the University of Houston, a large public university in the US. We observed them solving programming tasks. We used a mixed-method approach to study their interactions as they tackled Python programming tasks, focusing on when and why they used ChatGPT for problem-solving. We analyze and classify the questions submitted by the 15 participants to ChatGPT. Additionally, we analyzed user interaction patterns, their reactions to ChatGPT’s responses, and the potential impacts of Generative AI on their perception of self-efficacy.Our results suggest that, in about a third of the cases, the student attempted to complete the task by submitting the full description of the tasks to ChatGPT without making any effort on their own. We also observed that few students verified their solutions. We discuss the potential implications of these results.},

  abstract = {Investigation of students’ perceptions and opinions on the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education is a topic gaining much interest. Studies addressing this are typically conducted with large heterogeneous groups, at one moment in time. However, how students perceive and use GenAI tools can potentially depend on many factors, including their background knowledge, familiarity with the tools, and the learning goals and policies of the courses they are taking. In this study we explore how students following computing courses use GenAI for programming-related tasks across different programs and courses: Bachelor and Master, in courses in which learning programming is the learning goal, courses that require programming as a means to achieve another goal, and in courses in which programming is optional, but can be useful. We are also interested in changes over time, since GenAI capabilities are changing at a fast pace, and users are adopting GenAI increasingly. We conducted three consecutive surveys (fall ‘23, winter ‘23, and spring ‘24) among students of all computing programs of a large European research university. We asked questions on the use in education, ethics, and job prospects, and we included specific questions on the (dis)allowed use of GenAI tools in the courses they were taking at the time. We received 264 responses, which we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, to find out how students have employed GenAI tools across 59 different computing courses, and whether the opinion of an average student about these tools evolves over time. Our study contributes to the emerging discussion of how to differentiate GenAI use across different courses, and how to align its use with the learning goals of a computing course.},

  abstract = {Recent studies revealed an overwhelming concern about the misuse of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools by students in completing academic requirements. The detection of AI-generated content using the naked eye was perceived to be difficult, hence the need for more accurate, reliable, and effective detection methods. As a countermeasure, educators are turning to AI content detectors and plagiarism checkers to ascertain the originality of submitted school requirements, raising concerns from students regarding the accuracy and reliability of these tools and the ethical implications and negative consequences of misclassification of genuinely original works as machine-generated outputs. By employing a holistic case study approach, the authors attempted to determine the perceptions of selected university students on the use of AI detection systems by faculty members in checking the originality and novelty of their academic outputs. Through the lenses of various normative ethical theories, the authors also analyzed the ethical issues and concerns raised by selected students to better understand their sentiments and the factors they believe could influence the faculty members' intention to adopt this emerging technology. The results of the study revealed that students have mixed attitudes and perceptions toward the faculty's intention to use AI detectors. While students perceived it as a means to encourage independent learning and critical thinking, they also expressed valid concerns regarding fairness, accuracy, and reliability, the impact on teacher-student trust, and the responsible use of the technology, among others. The participants also acknowledged the influence of other faculty members and the students' increasing dependence on AI as possible enablers of technology adoption while technological limitations, the teachers’ lack of technological skills, and age as perceived barriers. From an ethical view, the findings of the study highlighted the importance of transparency, fairness, privacy, and the need for a policy to regulate AI use.},

  abstract = {In general, grammar polishing systems recombine words and their order of combination based on the comparison results of word combinations and large vocabulary grammar data to achieve error polishing. However, this process is limited by the storage capacity of the large vocabulary grammar, which hampers the effectiveness and efficiency of error polishing. To overcome this constraint, deep learning algorithms are employed. These algorithms involve reconstructing the underlying hardware framework and optimizing the error polishing calculation parameters of the system software using deep learning algorithms. This allows for global replacement of deep learning algorithms, enhances the system's self-learning ability for error polishing, and frees it from the limitations of large vocabulary grammar information. The test results demonstrate that the continuous error polishing ability of this approach is superior. Among the error polishing systems tested, the designed system exhibits the best overall stress test performance, showcasing strong stability and control. The overall stability demonstrated by the stress test aligns with the standards and requirements of practical applications. As a result, the design system possesses good overall error polishing ability, system stability, and practical applicability.},

  abstract = {Collaboration can amalgamate diverse ideas, styles, and visual elements, fostering creativity and innovation among different designers. In collaborative design, sketches play a pivotal role as a means of expressing design creativity. However, designers often tend to not openly share these meticulously crafted sketches. This phenomenon of data island in the design area hinders its digital transformation under the third wave of AI. In this paper, we introduce a Federated Generative Artificial Intelligence Clothing system, namely StyleWe, employing federated learning to aid in sketch design. StyleWe is committed to establishing an ecosystem wherein designers can exchange sketch styles among themselves. Through StyleWe, designers can generate sketches that incorporate various designers' styles from their peers, drawing inspiration from collaboration without the need for data disclosure or upload. Extensive performance evaluations and user studies indicate that our StyleWe system can produce multi-styled sketches of comparable quality to human-designed ones while significantly enhancing efficiency compared to hand-drawn sketches.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) allow for more sophisticated modeling and simulation of complex engineering systems. This research explores the application of AI techniques like neural networks and genetic algorithms for multiphysics modeling, using an aerospace case example for educational purposes. A literature review examines existing physics-based and empirical modeling approaches in this domain. Subsequently, a multiphysics control model incorporating thermal, structural, and fluid dynamics interactions is developed. Neural networks can be trained on simulation data to learn these multiphysics relationships, with the potential to augment robotic assembly. Additionally, genetic algorithms optimize system designs by evolving populations of models based on performance objectives. This enables rapid virtual testing and discovery of optimal configurations. The integrated AI modeling framework builds on a systematic literature review, providing a reference architecture for multiphysics modeling and simulation. Literature findings facilitate developing an optimal methodology for a model example. The research demonstrates advancing complex engineering models via a sample pseudocode algorithm for electronic systems control. Integrative systems engineering research can enhance simulation-driven design. This pseudocode contributes knowledge on AI-driven multiphysics modeling within a scientific framework. The proposed technique has applications in innovating systems-level designs with prudent limitations.},

  abstract = {Search is far from being a solved problem. While search engines may cope well with simple tasks, searchers and systems struggle as task complexity increases. Task is central to the search process, motivating the search and driving search behavior. Complex search tasks require more than support for rudimentary fact finding or re-finding. Various support options have been offered by search systems over time (e.g., query suggestions, contextual search) to help search engine users more effectively tackle complex tasks. The recent emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and the arrival of assistive agents, or copilots, based on this technology, has the potential to offer further assistance to searchers, especially those engaged in complex tasks. The implications from these advances for the design of intelligent systems and for the future of search itself are significant. This overview of the keynote that I gave at the 2023 ACM SIGIR Conference introduces AI copilots and briefly presents some of the challenges and opportunities for researching, developing, and deploying search copilots.Date: 26 July 2023.},

  abstract = {In Summer 2023, we developed and integrated a suite of AI-based software tools into CS50 at Harvard University. These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course's own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had "a personal tutor.'' Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues. In this paper, we detail how AI tools have augmented teaching and learning in CS50, specifically in explaining code snippets, improving code style, and accurately responding to curricular and administrative queries on the course's discussion forum. Additionally, we present our methodological approach, implementation details, and guidance for those considering using these tools or AI generally in education.},

Moreover, making students realize the importance and benefits of refactoring is also challenging. To address this complexity, we introduce a refactoring teaching method based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), incorporating single-loop and double-loop learning principles, focusing on fostering deeper and critical learning. We used ChatGPT, a GAI-based tool, and conducted an eight-week mixed-methods study involving 23 computer science undergraduate students. The study involved applying four distinct projects extracted from GitHub, where participants were tasked with identifying code smells and performing the necessary refactoring to improve code quality. The primary focus was on identifying both the positive and negative aspects of the method, as well as delineating the computational thinking characteristics developed during the process. The results indicate that the use of ChatGPT facilitated the learning of refactoring, contributing to the development of numerous computational thinking skills, especially problem formulation, decomposition, and abstraction. Thus, this paper contributes a GAI-based teaching method along with evidence on how it helps students develop refactoring skills.},

  abstract = {Dialogue is the basis of collaborative problem solving, and the development of generative artificial intelligence has made dialogue no longer limited to human-to-human, and human-computer dialogue has gradually become an important way for people to solve problems. At the same time, with the change of the subject of collaborative problem solving, the cultivation of collaborative problem-solving skill urgently needs to explore a new path. In this regard, more and more studies have begun to apply conversational agents in collaborative problem-solving activities, digging deeper into the effects of time on students in conversational agents. However, there is no clear answer to the question of how conversational agents can be better integrated into a collaborative environment for all to assist people in the collaborative problem-solving process and improve performance. In this study, we constructed a conceptual model of human-computer collaboration in order to improve students' learning performance. Based on this model, we integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generative and GPT to construct a conversational agent, and the results of the study showed that the Retrieval-Augmented Generative Agent for Collaborative Problem Solving constructed in this study can effectively promote students' collaborative problem-solving performance.},

  abstract = {Policy advising in government centers on the analysis of public problems and the developing of recommendations for dealing with them. In carrying out this work, policy analysts consult a variety of sources and work to synthesize that body of evidence into useful decision support documents commonly called briefing notes. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) have led to the continuing development of tools that can undertake a similar task. Given a brief prompt, a large language model (LLM) can synthesize information in content databases. This article documents the findings from an experiment that tested whether contemporary NLP technology is capable of producing public policy relevant briefing notes that expert evaluators judge to be useful. The research involved two stages. First, briefing notes were created using three models: NLP generated; human generated; and NLP generated/human edited. Next, two panels of retired senior public servants (with only one panel informed of the use of NLP in the experiment) were asked to judge the briefing notes using a heuristic evaluation rubric. The findings indicate that contemporary NLP tools were not able to, on their own, generate useful policy briefings. However, the feedback from the expert evaluators indicates that automatically generated briefing notes might serve as a useful supplement to the work of human policy analysts. And the speed with which the capabilities of NLP tools are developing, supplemented with access to a larger corpus of previously prepared policy briefings and other policy-relevant material, suggests that the quality of automatically generated briefings may improve significantly in the coming years. The article concludes with reflections on what such improvements might mean for the future practice of policy analysis.},

Therefore, this paper moves data processing and analysis from the centralized cloud to the edge of the network, near the user access point, aiming to reduce data transfer time and improve response speed, and utilizes artificial intelligence technology to enable more efficient and adaptive network management and service customization. This paper focuses on the role and advantages of edge computing in 5G communication, the application of artificial intelligence combined with edge computing in 5G communication, and the realization of edge AI technology architecture. Finally, two sets of simulation results are as follows: The average accuracy error of the optimized edge AI model and cloud AI model is less than 1\%, and the average response time is reduced by 31.9ms. The research helps to better understand network behavior, predict and manage traffic, and dynamically deploy resources.},

Recent advances in generative AI have attracted growing interest to the possibility of replacing human participants in these domains with AI surrogates. We survey several such “substitution proposals” to better understand the arguments for and against substituting human participants with modern generative AI. Our scoping review indicates that the recent wave of these proposals is motivated by goals such as reducing the costs of research and development work and increasing the diversity of collected data. However, these proposals ignore and ultimately conflict with foundational values of work with human participants: representation, inclusion, and understanding. This paper critically examines the principles and goals underlying human participation to help chart out paths for future work that truly centers and empowers participants.},

  abstract = {AI-pair programming is a novel approach to software development that involves a human developer and an AI assistant working together on the same code. AI-pair programming aims to improve the productivity, quality, and creativity of software development by leveraging the complementary strengths of human and AI agents. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on its impact on code quality and developer satisfaction. In this paper, we conduct a case study of TiMi studio, a leading mobile game development studio group that has been using AI-pair programming tools since 2023, and has produced several popular and high-quality games. We collect and analyze data from code repositories, code reviews, developer surveys, and developer interviews, to measure and compare the code quality and developer satisfaction of AI-pair and non-AI-pair projects. The results show that AI-pair programming has a positive impact on code quality and developer satisfaction, as it offers various benefits, such as time-saving, error-avoiding, skill-learning, possibility-exploring, feedback-receiving, and quality-improving. The results also reveal some challenges, such as reliability-questioning, explainability-questioning, trust-lacking, communication-lacking, autonomy-losing, and motivation-losing, which need to be addressed and overcome by improving and enhancing the AI-pair programming tools and practices. The paper provides empirical and practical evidence on the impact of AI-pair programming on code quality and developer satisfaction, and provides useful and actionable insights and guidance for developers, managers, researchers, and educators, who are interested in or involved in AI-pair programming, and who want to improve and optimize their software development process and outcomes.},

As educators, we need to understand the potential and limitations of AI in HCI education and ensure our graduating HCI students are aware of the potential and limitations of AI in HCI. In this paper, we report on the main pedagogical insights gained from the inclusion of generative AI into a 10-week undergraduate module. We designed the module to encourage student experimentation with GAI models as part of the design brief requirement and planned practical sessions and discussions. Our insights are based on replies to a survey sent out to the students after completing the module. Our key findings, for HCI educators, report on the use of AI as a persona for developing project ideas and creating resources for design, and AI as a mirror for reflecting students’ understanding of key concepts and ideas and highlighting knowledge gaps. We also discuss potential pitfalls that should be considered and the need to assess students’ literacies and assumptions of GAIs as pedagogical tools. Finally, we put forward the case for educators to take the opportunities GAI presents as an educational tool and be experimental, creative, and courageous in their practice. We end with a discussion of our findings in relation to the TPACK framework in HCI.},

  abstract = {With the recent advancement in technology, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can produce hyper-realistic multimedia content, such as audio, text, images, and videos. Although this technology has raised great concerns about its misuse and harmful applications, it holds great potential to revolutionize traditional ways of teaching and learning. The use of GenAI in education has increased markedly, however, pedagogical research on this rapidly emerging technology is yet to be studied extensively. There is an urgent need to investigate the unexamined potential of this technology. Therefore, this ongoing research will explore the potential of AI-generated pedagogical agents (PA), or avatars, in instructional videos to facilitate learning. The effects of the type of PA (AI-generated, real-life human), and voice (AI-generated, human voice) on an individual's learning outcomes, cognitive load, motivation, and attention will be studied. Findings from a pilot study provide some preliminary evidence that PA appearance influences learners’ retention and cognitive load, but not attention. The type of PA influenced learners' perception of the agent's ability to facilitate learning, its human-like qualities, and its engagement level. However, it did not affect its credibility. This ongoing work will contribute to the growing understanding of the impact of AI in education, provide evidence of the efficacy of AI-generated PAs in instructional videos for learning, and narrow the gap between human-computer interaction research and education.},

  abstract = {As generative AI applications such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALL·E, Bard, and others increase in ubiquity, concerns about the negative implications of these technologies are becoming more present in public discourse. However, little research has examined the impact that generative AI stands to have on African consumers and users who may be affected by its application in various fields such as education, healthcare, and social media. This work presents an early look into the implications of using generative AI within African contexts, exploring case studies of current generative AI use within Africa. These case studies examine the use of generative AI in marketing and for image and text generation. While the potential for generative AI in Africa is growing, this preliminary work aims to set a foundation for highlighting risks associated with generative AI while exploring how generative AI can be responsibly developed and used within African contexts.},

In the calculations of the index under con-sideration, four countries of the post-Soviet period were presented, which were divided according to the results: three of them (Latvia, Russia and Estonia) were included in the second cluster, which has an intermediate level of the Global AI Index, and one country (Armenia) was included in the third cluster, value index for which it turned out to be minimal. For the most representative (second) cluster of countries, it was found that the strength of the connection between the assessment of artificial intelligence and the level of employment is weak; the ratio of these indicators is very different across countries.},

  abstract = {We propose an algorithm for road crack detection, leveraging enhancements to YOLOv7. This approach aims to overcome challenges related to the limited capacity for extracting features from irregularly shaped road crack targets and the sluggish inference speed caused by the intricate model structure. In this algorithm, YOLOv7 is used as the foundation. Firstly, the Detect module is improved to a Decoupled Head Detect module to augment the detection capacity of the model on feature maps. Then, the Head part is augmented with an ELAN-G module based on GSConv to reduce the model's parameter computation and accelerate the inference speed. Finally, Deformable Conv is employed to modify the original ELAN module into an ELAN-D module and integrate it into the Backbone part to bolster the model's capability in extracting irregular-shaped crack targets. Experimental results on the CRDDC-2020-US dataset demonstrate that the improved algorithm achieves a 10\% enhancement in detection accuracy, with the mAP(0.5) increasing from 53.7\% to 59.4\%. Furthermore, the model's parameter computation is decreased by 12\%, while the throughput in terms of the number of images processed per second during inference is boosted by 13\%. This algorithm proves to be effective for road crack detection applications.},

AI has further pervaded private conversations as conversational partners, auto-completion, and response suggestions. As social media becomes young people’s main method of peer support exchange, we need to understand when and how AI can facilitate and assist in such exchanges in a beneficial, safe, and socially appropriate way. We asked 622 young people to complete an online survey and evaluate blinded human- and AI-generated responses to help-seeking messages. We found that participants preferred the AI-generated response to situations about relationships, self-expression, and physical health. However, when addressing a sensitive topic, like suicidal thoughts, young people preferred the human response. We also discuss the role of training in online peer support exchange and its implications for supporting young people’s well-being.

AI has been acknowledged for its potential to enhance innovation activities by providing support in various aspects. The intersection of these areas offers promising opportunities for improved idea generation, classification, development, and evaluation. However, AI's impact is not equally present for the different stages of an innovation process, showing more prominence in the idea generation stage. Through an integrative review, we can explore how AI has contributed to different steps of innovation processes implemented through IMS. AI-driven approaches, so far, have been opening possibilities to manage creative processes, such as automating specific tasks, analyzing large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends, and providing real-time feedback to enhance ideation and decision-making. Assessing the contribution of AI to innovation and creativity is vital in understanding its potential influence on the future developments of IMS and innovation processes.},

  abstract = {Manual verification has become very challenging based on the increasing volume of information shared online and the role of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Thus, AI systems are used to identify disinformation and deep fakes online. Previous research has shown that superior performance can be observed when combining AI and human expertise. Moreover, according to the EU AI Act, human oversight is inevitable when using AI systems in a domain where fundamental human rights, such as the right to free expression, might be affected. Thus, AI systems need to be transparent and offer sufficient explanations to be comprehensible. Much research has been done on integrating eXplainability (XAI) features to increase the transparency of AI systems; however, they lack human-centered evaluation. Additionally, the meaningfulness of explanations varies depending on users’ background knowledge and individual factors. Thus, this research implements a human-centered evaluation schema to evaluate different XAI features for the collaborative human-AI disinformation detection task. Hereby, objective and subjective evaluation dimensions, such as performance, perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust in the AI system, are used to evaluate different XAI features. A user study was conducted with an overall total of 433 participants, whereas 406 crowdworkers and 27 journalists participated as experts in detecting disinformation. The results show that free-text explanations contribute to improving non-expert performance but do not influence the performance of experts. The XAI features increase the perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust in the AI system, but they can also lead crowdworkers to blindly trust the AI system when its predictions are wrong.},

Thanks to generative artificial intelligence, tools that once could only be used by highly qualified technical personnel are now in the hands of potentially inexperienced users, but unfortunately, the understanding of the layman is very far from the machinery behind the scenes. More than ever, it is necessary to help people develop an awareness that allows them to use these tools in an appropriate way and with the appropriate expectations. We believe this problem should be addressed by exploring ways to train thinking strategies to facilitate understanding of machine learning concepts that can be applied in daily life, not just by developing teaching tools on this or that topic.

This strategy allows for offering a research proposal grounded on social and technological dimensions and providing a comprehensive diagnosis, including perceived challenges in the AI industry, the regulatory debate, ethical dilemmas, etc. By delving into these areas, we aim to design a post-audit tool to ensure models are trustworthy, socially responsible, and in alignment with human rights. Additionally, we aim to encourage responsible AI Innovation through Ethics-Driven Incentives. Supervisor: Prof. Danilo Caivano, danilo.caivano@uniba.it, University of Bari "A.

Other phases in the Software Engineering process have been less explored. In this paper, we argue that more investigation is needed on the support that GenAI can provide to the design, and operation of software systems, i.e., a number of crucial activities, beyond coding, that are necessary to successfully deliver and maintain software services. These include reasoning about architectural choices and dealing with third-party platforms.        We discuss crucial aspects of AI for software systems. taking as a use case Function as a Service (FaaS).We present several challenges, including cold start delays, stateless functions, debugging complexities, and vendor lock-in and explore the potential of GenAI tools to mitigate FaaS challenges.

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is fundamentally changing the ways of working and blurring the boundaries between human and machine-generated contents. While there is an increasing interest in the adoption of GAI systems, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, there are also serious concerns about the copyright of the contents—the inputs or generated as outputs by the GAI systems. Such concerns need to be identified and assessed to ensure the ethical and responsible use of GAI systems. Thus, this article aims to address the key research challenge: “how to identify and assess GAI system's copyright concerns”? In response, we propose the development of a Copyright Risk Checker (CRC) Tool. This tool has been formulated and evaluated using a recognised design science research methodology, drawing on an analysis of 10 legal cases across Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. The CRC Tool has undergone evaluation through an experimental scenario, and the results suggest that it is suitable for conducting an indicative copyright risk check of GAI systems. The outcomes of this preliminary assessment can be further examined by expert legal advisors for an in-depth analysis. The development of the CRC Tool provides a foundation for continued research and advancement in this significant area of study.},

This can drastically impact users and the media sector, especially given global risks of misinformation. While the currently discussed European AI Act aims at addressing these risks through Article 52’s AI transparency obligations, its interpretation and implications remain unclear. In this early work, we adopt a participatory AI approach to derive key questions based on Article 52’s disclosure obligations. We ran two workshops with researchers, designers, and engineers across disciplines (N=16), where participants deconstructed Article 52’s relevant clauses using the 5W1H framework. We contribute a set of 149 questions clustered into five themes and 18 sub-themes. We believe these can not only help inform future legal developments and interpretations of Article 52, but also provide a starting point for Human-Computer Interaction research to (re-)examine disclosure transparency from a human-centered AI lens.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems bring innovative ways of information provision and knowledge delivery. In the public sector, generative AI has the potential to decrease bureaucratic discretion in the decision-making process. Increasing reliance on this technology brings challenges of unfair treatment, colonized responses from the system, and data governance. Because of historical interaction, tribal communities are the most underrepresented in policy planning and implementation. Indigenous communities suffer from the neglect of tribal sovereignty by the U.S. federal government and limited accessibility and literacy in the digital world. Generative AI systems exacerbate these challenges with insufficient tribal input. However, the negative impact can be alleviated with digital equity and knowledge cocreation. Digital equity emphasizes the importance of tribal knowledge representation, and knowledge cocreation focuses on the collaboration between Indigenous communities and relevant actors in data governance for generative AI systems. This study proposes two research questions to discuss tribal knowledge cocreation in generative AI systems: (1) what are the biases in the system responses from the tribal perspective? (2) what are the potential resolutions for these problems? The findings from in-depth interviews with tribal members in the U.S. indicate that the insufficient articulation of tribal culture, the lack of crucial tribal historical events, and the inappropriate appellation of tribal nations are the primary drawbacks in the system responses. From the Indigenous perspective, tribal oral traditions, native publications and documents, and collaboration with tribal governments can address the problems of generative AI responses. This study contributes to the theory development of digital equity and knowledge cocreation in tribal generative AI system responses. Policy recommendations and future research agendas are included in this research.},

These systems offer exciting capabilities for CS Education (CSEd), such as generating programs, that students can well utilize for their learning. Among the many dimensions that might affect the effective adoption of GenAI for CSEd, in this paper, we investigate students' trust. Trust in GenAI influences the extent to which students adopt GenAI, in turn affecting their learning. In this paper, we present results from a survey of 253 students at two large universities to understand how much they trust GenAI tools and their feedback on how GenAI impacts their performance in CS courses. Our results show that students have different levels of trust in GenAI. We also observe different levels of confidence and motivation, highlighting the need for further understanding of factors impacting trust.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are being applied to numerous applications from Healthcare to Cyber Security to Finance. For example, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are being applied to solve security problems such as malware analysis and insider threat detection. However, there are many challenges in applying ML algorithms for various applications. For example, (i) the ML algorithms may violate the privacy of individuals. This is because we can gather massive amounts of data and apply ML algorithms to the data to extract highly sensitive information. (ii) ML algorithms may show bias and be unfair to various segments of the population. (iii) ML algorithms themselves may be attacked possibly resulting in catastrophic errors including in cyber-physical systems such as transportation systems. Finally, (iv) the ML algorithms must be safe and not harm society. Therefore, when ML algorithms are applied to transportation systems for handling congestion, preventing accidents, and giving advice to drivers, we must ensure that they are secure, ensure privacy and fairness, as well as provide for the safe operation of the transportation systems. Other AY techniques such as Generative AI (GenAI) are also being applied not only to secure systems design but also to determine the attacks and potential solutions. This presentation is divided into two parts. First, we describe our research over the past decade on Trustworthy ML systems. These are systems that are secure as well as ensure privacy, fairness, and safety. We discuss our ensemble-based ML models for detecting attacks as well as our research on developing Adversarial Machine Learning techniques. We also discuss securing the Internet of Transportation systems that are based on traditional methods such as Extended Kalman Filters to detect cyberattacks. Second, Second, we discuss our work on Finally, we discuss the research we recently started as part of the USDOT National University Technology Center TraCR (Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency) led by Clemson University. In particular, we describe (i) the application of federated machine learning techniques for detecting attacks in transportation systems; (ii) publishing synthetic transportation data sets that preserve privacy, (iii) fairness algorithms for transportation systems, and (iv) examining how GenAI systems are being integrated with transportation systems to provide security. Our focus includes the following: · Data Privacy: We are designing a Privacy-aware Policy-based Data Management Framework for Transportation Systems. Our work involves collecting the requisite data and developing analysis tools to identify and quantify privacy risks. Existing privacy-preserving, differentially private synthetic data generation techniques, which tailor data utility for generic ML accuracy, are not well suited for specific applications. We are developing synthetic data generation tools for transportation systems applications. We will develop new ML algorithms that can leverage these datasets. · Fairness: We have developed a novel adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning algorithm, FairSAOML, which adapts to changing environments in both bias control and model precision. Our current work is focusing on adapting our framework to fairness in transportation systems. and control bias over time, especially ensuring group fairness across different protected sub-populations; identifying interesting attributes using explainable AI techniques that might help to mitigate bias and develop equitable algorithms. We have also developed a second system, FairDolce, that recognizes objects involving fairness constraints in a changing environment. We are adapting it to transportation applications. For example, pedestrian detection (whether or not the object being seen is a pedestrian) must be fair with respect to the race or gender of the individuals being detected under changing environments (e.g., rainy, cloudy sunny). Adversarial ML: Our prior work on adversarial ML models worked on traditional datasets such as network traffic data. Our current focus is on adapting our approach to AV-based sensor data. Our ML models are being applied to sensor data for object recognition and traffic management. These ML models may be attacked by the adversary. We will study various attack models and investigate ways of how interactions may occur between the model and the adversary and subsequently develop appropriate adversarial ML models that operate on the AV sensor data. · Attack Detection - Smart vehicles are often exposed to various attacks making it difficult for manufacturers to collaboratively train anomaly/attack detection models. Yet it would be ideal if all the data available across manufacturers could be used in building robust attack detection systems. To achieve this, we developed FAST-SV, which incorporates federated learning in conjunction with augmentation techniques to build a highly performant attack detection system for smart cars. Safety: Safety has been studied for cyber-physical systems and formal methods have been applied to specify safety properties and subsequently verify that the system satisfies the specifications. However, our goal is to ensure that the ML algorithms utilized by the transportation systems are safe. This would involve developing an AI Governance framework that would require transparency and explainability (among others) of the ML algorithms utilized by the transportation system.},

In this study, we documented the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) learning experience of seven students from two special schools who participated in a series of game design workshops. We analysed their learning process, usage, and perspectives of text-to-image GenAI through video analysis, questionnaire, and evaluation of design outputs. Our findings reveal the students' willingness to learn and utilise AI technology. This AI experience allows students, especially those who struggle with fine motor skills, to translate their ideas into digital images. Moreover, the text-to-image interaction enhances students' ability to convey their ideas in writing and develop their skills in conceptualisation. We also summarised significant human-AI interaction challenges, including difficulties with typing, Chinese and English spelling, and prompt writing. We conclude with recommendations for designing future inclusive human-AI interaction experiences for students with SEN in China.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has gained a great deal of recent attention with the release of Chat GPT 4. It has been praised for its ability to generate human-like responses but has perhaps faced even more criticism over potential concerns for biased responses, misinformation, and generation of harmful or inappropriate content. Chat GPT utilizes large sources of data to curate responses to all kinds of questions. The generative AI models are designed to be objective and avoid any sort of bias in their output. However, in the age of misinformation, social media, user-generated content and the 24-hour news cycle, biased information has never been more plentiful. This paper investigates the possibility of biased responses produced by Chat GPT 4 utilizing public data from biased media sources through Support Vector Machines. We find Chat GPT tends to have bias in its responses.},

  abstract = {With the popularization of big data and Internet of things technology, the amount of time series data is exploding, which makes anomaly detection in time series particularly important. Anomaly detection aims to find those data points or behaviors that do not conform to regular patterns. This study proposes an innovative unsupervised time series anomaly detection algorithm that is able to dynamically learn and adapt to anomalies in real-time data streams by combining reinforcement learning, spectral residual (SR), and variational encoder (VAE) techniques. We use a two-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) model and a self-attention network to build a reinforcement learning agent that is able to integrate temporal information of time series data to optimize policies. In addition, we propose a novel unsupervised reinforcement learning model by combining SR and VAE as the reward function. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the other four methods on two public datasets and one real-world dataset.},

However, generating automated End-to-End (E2E) tests can be time-consuming and challenging, especially for junior developers. This study investigates the use of ChatGPT, a popular Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) model, as an assistant in developing automated E2E test scripts for Android apps. We present an empirical study that compares the effort required to create E2E test scripts and the resulting reliability of these tests using two treatments: manually and assisted by ChatGPT. We used Gherkin, a domain-specific language that allows non-technical practitioners to define test scenarios using a human-readable syntax. Our findings indicate that using ChatGPT significantly reduces the time required to develop automated test scripts without compromising the reliability of the scripts. Statistical analysis shows a notable reduction in development time for the ChatGPT-assisted group compared to the manual group, with a large effect size. While the reliability of the tests did not show a significant difference between the two groups, the results suggest practical benefits in terms of efficiency.},

  abstract = {Among creative professionals, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has sparked excitement over its capabilities and fear over unanticipated consequences. How does GenAI impact User Experience Design (UXD) practice, and are fears warranted? We interviewed 20 UX Designers, with diverse experience and across companies (startups to large enterprises). We probed them to characterize their practices, and sample their attitudes, concerns, and expectations. We found that experienced designers are confident in their originality, creativity, and empathic skills, and find GenAI’s role as assistive. They emphasized the unique human factors of “enjoyment” and “agency”, where humans remain the arbiters of “AI alignment’’. However, skill degradation, job replacement, and creativity exhaustion can adversely impact junior designers. We discuss implications for human-GenAI collaboration, specifically copyright and ownership, human creativity and agency, and AI literacy and access. Through the lens of responsible and participatory AI, we contribute a deeper understanding of GenAI fears and opportunities for UXD.},

These methodologies involve abstractive summarization, extracting the core content from an input text and transforming it into natural sentences. Unlike fact-based documents, opinion-based documents require a thorough analysis of sentiment and understanding of the writer’s intention. However, existing models do not explicitly consider these factors. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel text summarization model that is specifically designed for opinion-based documents. Specifically, we identify the sentiment distribution of the entire document and train the summarization model to focus on major opinions that conform to the intended message while randomly masking minor opinions. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing summarization models in summarizing opinion-based documents, effectively capturing and highlighting the main opinions in the generated abstractive summaries.},

  abstract = {Aiming to improve communication and increase the access to available channels and tools, chatbots, or conversational agents, are being used to support people´s digital participation and foster civic engagement. However, conversational agents attend only expected cases of participation, that is, those based on e-consulting, e-decision making and e-informing. Hence, chatbots don´t concern non mapped cases of self-mobilization, besides there are problems in human-computer communication and in the transmission of information caused by digital divide that hinder peoples ‘participation. Literature review indicates that generative AI chatbot shall be used in non-expected interactions between human and conversational agents. Therefore, this paper discusses how chatbots could interact within self-mobilizations’ types of digital participation, concerning obstacles like lack of infrastructure and digital illiteracy. Using design science research, we propose the GenPart, a generative AI-chatbot model for enhancing people´s digital participation. We claim that this artifact can be used by researchers and practitioners who want to promote the integration between people, organizations, and information in digital platforms, promoting citizen participation and civic engagement.},

The technological framework employs AR for dynamic artifact interaction and in situ navigation, while VR capabilities facilitate virtual tours, broadening access for individuals with disabilities or those from distant geographies or socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Gamification transforms educational content into interactive experiences, fostering deeper engagement and learning. Moreover, aligning with the mission of museum institutions for cultural heritage preservation, a module for digital conservation and reconstruction was developed resorting to photogrammetry-based approaches. This module aims to create a virtual catalog accessible to both experts and the general public. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools automate tasks such as generating thematic quizzes for gamification and cataloging scanned artifacts. The system aims to improve the interpretative and educational potential of museum exhibits, modernizing visitor engagement while preserving the integrity of physical artifacts and spaces. Its continuous evolution aims to bridge traditional forms of cultural preservation and promotion with contemporary digital interaction techniques, leveraged from cost-effective publicly accessible edge technologies.},

  abstract = {As we advance in time, with the evolution of the computer industry and the escalating intricacy of diverse software, the demand for source code defects is also increasing.&nbsp;Traditional deep learning-based software defect detection methods perform well on synthetic defect datasets, but their performance on real software defect datasets is unsatisfactory. At the same time, pre-trained models derived from extensive data training are extensively employed in various NLP tasks and have achieved excellent results.&nbsp;Based on this background, this study introduces a software defect detection system leveraging CodeBERT and Bi-LSTM. This method first preprocesses and standardizes the C source code to minimize the impact of redundant information and reduce noise;&nbsp;Secondly, coding sequences are segmented and encoded using the CodeBERT pre-trained model, capturing the semantic features within the program's code and converting them into vectors containing code feature information and output;&nbsp;Then, the output of the received CodeBERT is processed through the Bi-LSTM network to acquire the structural composition inherent to the code and the semantic information of the positive and negative terms;&nbsp;Finally, the vectors containing source code features are classified using a fully connected network to determine whether the code segment has defects.&nbsp;To verify the impact of this approach, we used the cross-language benchmark test set CodeXGLUE proposed by Microsoft Research Institute for evaluating code tasks for validation. The results showed that this method had higher accuracy in detecting real software defect samples than other methods, indicating that the proposed method can effectively improve software defect detection capabilities.},

  abstract = {Abstract: At present, Artificial intelligence technology is extensively applied across diverse sectors of the social economy and daily life. Firstly, this study introduces the current research status and relevant theoretical basis at home and abroad. Secondly, this study analyzes and summarizes the key problems and optimization goals that need to be solved in intelligent evolutionary game theory. Finally, this study improves the genetic algorithm by constructing models of different levels, and designs a comprehensive iterative cross-validation strategy combined with genetic operators to achieve the optimal control effect of the final performance index. The results show that by optimizing the intelligent algorithm, the bit error rate of the system is reduced from 0.001 to 1e-25, which greatly reduces the possibility of data corruption. Moreover, the packet loss rate decreases with the increase of distance. The result of a packet loss rate of 0.0001 makes the wireless signal more stable in data transmission. It can be seen that the application of intelligent algorithms not only improves the performance of the system, but also improves the reliability of data transmission. This can improve the stability of the communication system in complex environments, and provide users with better, more secure and reliable experience and convenience services.},

However, with the complexity of terms in the electric power field, the generic word-based encoding approach of natural language understanding model fails to identify those domain phrases even if they appear in the training samples. To improve the semantic accuracy of special content labeling, this paper proposes a words-phrase fusion encoding NLU model with the help of domain corpus. We pre-train a phrase-level Bert model in the electric power field which is involved during the model encoding step to accurately capture the semantics of domain terms and perceive the boundary of phrases. Additionally, continuous consistency loss of sequences is added to the model to reduce the to reduce the misclassification of individual words in the phrases. Experiment with real dataset in power QA system demonstrates that our model helps improve semantic parsing accuracy on both training and untrained items, alleviates the complete dependency of the phrase encoding model on word segmentation results.},

Insight from reflexive thematic analysis revealed wide variation in attitudes toward GAI tools – from threat-oriented negative appraisals to identification of empowerment opportunities – which depended on the sense of agency and perceived control. The paper examines this finding in light of the Coping Model of User Adaptation and discusses designers’ metacognitive skills as possible underpinnings for their attitudes. Avenues for further research are identified accordingly.},

Co-housing communities typically have smaller personal spaces, closer neighbourly relationships, and engage in more mutually supportive sustainable practices. To understand such communities’ motivations and visions, we developed a speculative design tool that harnesses Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to facilitate the envisioning of alternative future scenarios that challenge prevailing values, beliefs, lifestyles, and ways of knowing in contemporary society. Within the context of co-housing communities, we conducted a participatory design study with participants in co-creating their future communities. This paper unpacks implications and also reflects on the co-design approach employing GenAI. Our main findings highlight that GenAI, as a catalyst for imagination, empowers individuals to create visualisations that pose questions through a plural and situated speculative discourse.},

As a mixed-abilities team, we investigated student experiences with GenAI tools by collecting survey and interview responses from 62 and 21 students with disabilities, respectively, across two universities to measure students’ use of GenAI tools and their perspectives on the impact of these tools in ways related to disability, university support, and sense of belonging. Despite concerns over potential risks of GenAI and unclear university policies, students described GenAI tools as a useful resource for personalizing learning, promoting self-care, and assisting with important self-advocacy work. Guidance demonstrating safe, acceptable uses of GenAI tools, along with clear policies and resources that acknowledge diverse student needs, were desired. We discuss implications of these tools for accessibility and inclusion in higher education.},

This short paper investigates GenAI tools, help-seeking preferences and the importance of peer support among first-year software engineering students (n=94). Our responses show that 50\% of the students use GenAI tools as the primary source of help-seeking, and 43\% report that using ChatGPT reduces their need to interact with peers. However, students generally recognize the importance of social interaction and peer support for their learning.

We introduce Design as an analytical element complementary to Woods and Wason's (2021) multi-pronged framework for analyzing Terms of Service (ToS) documents. Using a cluster of Adobe Generative AI ToS, we illustrate the necessity of including Design, which allows those invested in Communication Design (CD) and Technical and Professional Communication (TPC) to interrogate how or if design supports or undermines values related to user privacy, data ownership, and informed consent.

  abstract = {Depression is a big public health problem around the world. Like the traditional methods of screening, clinical assessments, and self-rating scales are among the limits. These methods are based on the subjectivity of patient reports and the experience of doctors and clearly can have bias. In addition, they do not permit real-time monitoring of changes in mood. For this reason, this field of mental health is challenged with accurately and efficiently detecting probable mood changes in individuals at risk for depression. To resolve these challenges, we then propose a BERT-based sentimental analysis model adapted for depression-related text. Current methods for screening for traditional depression and established sentiment analysis models are hindered by data scarcity, data imbalance, and the problems of deriving emotional changes in a dynamic and clean manner. To leverage the strengths of BERTs in our model, we train the last layer of BERTs and then construct a classification layer tailored to the depressive emotion, which is more sensitive to the semantic information of the mood. Moreover, we also present data augmentation in its simplest form, which is the rearrangement of positive samples to increase the diversity of samples while still preserving the semantic meaning. To tackle data imbalance, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism to the BCEWithLogitsLoss function by adjusting the weight of the positive samples with data distribution. The model effectively captures the complex emotional changes by combining global and local semantic dynamic representations. In our empirical study, we analyze the open-source dataset of interview transcripts of 162 volunteers. Our model is evaluated using the experimental results, and the precision, the recall rate, and the F1 score obtained are 0.667, 0.667, and 0.667, respectively. Our model has achieved 2.62 higher in terms of precision and F1 score as compared to the existing models. The results indicate that our model provides a big benefit in identifying screened individuals at risk for depression.},

  abstract = {With the wide deployment of deep learning models in various applications, the reliability problem of neural networks has gradually become a research hotspot. Computer systems are susceptible to single-particle effects, electromagnetic interference, and other factors in complex environments, resulting in frequent bit-flipping faults. Among them, Silent Data Corruption (SDC), as an imperceptible fault, cannot be detected by the system, which ultimately destroys the output results of neural network models. Current SDC detection techniques mainly focus on the system instruction stream level, and lack efficient methods to implement detection reinforcement at the model level. In addition, due to the black-box weight update mechanism of neural networks, traditional selective redundancy methods cannot provide a reliable explanation of which important weights to fix. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network Reinforcement Framework Based on Neural Network Interpretability (RFNI). RFNI explores the redundancy ratio of convolutional kernels by performing layer-by-layer search in convolutional neural networks through SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) agent; secondly, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated by combining with neural network interpretability algorithms; and finally, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated based on the total Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS). Second, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated by combining with the neural network interpretable algorithm; finally, the granularity configurable redundancy reinforcement is implemented based on the total floating point operations per second (FLOPS). The experimental results show that RFNI on multiple neural network architectures significantly improves the recognition accuracy in case of SDC over existing methods, and can effectively enhance the robustness of the model.},

  abstract = {Starting in November 2022 with the free provision of ChatGPT, large language models (LLM) are now publicly available. This has significantly increased the number of publications that scope potential changes caused by the application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in various societal domains. The private use of AI and the economic integration of generative LLMs have increased significantly. However, for parliamentarians and parliamentary professionals, the technology often remains abstract, impacting everyday work only peripherally. Due to the special responsibility of parliaments, governments, and administrations as the organizational instances of society, and through the inherent legitimations by society itself, there is a necessity to examine the implications of the use of generative LLMs within these institutions and traditional structures as well as their influence on political system logic. The article analyzes the responses that the generative LLMs GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 have provided via ChatGPT, based on the same input command (prompt) over different times. The responses help to assess how LLMs can be used in the parliamentary context, to reflect what dangers exist as well as to respond to the question on how a business model of an AI department in parliament might look like. Furthermore, it shall be explored whether there are fluctuations in the quality of the responses and how these should be evaluated against the backdrop of the need for accurate and precise workflows in parliamentary operations. Ultimately, the article aims to provide an answer as to whether the application of ChatGPT together with the LLMs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 could already deliver this necessary quality and consistency for the parliamentarian working environment today.},

  abstract = {Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning, as it leverages multiple MRI modalities to provide complementary diagnostic information. However, missing modalities are frequently en- countered in clinical practice due to factors such as image degradation, artifacts, protocol inconsistencies, or patient con- traindications to contrast agents. While certain unified models are designed to accommodate various missing modality scenarios, their performance declines markedly when multiple modalities are absent, particularly in cases where only a single modality is available. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a Guided- learning Network that leverages dynamic FFT filters. This network trains multiple specialized models designed for different missing modality scenarios, achieving outstanding performance. The architecture comprises two distinct learning paths: one dedicated to capturing multimodal information and another focused on generating modality-specific representations for the missing modality. A guided-learning strategy connects these two paths. Initially, the multimodal path is trained and its parameters are locked, enabling the missing modality path to learn under its guidance. The training process incorporates several key com- ponents: adversarial learning to align high-level features across paths, frequency-domain adaptive filtering using dynamic FFT filters to extract global features, and mutual information transfer to ensure critical information is retained even when modality data is missing. Experiments conducted on the BraTS2018 dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms comparable state-of- the-art methods in all missing modality cases.},

This paper establishes network security knowledge graph based on CAPEC, CWE and other security libraries. Aiming at the problem that TransR model cannot utilize entity semantic information, TransR-Roberta model is proposed, and splicing layer, attention layer and convolutional layer are added on the basis of TransR model. And for the problem that the quality of negative samples generated by Bernoulli negative sampling is too low, a clustering-based negative sampling optimization method is proposed. Firstly, the clustering task is accomplished with the help of Gaussian hybrid clustering algorithm on the entities in the security vulnerability knowledge graph to label the entities with clusters. In the next step, the clustered vulnerability entities are reclassified using support vector machine. Finally, a classifier combined with Facolloss function is added to the loss function of the TransR model, which is used to improve the ability of the knowledge inference model to distinguish between positive and negative samples. The experimental results show that the improved model improves the hit@N, MR and MMR metrics for the knowledge reasoning task.},

Based on re-parameterization, a multi-level feature generation module (MFGM) is designed to extract feature mappings from different perspectives. Then, to enhance feature details, a feature refinement module (FRM) is constructed to aggregate high-frequency information, which can assign weight values to pixels in feature maps according to the importance of different hierarchical features. Through many experiments, our proposed method shows excellent image reconstruction results in a lightweight way on multiple benchmark datasets and exceeds the current advanced methods.},

Using this hybrid approach, we conducted new word discovery experiments on a self-annotated dataset, utilizing word embedding vectors and different word position annotation sets. The results demonstrate that the IM-BI-LSTM-CRF model surpasses traditional LSTM and BI-LSTM models in new word discovery and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the global digital transformation of healthcare is advancing rapidly with the help of technologies such as electronic medical records, telemedicine, and mobile medical applications. However, there are still challenges in EMR interoperability, security, and data exchange. To address these existing limitations, This study proposes a voice electronic medical record system driven by artificial intelligence and blockchain, which is designed to improve clinical records and nursing coordination. This system adopts a dedicated deep learning architecture. It transcribe the conversations between doctors and patients into text, and then uses natural language processing to extract the relevant medical information. At the same time, it also provides diagnostic prompts, which can reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Doctors can view and edit these summaries generated by artificial intelligence. Then safely record them on the decentralized crypto blockchain ledger. With federated learning, the model can be continuously improved in multiple centers without infringing on data privacy. This solution integrates automatic speech recognition, distributed ledger technology, and collaborative deep learning, aiming to enhance the EMR efficiency, security, data integrity, and care continuity of medical institutions. The combination of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence technology holds great potential. It can transform fragmented health data into portable and interoperable records under patient control, thus bringing strategic advantages to the health system that is undergoing a comprehensive digital transformation.},

  abstract = {Prompt and sufficient feedback is essential for students' academic learning since it enables them to review their learning techniques and improve their areas of weakness. Nevertheless, delivering personalised feedback to every student continues to be difficult&nbsp;for teachers due to its demanding and time-intensive nature. While automated feedback systems are available, their primary focus is providing feedback on a single subject, and most of them utilise statistical analysis or traditional machine learning techniques to provide feedback. Moreover, no feedback model utilises the same criteria to generate text-based feedback for more than one subject. Generative artificial intelligence (GEN AI) has recently made incredible progress, and large language models (LLMs) can retain the context from the vast amount of text. Hence, this research presents a framework that employs an innovative technique to offer text-based feedback to students in different fields of study. This framework employs two LLMs, one for generating the feedback and another for categorising it into separate subjects using suitable headings for structural organising. Consequently, the output produced by this technology corresponds to the original tone of the teacher.},

In this study, we explore the accessibility and usability of the interfaces of four popular AI-based tools via screen readers through a combination of semi-automated evaluations and inspections conducted by both sighted and blind accessibility experts and screen readers with more than 20 years of experience. Navigation, labeling of control elements, feedback mechanisms, and prompt handling were considered in the study. The results point to usability difficulties in all tools, particularly in navigation structure, clarity of feedback and interactive elements. Although this work empirically explores the accessibility of AI-based tools it brings out the first critical issues that deserve further investigation. However, they are based on a small group of experts and thus should be considered preliminary and useful for future studies.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet and the exponential growth of network information resources, how to help users quickly obtain valuable information has become a major challenge. As the key technology of this problem, recommendation algorithm has become an important tool in the information age. However, most existing recommendation systems, such as traditional deep learning recommendation algorithms, still have problems such as cold start of new users and improper handling of dynamic changes in user behavior. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a fusion Group behavior characteristics and time series characteristics of the recommendation algorithm model Group-Temporal Recommendation Fusion (GTRF). Based on deep learning algorithm, the model extracts group behavioral characteristics by using graph attention network to deal with the problem of cold start, obtains time series characteristics by using gated convolution and GRU to deal with the problem of dynamic changes in user behavior, and finally uses cross-attention mechanism to effectively integrate these two types of features to achieve high-precision prediction of recommended content. GTRF not only solves the problems such as cold start of new users and dynamic change of user behavior, but also significantly improves the comprehensive performance of recommendation algorithm, showing the indispensable and great potential of recommendation algorithm in information retrieval.},

Through comparative analysis, this paper highlights the advantages and limitations of current detection methods and outlines potential research directions for the future.

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence extends beyond its success in image/text synthesis, proving itself a powerful uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique through its capability to sample from complex high-dimensional probability distributions. However, existing methods often require a complicated training process, which greatly hinders their applications to real-world UQ problems, especially in dynamic UQ tasks where the target probability distribution evolves rapidly with time. To alleviate this challenge, we have developed a scalable, training-free score-based diffusion model for high-dimensional sampling. We incorporate a parallel-in-time method into our diffusion model to use a large number of GPUs to solve the backward stochastic differential equation and generate new samples of the target distribution. Moreover, we also distribute the computation of the large matrix subtraction used by the training-free score estimator onto multiple GPUs available across all nodes. Compared to existing methods, our approach completely avoids training the score function, making it capable of adapting to rapid changes in the target probability distribution. We showcase the remarkable strong and weak scaling capabilities of the proposed method on the Frontier supercomputer, as well as its uncertainty reduction capability in hurricane predictions when coupled with AI-based foundation models.},

Despite growing interests in investigating this phenomenon, there is little conceptual clarity or consistency regarding what actually constitutes a "gender stereotype" in AI. Therefore, it is critical to provide a more comprehensive image of existing understandings and ongoing discussions of gender stereotypes of AI to guide AI design that reduces the harmful effects of these stereotypes. In doing so, this paper presents a scoping review of over 20 years of research across HCI, HRI and various social science disciplines on how gender stereotypes are applied to AI. We outline the methods and contexts of this growing body of work, develop a typology to clarify these stereotypes, highlight under-explored approaches for future research, and offer guidelines to improve rigor and consistency in this field that may inform responsible AI design in the future.},

On the basis of existing scholars' influence evaluation algorithms at home and abroad, this article designs a scholar influence evaluation approach and algorithm based on open peer review. That is, the qualitative content of open peer review in scholar articles is processed by certain artificial intelligence technology to form multiple label sets that can represent the influence of scholars from different dimensions, thus exploring the multi angle evaluation of scholar influence from a quality perspective. Finally, this article conducts empirical research and comparative analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using the open peer review platform F1000 as the data source platform. Empirical research has shown that the algorithm proposed in this article provides a new perspective and approach for evaluating the influence of scholars, which can preliminarily achieve multidimensional evaluation of scholars, endow scholars with personal academic profiles, and enhance the fullness and recognition of scholar influence. Comparative analysis shows that this algorithm does not have a significant correlation with bibliometric evaluation algorithms and can serve as a supplement to the existing evaluation system. The combination of traditional bibliometric analysis algorithms and open peer review based algorithms will be the future development trend of academic evaluation.},

  abstract = {The study builds an AI support framework based on Tomlinson's theory, and achieves accurate learning diagnosis through five-dimensional data (cognitive, behavioural, emotional, environmental and social). Practice has proven that AI can dynamically optimise teaching. However, there are challenges in AI application: over-reliance on technology undermines teacher-student interaction, algorithmic bias exacerbates educational injustice, and data privacy risks need to be regulated. The study emphasises that AI in education should be based on the essence of “educating people”, and promote the role of teachers to shift from “knowledge transfer” to “growth guidance” under the ethical framework, and synergise technological empowerment and humanistic care. The future needs to explore localised adaptation paths. In the future, it is necessary to explore the local adaptation path, not only to make use of AI to break through the bottleneck of large-scale education but also to prevent the alienation of the technology, and build an intelligent education ecology of “teaching in accordance with one's aptitude”.},

  abstract = {In the field of data privacy protection, data access is restricted by setting access privileges and authentication mechanisms. However, when data usage scenarios or access requirements change, the privilege settings need to be adjusted frequently, resulting in complex and inefficient management. Especially when dealing with large-scale distributed data, traditional methods are difficult to efficiently screen and eliminate malicious behavior clients, which further aggravates the risk of privacy leakage. Therefore, we study the optimization of data privacy protection algorithm based on distributed artificial intelligence technology. The key feature information is extracted to reflect the essential attributes of the data, in order to simplify the form of data representation. The federal learning algorithm in distributed artificial intelligence technology is used for data protection to efficiently screen and eliminate potential malicious clients. On this basis, we add appropriate amount of noise to the query process to protect the data from being leaked, and at the same time, dynamically adjust the data privacy protection algorithm and update the protection scheme in real time to cope with the changing nature of the data and its intrinsic relevance. The experimental results show that the optimization method of data privacy protection algorithm based on distributed artificial intelligence technology is significantly better than other comparative methods in reducing the possibility of privacy leakage, improving privacy protection efficiency, and reducing data loss rate. Moreover, the security and reliability of privacy data is as high as 90\%, fully verifying the superiority of the proposed method. The results indicate that this method provides an efficient, stable, and secure technical means for data privacy protection.},

  abstract = {As DDoS attack patterns become increasingly varied and challenging to detect with the advancement of the field, this paper aims to explore the possibilities of applying machine learning algorithms for the defense and detection of DDoS attacks. We selected papers published since 2000 concerning the aforementioned applications, investigated the algorithms described therein, and compared their data performance in the testing sections to explore the advantages and disadvantages. Our findings reveal that SVM exhibits excellent performance in detecting attack traffic, whereas decision trees and their enhanced versions are less prominent. Additionally, genetic algorithms are not suitable for attack traffic detection but excel in filtering irrelevant traffic features. These insights hold significant implications for both real-world applications in enhancing cybersecurity measures and theoretical contributions by laying groundwork for future research in the rapidly evolving domain of DDoS attack mitigation. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive overview of the landscape of machine learning in DDoS defense, providing valuable insights and directions for future investigations.},

  abstract = {With the continuous expansion of urban building volume and the significant increase of operational complexity, the monitoring of the health status of building structures has become a key means to ensure urban safety and sustainable operation of buildings. This paper focuses on the integration and application of artificial intelligence and digital twin technology in building structural health monitoring, and systematically constructs an intelligent monitoring system architecture driven by multi-source sensing data, with AI model as the core and digital twin platform as the carrier. Through the design of multi-dimensional sensing network, the dynamic perception of stress, vibration, displacement and other behaviors of key building components is realized; combined with AI models such as convolutional neural network (CNN), graphical neural network (GNN), and long and short-term memory network (LSTM), the ability of structural state identification, damage prediction and trend modeling is enhanced; and three-dimensional visualization and interactive display of the structural state of health is realized by relying on the BIM platform. The article selects a number of typical engineering scenarios such as high-rise steel structure buildings, underground hubs, and protective buildings to carry out experiments and case studies, and verifies the significant advantages of the AI-driven digital twin system in terms of real-time, accuracy, and adaptability.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the bias effect in the application of artificial intelligence in China and its impact on the employment structure of the labor force. Using statistical analysis and modeling methods, the study analyzes the relevant data of China's labor market from 2013 to 2023.The study first defines the elasticity of substitution, the technology bias index and the labor allocation bias index and, on this basis, builds a model to calculate the three indices.The calculation results show that from 2013 to 2023, the factor allocation bias effect in China's labor market favors low-end labor; the technology bias effect between low-end and mid-end labor favors mid-end labor; and the bias effect between low-end and mid-end labor inhibits the employment of low-end labor. The initial phenomenon of polarization began to appear in China's labor market.Next, the study conducted a correlation analysis and found that the size of AI applications is negatively correlated with the employment of the low-end and mid-end labor force and positively correlated with the employment of the high-end labor force. This implies that the expansion of AI applications in China has helped to promote the employment of the high-end labor force, but has been detrimental to the employment of the mid- and low-end labor force, especially the mid-end labor force.Finally, based on the findings of the study, the following countermeasures are proposed: deepen the degree of human-machine synergy, realize two-way empowerment of human-machine; improve the quality of higher education, strengthen the training of employment skills, improve the mechanism of employment security, and improve the social security system.},

The research now investigates the psychological traits across a diverse array of disabled athletes, including those in both high-intensity and precision sports, broadening our understanding and applicability of the AI-driven psychological model, and examines how these traits differ from those of able-bodied individuals. The study proposes an emotional psychological model based on AI, which simulates the generation and fluctuation of emotions using a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. By simulating emotional states in response to external stimuli, the model aims to achieve emotional balance and stability, crucial for the mental well-being of athletes. The results suggest that AI can play a significant role in understanding and improving the psychological conditions of disabled athletes, ultimately enhancing their performance and quality of life. The research provides valuable theoretical insights and practical implications for integrating AI into the psychological training and support of disabled athletes.},

  abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence technology, generative AI models such as GPT are now increasingly used in education. Studies have found that these models have great potential in improving students' innovation ability, especially in cultivating students' creative thinking and problem-solving abilities. However, we found that the current traditional teaching methods are still somewhat lacking in cultivating students' innovation and creativity. For example, many students are not well prepared and answer questions when facing complex real-life problems. This time, our research mainly wants to see whether the tasks designed based on GPT can effectively improve undergraduate students' creativity. At the same time, we use the support vector machine (SVM) model for quantitative evaluation. We designed four specific tasks to examine students' performance from the core dimensions of innovation, namely creative thinking, problem solving, knowledge integration, and teamwork. The experimental results show that GPT has a significant effect on improving students' creative thinking (task one) and problem solving (task two), especially in the problem-solving task. We also compared the scores predicted by the model with the actual scores and found that the two were very consistent, which shows that GPT can indeed help students better diverge their thinking and analyze problems. In addition, this study also verified the feasibility of using support vector machines to quantitatively evaluate students' innovation ability. In general, GPT combined with machine learning models such as SVM may become a valuable tool in the future in improving students' creativity, problem-solving ability, and even overall innovation performance.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) models have reached a very significant level of accuracy. While their superior performance offers considerable benefits, their inherent complexity often decreases human trust, which slows their application in high-risk decision-making domains, such as finance. The field of explainable AI (XAI) seeks to bridge this gap, aiming to make AI models more understandable. This survey, focusing on published work from 2018 to 2024, categorizes XAI approaches that predict financial time series. In this article, explainability and interpretability are distinguished, emphasizing the need to treat these concepts separately, as they are not applied the same way in practice. Through clear definitions, a rigorous taxonomy of XAI approaches, a complementary characterization, and examples of XAI’s application in the finance industry, this article provides a comprehensive view of XAI’s current role in finance. It can also serve as a guide for selecting the most appropriate XAI approach for future applications.},

  abstract = {Clinical diagnosis has become easier because of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since detailed images of soft tissues are possible. While having its own advantages MRI has multiple limitations. MRI machines are generally expensive, and extended scan time can (over)burden clinical healthcare systems at the expense of medical work efficiency. The rise of deep learning technologies has spurred the development of methods to accelerate MRI reconstruction. In this regard, we introduce a novel cold-diffusion-based approach to accelerate MRI reconstruction. This method leverages the Swin Transformer architecture for effective feature extraction and incorporates a high-frequency self-attention mechanism to improve the recovery of high-frequency components, thus enhancing image quality. Unlike traditional diffusion models that rely on Gaussian noise, our cold-diffusion model simulates data loss through specific degradation processes like Cartesian undersampling. Experimental results demonstrate that the Swin-CDMR approach outperforms existing techniques in reconstruction quality, achieving superior structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores while maintaining robustness across varying acceleration factors (AF).},

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) helps to explain why black-box models produce specific predictions. This paper systematically reviews the past five years of research on XAI applications for interpreting student performance prediction in Computer Science and STEM education. We found that behavioral and academic performance data were the most commonly used features, with the main prediction goals focused on course failure risk or grades. This study also examined the application areas of XAI, revealing that the most common uses were global feature importance analysis, individual prediction explanations, and supporting interventions and decision-making. Moreover, we found that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were the most frequently utilized XAI technique, predominantly applied at the global level, with limited use at the individual level. Furthermore, a research gap was identified in utilizing XAI to support course improvements, customize visualizations, and generate personalized recommendations. Addressing this gap could enable educators to provide personalized, data-driven guidance to better support individual students.},

  abstract = {Modern AI systems are man-made objects that leverage machine learning to support our lives across a myriad of contexts and applications. Despite extensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations remain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI systems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions—their metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this perspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We do so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria—formal rules that answer the questions “When are two AI systems the same?” and “When does an AI system persist, despite change?” Building on Carrara and Vermaas’ account of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness provides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of these artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical make-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their trustworthiness profiles—the collection of capabilities that the systems must uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their effectiveness in maintaining these capabilities. Our approach suggests that the identity and persistence of AI systems is sensitive to the socio-technical context of their design and utilization via their trustworthiness, providing a solid metaphysical foundation to the epistemological, ethical, and legal discussions about these artifacts.},

Research shows that the research direction has shifted from the application of technological tools to educational ethics and the essence of talent cultivation. Based on these findings, the study puts forward development suggestions from three dimensions. The three dimensions are respectively building a cross-disciplinary collaboration mechanism, strengthening technology-driven innovation, and enhancing the digital literacy of teachers and students.

  abstract = {University students' adoption of generative AI tools in educational contexts is investigated in this research through two complementary studies. A Jordanian-based cross-sectional study (N=95) initially established the middle students' familiarity (M=3.14, SD=0.81) with generative AI writing tools, along with significant concerns about misinformation/data security (M=3.35, SD=0.85), but high awareness regarding advantages for creativity simulation and innovation facilitation (M=3.62, SD=0.81). Second, a Chinese UTAUT-based research (N=361) employing SEM-ANN hybrid analysis found that DeepSeek adoption intention is significantly determined by Perceived Price (β=0.346), Performance Expectancy (β=0.244), Effort Expectancy (β=0.233), eXplainable AI (β=0.126), and Facilitating Conditions (β=0.084), while Social Influence did not appear to be significant (β=−0.019). Moderator analysis found gender and education level to significantly moderate some predictor-intention relationships. Synthetically, these findings demonstrate: (a) cultural consensus in recognition of AI's value for learning in various capacities despite technical challenges, (b) the critical role of cost disclosure, usability, and explainability in adoption, and (c) stratified intervention needs to address technical instruction, ethical literacy, cost reduction, and maximization of usability – particularly through personalized learning deployments. The study supports the UTAUT's efficacy for use in AI adoption studies while enriching methodology integration through SEM-ANN methods.},

Text-to-Image (T2I) software, one of the most widely used, synthesizes images with text input by engaging in a cross-modal process. However, despite substantial advancements in the T2I engine, T2I software still encounters errors when generating complex or non-realistic scenes, including omitting focal entities, low image realism, and mismatched text-image information. The cross-modal nature of T2I software complicates error detection for traditional testing methods, and the absence of test oracles further exacerbates the complexity of the testing process. To fill this gap, we propose ACTesting, an Automated Cross-modal Testing Method of Text-to-Image Software, the first testing method explicitly designed for T2I software. ACTesting utilizes the metamorphic testing principle to address the oracle problem and identifies cross-modal semantic consistency as its fundamental Metamorphic relation (MR) by employing the Entity-relationship (ER) triples. We design three kinds of mutation operators under the guidance of MR and the adaptability density constraint to construct the new input text. After generating the images based on the text, ACTesting verifies whether MR is satisfied by detecting the ER triples across two modalities to detect the errors of T2I software. In our experiments across five popular T2I software, ACTesting effectively generates error-revealing tests, resulting in a decrease in text-image consistency by up to 20\% when compared to the baseline. Additionally, an ablation study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed mutation operators. The experimental results validate that ACTesting can reliably identify errors within T2I software.},

  abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) offers promising opportunities for procedural learning, particularly in preserving intangible cultural heritage. Advances in generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) further enrich these experiences by enabling adaptive learning pathways. However, evaluating such adaptive systems using traditional temporal metrics remains challenging due to the inherent variability in Gen-AI response times. To address this, our study employs multimodal behavioural metrics, including visual attention, physical exploratory behaviour, and verbal interaction, to assess user engagement in an adaptive VR environment. In a controlled experiment with (n = 54) participants, we compared three levels of adaptivity (high, moderate, and non-adaptive baseline) within a Neapolitan pizza-making VR experience. Results show that moderate adaptivity optimally enhances user engagement, significantly reducing unnecessary exploratory behaviour and increasing focused visual attention on the AI avatar. Our findings suggest that a balanced level of adaptive AI provides the most effective user support, offering practical design recommendations for future adaptive educational technologies.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has led the AI community to speculate that artificial superintelligence (ASI) may be within reach, particularly if an AI system can iteratively search for solutions, learn from results, and leverage improved knowledge for more searches. In this context, this study explores the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into Building Information Modeling (BIM) by focusing on the four key pillars of the OpenAI o1 model and their ethical implications. Through comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we examine these pillars—policy initialization, reward design, search strategies, and learning mechanisms—and their application in BIM-GenAI within a continuous improvement cycle. Results demonstrate that policy initialization generates human-like reasoning behaviors and domain-specific knowledge for BIM tasks. Reward design, central to reinforcement learning, optimizes BIM objectives through measurable metrics and learned evaluation methods. Search strategies prove valuable for exploring complex design spaces and generating high-quality BIM solutions, while learning mechanisms, including policy gradient and behavior cloning, enable continuous model improvement through feedback. The study emphasizes the importance of establishing BIM-AI protocols, maintaining human expertise in decision-making, and balancing automation with human input. Our findings suggest that while GenAI, powered by reinforcement learning, offers significant potential for enhancing BIM capabilities, three critical ethical considerations—data privacy and security, algorithmic bias mitigation, and transparency and accountability—must guide responsible implementation. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI in construction technologies and provides a foundation for the ethical advancement of BIM-GenAI systems using OpenAI o1.},

While previous research has explored the pedagogical applications of GenAI and the challenges faced by educators and students, there is less focus on GenAI in the context of a design education. We present findings from group interviews and a survey study conducted with interaction design bachelor students, foregrounding the attitudes and perspectives of students who are motivated to learn. We show that although students are generally aware of ethical issues surrounding GenAI, they make considered decisions on how they use it to support their learning. An insight is how the students’ pride in their own learning and accomplishment guides their use more than moralistic and disciplinary rhetoric widespread in the higher education sector. The paper concludes with thought-provoking questions to guide future steps. The insights presented may inform curriculum development and suggest future research directions on the role of AI-assisted learning in HCI education.},

  abstract = {The rising levels of stress and anxiety among university students have become increasingly alarming, largely driven by academic pressures, social expectations, and the transition to adulthood. These challenges often result in a decline in mental well-being, necessitating innovative solutions to help ease the burden. This paper presents the design and development process of Purry, a social robot inspired by cat behaviors, created to provide stress relief for university students. Purry was designed to offer emotional comfort in a unique way, harnessing the calming effects of pet-like interactions. The design process focused on achieving both aesthetic appeal and functional efficiency, combining modern and traditional technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and low-cost materials, following the double diamond methodology. The robot mimics feline behaviors like kneading and purring, exploring both active and passive tactile interactions, which have been shown to reduce stress through sensory stimulation. Iterative development cycles, guided by user feedback, led to significant advancements in balancing form and function. The final result is a robotic experience that combines emotional support with innovative design, offering a product that not only addresses students' mental health needs but also fosters an engaging and comforting presence in their environment.},

  abstract = {With the development of tools using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to create art, stakeholders cannot come to an agreement on the value of these works. In this study we uncovered the mixed opinions surrounding art made by AI.We developed two versions of a dance performance augmented by technology either with or without GenAI. For each version we informed audiences of how the performance was developed either before or after they had taken a survey on their perceptions of the performance. There were thirty-nine participants (13 males, 26 female) recruited and divided between the four performances. After the survey, we conducted focus groups with a subset of audience members. Results demonstrated that individuals were more inclined to attribute artistic merit to works made by GenAI when they were unaware its use. Our work contributes to the understanding of the design and reception of AI-made art.},

  abstract = {Filigree art, which represents typical intricate metalwork, has been captivating audiences worldwide with its delicate lace-like patterns and interwoven metal wires’ refined aesthetics. Particularly, Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage filigree craftsmanship has a unique aesthetic value in fine patterns and complex three-dimensional shapes. However, designing and creating filigree artworks is a labor-intensive and technically complex task and often requires extensive training and a deep understanding of the craft, which limits its design aesthetic and cultural continuity. Aiming to overcome these challenges, this study proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) -aided method that uses AI-generated content (AIGC) technology to accelerate the visualization process of this time-consuming and intricate craft by investigating the role of AI in craft design. First, a comprehensive study of filigree art culture is conducted to identify more than ten historic filigree techniques to obtain AI opportunities. Then, an AI-powered framework called AIFiligree is developed by optimizing culture-based labels and training parameters, enabling the generation of highly authentic fine filigree structures. Further, user workflows are introduced to support diverse design scenarios. Through user studies involving 22 filigree experts and 16 designers, we finally gained insights into AI’s opportunities and challenges in cultural learning, expression, and design.},

However, DETR still faces low detection accuracy and efficiency problems when dealing with small objects and complex backgrounds. In order to enhance the performance of DETR in aircraft detection, this paper proposes an aircraft detection method based on an improved DETR architecture, which mainly consists of two innovative improvements: first, an ECA attention mechanism is introduced after CNN feature extraction to enhance the model's adaptive learning ability for important features; second, Swin Transformer is used to replace the encoder in the original DETR -decoder structure in the original DETR, using its local windowing self-attention mechanism to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of the model. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper improves the detection accuracy and speed compared with the traditional DETR in the aircraft detection task, especially in the complex background with better robustness and generalization ability. The research in this paper provides an effective improvement idea for the Transformer-based target detection method and provides new technical support for high-precision target detection tasks in practical applications.},

High-income groups clearly occupy an advantageous position in the access and application of artificial intelligence technology. Their access frequency, application depth and technology dependence are far greater than those of low-income groups. Data analysis shows that there are significant differences in the adoption and application of artificial intelligence technology among social classes. Groups with weak economic foundations face the difficulties of lack of education and resources, and face a large technical threshold for technology access.

Alt text is indispensable for visually impaired individuals to understand visual content through assistive technologies. Nonetheless, the manual generation of high-quality alt text at scale continues to pose a considerable difficulty because of the requisite skill and time involved.This paper introduces AltGen, a framework utilizing generative AI to automate the development of alt text for EPUB files. AltGen uses pre-trained transformer models to provide descriptive and contextually pertinent alt text. It employs a structured process encompassing data extraction, visual content analysis with computer vision models (e.g., CLIP, ViT), and context-sensitive text generation utilizing fine-tuned large language models. The produced alt-text is assessed by computational measures, including cosine similarity and BLEU scores, and qualitative input from visually challenged individuals. Experimental findings demonstrate that AltGen lowers accessibility errors by 97.5\%, with participants noting substantial enhancements in content understanding and usability.},

These innovations promise more improved diagnoses and time-saving cost-effectiveness. However, GenAI’s rapid implementation poses significant challenges for meeting regulatory, ethical, and trustworthiness standards. These challenges include data privacy issues, reproducibility concerns, algorithmic bias in training data causing disparities in outcomes, and a lack of transparency and explainability. Unresolved, these issues could negatively affect the public’s confidence in and perception of GenAI systems. Addressing these challenges, international AI governance frameworks, including the EU AI Act and WHO guidelines, prioritize regulatory adherence, trustworthiness, and the explainability of healthcare AI systems. While such frameworks have expanded, a deficiency remains in translating policy into effective compliance mechanisms. We propose a Compliance Agentic Model (CAM) framework to help organizations comply with GenAI and machine learning (ML)-based solutions. The CAM framework establishes trustworthiness in GenAI applications used in healthcare, ensuring alignment with organizational values and ethical standards to enhance accountability and regulatory adherence.},

  abstract = {With the continuous development of blockchain technology, an increasing number of scholars have begun to consider the harm of data leakage during on-chain transactions and the requirement for privacy data protection. Zero-knowledge range proof, as a cryptographic technology, can perform legitimacy verification of data while hiding private data, effectively realizing the protection of private data on the blockchain, so it is increasingly used to protect blockchain privacy. The mainstream construction methods for range proofs can be mainly divided into two categories: n-ary decomposition and square decomposition. This paper introduces and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of these construction methods in detail. Then, based on these two methods, a zero-knowledge range proof scheme based on multibit split square decomposition (ZKRPMSSD) is proposed, which requires no trusted third-party setting and can achieve range proofs for arbitrary ranges. The proposed ZKRPMSSD scheme processes the original data based on the multibit split idea, and the acquisition method of secret value components is optimized so that the acquisition of components does not depend on the scale of the original problem. Additionally, the algorithms for proof generation and verification in the ZKRPMSSD scheme are redesigned based on the (Sigma ) protocol and Pedersen commitments, effectively reducing the computational cost of the proof generation and verification process. Finally, typical n-ary decomposition and square decomposition zero-knowledge range proof construction schemes are taken for comparative analysis. Under 256-bit security and the same problem scale, experimental results indicate that ZKRPMSSD has advantages in proof and verification time costs.},

This paper proposes the Emotion-Art Prompt Framework (EAPF) which provides a systematic link between Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions and L\"{o}vheim's three-dimensional model with basic underlying elements of art — form, color, light/shadow, and composition to facilitate drawing generation in an AI setting. This paper describes a new system architecture that autonomously maps layered emotional descriptors onto structured prompts interfacing with the Tencent Yuanbao AI drawing platform. Through a large-scale experiment involving more than 800 students (aged 10–12) in Shenzhen (China), we assessed quantitative and qualitative data embedded in emotional alignment, creative engagement, and platform suitability. Our findings show that EAPF substantially improves the emotional expressiveness of AI-generated works of art, while offering data-based insights for educators to tailor art teaching to individual student preferences. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of well-designed prompt engineering to overcome accessibility barriers in traditional art education while enhancing emotional development. Additionally, it proposes a scalable model for integrating AI technologies into K–12 creative learning.},

  abstract = {The deep learning model LSTM (Long Short - Term Memory) can be used to deal with the problem of sequences, and is currently the most commonly used model to deal with music training. The process of LSTM training is sequence-to-sequence, which allows the back-and-forth relationship of notes in an instrument to be learnt by the model; however, when dealing with multiple instruments, there are multiple sequences that need to be processed at the same time, which is a limitation of the LSTM model architecture, which makes most of the current automated composition systems for single instrument training and output. However, when dealing with multiple instruments, there are multiple sequences that need to be processed at the same time, which is a limitation of the LSTM model architecture, and this makes most of the current automated composers train and output for a single instrument. Currently it is visible to deal with LSTM multiple sequences problem. Whereas this study needs to achieve multiple sound event sequence inputs corresponding to multiple sequence outputs, and the sequences are connected to each other, a problem for which there is no effective solution at present. This study attempts to choose to use Deep Improvisation (Tatsuya, 2017) for improvement by training a single track and optimizing and modifying the system to be able to have two tracks of input and two tracks of output to achieve a more resilient system, which in turn creates more realistic music. Due to the above background, the motivation to improve the deep learning automatic songwriting system arises with the expectation that the research in this paper will improve the system to be able to produce multi-tracked and more realistic music, so that more researchers will be able to apply the system to be able to produce songs and apply them to a variety of contexts at a small cost.},

With the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI), there is a unique opportunity for scalable and adaptable creation of learning media. However, with novel technology, there also come new challenges. Thus, we developed fine-tuned AI-generated podcasts using Google NotebookLM, our course materials, and a custom prompt. We conducted a one-month explorative evaluation in the field using a qualitative diary study. Our study reveals that students find the podcasts beneficial for flexible everyday learning but also point toward challenges like a lack of emotional engagement and technical non-English language issues. In sum, our study highlights the current benefits and challenges of AI-generated podcasts and presents an agenda for future research.},

  year = {2025},
  publisher = {AAAI Press},
  abstract = {Observers and practitioners of artificial intelligence (AI) have proposed an FDA-style licensing regime for the most advanced AI models, or 'frontier' models. In this paper, we explore the applicability of approval regulation - that is, regulation of a product that combines experimental minima with government licensure conditioned partially or fully upon that experimentation - to the regulation of frontier AI. There are a number of reasons to believe that approval regulation, simplistically applied, would be inapposite for frontier AI risks. Domains of weak fit include the difficulty of defining the regulated product, the presence of Knightian uncertainty or deep ambiguity about harms from AI, the potentially transmissible nature of risks, and distributed activities among actors involved in the AI lifecycle. We conclude by highlighting the role of policy learning and experimentation in regulatory development, describing how learning from other forms of AI regulation and improvements in evaluation and testing methods can help to overcome some of the challenges we identify.},

  abstract = {Crime prediction serves as a fundamental basis for preventing crime, maintaining social stability, and ensuring public safety. Current crime prediction models commonly suffer from issues such as low accuracy, unstable predictions, or weak generalization capabilities. Therefore, we constructed an improved LSTM crime prediction model based on environmental factors, integrated the data of various environmental factors such as economy, culture and climate, improved the LSTM network structure and optimization method, and enhanced the prediction ability of crime in the region. Empirical evidence shows that the MAPE predicted by the model is 0.0491 and R2 is 0.9229. Compared with the traditional model, the accuracy, stability and generalization ability of the prediction are significantly improved, which can provide a basis for the formulation of crime prevention and control strategies, improve the level of social security management, and promote social stability.},

  abstract = {This study systematically evaluates the technological realization path and social benefits of generative artificial intelligence (AIGC) in multilingual teaching and learning in higher education.  Based on current advanced multilingual model architectures and cross-modal content generation technologies, an automatic generation system for teaching resources supporting 12 languages is constructed.  Experimental data showed that the system led to a 41.2\% increase in learning efficiency in a Tamil course at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) (p&lt;0.01, n=320), while a test of teaching Chinese as a second language at the Beijing Language and Culture University (BLCU) showed that AIGC-generated personalized exercises reduced the learner error rate by 33.7\%.  The study further revealed that (i) the cost of generating instructional materials for low-resource languages (e.g., Kiswahili) decreased to 18.5\% of the traditional approach;  and (ii) through an authoritative equity assessment framework, it was confirmed that the technological solution could narrow the digital education divide between developing and developed countries by up to 27.3 percentage points.  This provides actionable technological support for the equity goals of the UN's Education 2030 Agenda.},

However, sentiment information of financial texts requires a lot of domain expert knowledge, and manual retrieval is expensive. In this paper, we propose the application of an evolutionary generative model for sentiment retrieval of financial information based on interactive genetic algorithms from the perspective of user implicit modeling. The uncertain preference estimation of evolutionary individuals is realized. The user preference model is adjusted according to the uncertainty evaluation, and the user preference is dynamically tracked to obtain the fitness value of the evolutionary individual for evolutionary optimization. The experimental results show that the proposed method can implicitly perceive user preferences, reduce user explicit evaluation, reduce user fatigue, and improve the search performance of the algorithm.},

These are the fundamental issues around originality, transformative use, and fair use for AI that will need to be taken into account to meet IP law. It also tests model performance metrics — accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score — as a function of legality and proof-based reliability. True positives, bias, and data privacy are discussed from legal perspectives as well as impacts to individuals and companies, as well as regulatory requirements such as GDPR and CCPA. The future of the sector lies in morally better model training, data selection and privacy protection. Findings indicate that AI provides promising IP protection, but risk management is essential to ensure legal, moral application in IP enforcement.},

  abstract = {Generative AI is transforming the educational landscape, raising significant concerns about cheating. Despite the widespread use of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in assessments, the detection of AI cheating in MCQ-based tests has been almost unexplored, in contrast to the focus on detecting AI-cheating on text-rich student outputs. In this paper, we propose a method based on the application of Item Response Theory (IRT) to address this gap. Our approach operates on the assumption that artificial and human intelligence exhibit different response patterns, with AI cheating manifesting as deviations from the expected patterns of human responses. These deviations are modeled using Person-Fit Statistics (PFS). We demonstrate that this method effectively highlights the differences between human responses and those generated by premium versions of leading chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini), but that it is also sensitive to the amount of AI cheating in the data. Furthermore, we show that the chatbots differ in their reasoning profiles. Our work provides both a theoretical foundation and empirical evidence for the application of IRT to identify AI cheating in MCQ-based assessments.},

It puts forward a journey from March 2023 to January 2025; the researcher (as artist/artist as a researcher) examines how generative artificial intelligence tools, including ChatGPT and MidJourney, reignited a passion for looser (imperfect) art practice. This process led to self-scrutiny through self-portrait that bridges personal and research. While generative artificial intelligence ignited creativity, it brought authenticity, originality, and tensions with ethics. These concerns are addressed through themes such as attribution transparency, the ethics of relying on non-human solutions and balancing inspiration versus imitation. The pictorial shares extracts from a two-year digital sketchbook that reflects how GAI can support artists in times of crisis and contributes to broader conversations about GAI's role in art practice. It invites readers to consider the evolving relationship between artists and GAI in shaping the future of art practice.},

It identifies a broad range of AI metaphors in the wider culture and technical literature and discusses metaphor design in terms of explanation, persuasion and speculation. To explore different metaphor design strategies, we use a custom GPT to generate a large number of variants on the “artificial intelligence” metaphor.  The paper contributes a conceptual framing for such speculative metaphor drawing on ideas of knowledge and understanding, fusion and synthesis, collaboration and collectives. We argue that generating speculative metaphors provides a means of thinking critically about human-AI interaction.},

Implementing AI models at scale and ensuring cost-effective production of AI-based technologies through entirely in-house capabilities is a challenge. The success of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) Cloud Computing models can be leveraged to facilitate a cost-effective and scalable AI service paradigm, namely, “AI as a Service” (AIaaS). We summarize current state-of-the-art solutions for AIaaS, and we discuss its prospects for growth and opportunities to advance the concept. To this end, we perform a thorough review of recent research on AI and various deployment strategies for emerging domains considering both technical as well as survey articles. Next, we identify various characteristics and capabilities that need to be met before an AIaaS model can be successfully designed and deployed. Based on this, we present a general framework of an AIaaS architecture that integrates the required aaS characteristics with the capabilities of AI. We also compare various approaches for offering AIaaS to end users. Finally, we illustrate several real-world use cases for AIaaS models, followed by a discussion of some of the challenges that must be addressed to enable AIaaS adoption.},

The number of overseas students is one of critical indexes to evaluate the internationalization of higher education. However, with the increasing proportion of overseas students, how to balance the contradiction between personalized and generalized education has become the focus of current curriculum teaching reform. This study selects Jinan University, the highest institution for overseas Chinese in China, as the research location, and treats the C language course for electrical engineering and automation major as a case. The differences in learning foundation and training targets between mainland and overseas students are discussed. Furthermore, a six-step teaching reform framework using artificial intelligence technology is proposed. It not only comprehensively analyzes the key points in teaching, but also uses artificial intelligence technology to compensate the difficulty in meeting students' personalized needs in large courses, which may provide reference for educators and lecturers.},

  abstract = {A study aims to establish a relationship between artificial intelligence-based systems by integrating the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for psychological modeling and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for error recognition. This review paper combines current developments in AI technology with recurrent neural networks (RNN) to study psychological aspects that impact tennis training strategy development. Study examined six studies from 2022 to 2024 by following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for systematic assessment. The selected findings assess AI-controlled psychological regulation alongside error action recognition and introduce improvements for online teaching and electronic line judging and automated ball transmitter path analysis and ball-passing net tracking systems. The research demonstrates that implementing RNNs optimized through AI systems produces better psychological state predictions that achieve 73\% successful intervention outcomes. Big data analytics improve online tennis education while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate 95.34\% success in error action recognition. The controversy about AI taking over human line judges persists because it raises technical advantages but also ethical considerations. The review demonstrates how AI offers substantial training transformations in tennis but shows unexplored research opportunities for the future.},

  abstract = {With the development of the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education, countries and international organizations have introduced relevant policies to address the opportunities and challenges it brings to education. A thorough analysis of these policies on a global scale is important for guiding educational innovation and ensuring the effectiveness of technology applications. This article uses a content analysis method, taking 26 artificial intelligence education policies from major countries and international organizations as samples, and employs a "policy tool—policy content" two-dimensional analysis framework to quantitatively analyze the policy texts to reveal the characteristics of international artificial intelligence education policies. The study finds that the current types of policy tools are mainly supply-oriented and environmental-oriented, focusing more on dimensions such as quality assessment and assurance, resource environment construction, and future talent cultivation in terms of content elements. Supply-side tools provide resource support for the construction of intelligent educational environments and innovative cultivation services for the improvement of teachers' and students' intelligent literacy; environmental tools build institutional standards for the quality assurance of intelligent education and create organizational strategies to achieve inclusive and fair education. Finally, the study proposes suggestions for the formulation and optimization of artificial intelligence education policies from four aspects: strengthening talent cultivation, focusing on independent research and development, deepening international exchanges, and systematic policy design, to promote the high-quality development of teaching and education in the digital age.},

Software engineering, as an increasingly complex process to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain large-scale software systems for solving real-world challenges, is profoundly affected by many revolutionary artificial intelligence tools in general and machine learning in particular. In this roadmap for artificial intelligence in software engineering, we highlight the recent deep impact of artificial intelligence on software engineering by discussing successful stories of applications of artificial intelligence to classic and new software development challenges. We identify the new challenges that the software engineering community has to address in the coming years to successfully apply artificial intelligence in software engineering, and we share our research roadmap toward the effective use of artificial intelligence in the software engineering profession, while still protecting fundamental human values.We spotlight three main areas that challenge the research in software engineering: the use of generative artificial intelligence and large language models for engineering large software systems, the need of large and unbiased datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating deep learning and large language models for software engineering, and the need of a new code of digital ethics to apply artificial intelligence in software engineering.},

This study finds that AI's main contributions to VR are in four key areas: creating intelligent virtual characters, advancing education and training, providing medical assistance, and generating dynamic scenes. This interdisciplinary convergence also brings significant opportunities, particularly in sectors such as education, healthcare, gaming, and corporate training. Additionally, the study discusses technical challenges related to computational costs, real-time feedback, user privacy, and algorithmic ethics. Critical challenges persist in data processing bottlenecks, privacy protection issues, and user adaptation. While AI enhances VR's intelligence and interactivity, breakthroughs are still needed in cross-modal integration, privacy, security, and user experience. Future advancements in deep learning and reinforcement learning may unlock unlimited potential for AI-driven VR in personalized adaptation and immersive interaction. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of AI–VR integration, providing valuable insights for academic research and technological development.},

Using a mixed research method (questionnaire survey, classroom experiment and content analysis), AIGC was found to have significant efficacy in multimodal resource generation, personalised feedback and intercultural scene simulation. The study proposes a three-dimensional collaborative teaching framework: teacher-AIGC-learners, which reveals that the core value of AIGC is to liberate teachers from mechanical labour and achieve precise teaching interventions. Meanwhile, the study faces the ethical dilemmas of academic integrity and data privacy, and proposes a governance framework that combines technological constraints, institutional norms, and humanistic education. The experimental data show that AIGC assistance increases students' writing complexity by 27.9\% and decreases their speaking anxiety index by 34\%, but there are also problems such as weakened critical thinking due to technological dependence. This study provides a reusable pedagogical model and risk coping strategy for the digital transformation of education.},

This paper takes the course of “Java Framework Application “in software technology major as the research object, discusses how to empower the traditional teaching mode through AIGC technology, and improve the teaching quality and practical effect of the course. Firstly, the pain points existing in the current Java framework course teaching were analyzed, including the shortage of case resources, the single practice scene, and the lack of personalized guidance. Secondly, combined with the technical characteristics of AIGC, a multi-dimensional application model covering code generation, intelligent question answering, scene simulation and learning effect evaluation was constructed. By introducing a large language model to automatically generate customized case codes of mainstream frameworks such as Spring Boot and MyBatis, conversational AI is used to assist students to solve development problems in real time, and a virtual project scene is constructed based on generative technology to strengthen engineering practice ability. Teaching practice shows that the application of AIGC technology greatly improves students 'code standardization and project development efficiency, and teachers can accurately locate learning weaknesses through intelligent analysis tools. This study provides a reusable implementation path for the intelligent transformation of technology courses, and verifies the empowering value of generative artificial intelligence in the field of vocational education, which has important reference significance for the optimization of future curriculum system.},

  abstract = {Over the past five years, the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a significant increase in research on AI in language education. This article uses CiteSpace software to conduct a visual analysis of research related to AI in language education from the SCI and SSCI databases over the past five years. The research results indicate that from 2020 to 2024, the number of papers related to AI in language education has been increasing steadily with the improvement of AI technologies. What's more, China, the United States, South Korea, England, and Saudi Arabia are the leading countries in terms of publication volume. Institutions such as the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Education University of Hong Kong, and Indiana University System (including Indiana University Bloomington), etc. have a significant number of publications, and collaborative publications among institutions are the mainstream. Moreover, the keyword co-occurrence graph shows that students’ English learning, large language models, natural language processing technology and deep learning are the foci of scholars' research. Keyword clustering graph and top terms in each cluster indicate that research in this field primarily focuses on English learning, particularly on speech and writing skills, and the psychological factors, learning effect, and learning strategies in the process of AI-assisted language education have also attracted the attention of scholars. Lastly, computational modeling technologies and mobile-assisted language learning are also topics that scholars have discussed extensively. The application of AI in non-English languages education, emotional factors of students and mobile-assisted language education driven by large language models may become hotspots in the future.},

  abstract = {This study is grounded in the resource-based view theory and examines 1,367 Chinese A-share listed companies from 2008 to 2023. Use the Python language to crawl words related to "supply chain risk" in corporate annual reports, which are used to calculate the supply chain risk of enterprises. The fixed effects model and the intermediary effect model are used to empirically test the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in mitigating the supply chain risk. Through empirical research, we find that: AI plays an instrumental role in mitigating corporate supply chain risk. AI mitigates the supply chain risk by improving resource allocation efficiency of enterprises. The heterogeneity analysis shows that for enterprises in highly competitive industries, the mitigating effect of AI on the supply chain risk is more evident; in non-technology-oriented enterprises, the mitigating effect of artificial intelligence on supply chain risk is more significant. This study contributes to the research on intelligent supply chain management and supply chain risk management.},

  abstract = {Cyber twin technology, a successful branch of simulation modeling in business, is now being applied in the healthcare sector. An intelligent architecture inspired by cyber twins is proposed to explore the unique visual, behavioral, and physiological experiences of individuals with anxiety disorders while working in smart office environments. Temporal data mining is utilized for framing data granules, and quantum probability techniques are employed for anomaly detection within the framework. Additionally, a novel multilayer Convolutional Neural Network is introduced to predict a quantifiable Health Vulnerability Index. A smart alert system is included, capable of notifying caregivers of any identified health concerns, enabling timely assistance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, it was tested on real-world data comprising 82,235 cases. The results demonstrate that the method excels in several key performance metrics: time efficiency (24.6 seconds), classification efficiency (Precision (92.77\%), Specificity (92.43\%), and Sensitivity (92.82\%)), decision-making efficiency ( (r^{2}=79\%) ), error rate (AAE 0.31\%), and stability (75\%), surpassing current state-of-the-art methodologies.},

This progress did not occur in a vacuum. AI emerged against a rich background of technologies from computer science and ideas about intelligence and learning from philosophy, psychology, logic, game theory, and cognitive science. We sketch out the enabling technologies for AI. They include search, reasoning, neural networks, natural language processing, signal processing and computer graphics, programming and conventional software engineering, human-computer interaction, communications, and specialized hardware that provides supercomputing power. Beyond these technologies is the notion of Artificial General Intelligence that has or exceeds the capabilities of the human brain. Currently this is completely aspirational and is not expected to be possible before 2025, if ever. Artificial Intelligence is based on a variety of technologies, none of which seek to emulate human intelligence.},

They are trained on billions of words of text scraped from the internet. They generate text responses to text inputs. They have transformed the public awareness of artificial intelligence, bringing on reactions ranging from astonishment and awe to trepidation and horror. They have spurred massive investments in new tools for drafting texts, summarizing conversations, summarizing literature, generating images, coding simple programs, supporting education, and amusing humans. Experience with them has shown them likely to respond with fabrications (called "hallucinations") that severely undermine their trustworthiness and make them unsafe for critical applications. Here, we will examine the limitations of LLMs imposed by their design and function. These are not bugs but are inherent limitations of the technology. The same limitations make it unlikely that LLM machines will ever be capable of performing all human tasks at the skill levels of humans.},

  abstract = {In order to study the compressive strength of cemented gravel, a compressive strength prediction model was established; with 142 groups of in-house uniaxial compressive strength test data of cemented gravel with different mixing ratios as the object of study, the 11 influencing factors in the samples were downscaled by using the principal component analysis method, and the downscaled principal components were used as the input layer of the BPNN, so as to establish the compressive strength prediction of cemented gravel based on the PCA-BPNN model. The results show that when the number of principal components is 3, the cumulative contribution rate of the principal components reaches 86.483\%, and the contribution rates of the three principal components are 65.084\%, 11.702\%, 9.097\%, and the eigenvalues of the three principal components are all greater than 1. Then the three principal components are used as the input layer to build the compressive strength model of cemented gravel based on PCA-BPNN, and the RMSEs of the training set and test set are 0.253 and 0.28, respectively. The RMSE of the training set and the test set are 0.253 and 0.286, and the R2 is 0.947 and 0.942, which are not much different from the BPNN model with the number of nodes in the input layer of 6 and 11 before dimensionality reduction, and they are obviously better than the BPNN model in the convergence speed and training time. It can be seen that the PCA-BPNN model has good prediction effect and prediction efficiency, especially drastically reducing the training time, which provides a new idea for the prediction research of the mechanical properties of cemented gravel.},

  abstract = {Image generation using generative artificial intelligence has become a popular activity. However, text-to-image generation—where images are produced from typed prompts—can be less engaging in public settings since the act of typing tends to limit interactive audience participation, thereby reducing its suitability for designing dynamic public installations. In this article, we explore body prompting as input modality for image generation in the context of public event settings. Body prompting extends interaction with generative AI beyond textual inputs to reconnect the creative act of image generation with the physical act of creating artworks. We implement this concept in an interactive art installation, Artworks Reimagined, designed to transform existing artworks via body prompting. We deployed the installation at an event with hundreds of visitors in a public and private setting. Our semi-structured interviews with a sample of visitors (N = 79) show that body prompting was well-received and provides an engaging and fun experience. We present insights into participants’ experience of body prompting and AI co-creation and identify three distinct strategies of embodied interaction focused on re-creating, reimagining, or casual interaction. We provide valuable recommendations for practitioners seeking to design interactive generative AI experiences in museums, galleries, and public event spaces.},

The Chinese government has introduced a number of strategic policies to promote the development of new generation artificial intelligence and has made significant progress, but there are still large differences in the research and development, application and industrialization of AI technology in different regions. To this end, this research sorted out the definition of new generation artificial intelligence and established a comprehensive evaluation index system including four dimensions: development scale, economic benefits, innovation input and scientific and technological output. Based on panel data from 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, the entropy method was used to analyze the development level of new generation artificial intelligence in various regions from 2017 to 2021. The results show that the overall development level of China's new generation of artificial intelligence shows a steady growth trend. The development of AI in the eastern region leads the country, while the development level of AI in the central, western and northeastern regions is relatively low, and the gap is widening year by year.},

  abstract = {Audio-driven talking-face synthesis is of significant importance in various application scenarios, such as remote meetings, AR/VR, and digital humans. Currently, the work in this field can be broadly divided into two categories: implicit representation-based methods and explicit representation-based methods. Implicit representation-based methods often use neural network models to represent human face. For example, NeRF (Neural Radiance Field) uses MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to represent human face, and by inputting the camera pose, NeRF renders a face image from that viewpoint. When training with audio features, it can render face images with different facial movements. However, due to the lack of editability and slow rendering speed of implicit representations, the industry has been exploring new representation methods. Explicit representation-based methods commonly use 3D Gaussian representations of the face, which offers high editability and nearly real-time rendering speed, making these methods surpass implicit-based approaches in many metrics. However, it is difficult to incorporate other signals during the rendering optimization process. To address this issue, this paper combines 3D Gaussian representations with the 3D head model FLAME (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions). The FLAME model represents the face's shape and facial movements with a set of parameters. In this paper, audio signals are first transformed into parameters representing facial movements, which are used to initialize the 3D model generated by the parameters, followed by rendering optimization. This paper proposes a 3D Gaussian-based audio-driven lip-sync video generation system. It consists of two main modules: the audio-to-facial movement module and the 3D Gaussian rendering module. The audio-to-facial movement module uses the extracted audio features to generate parameters that control the FLAME model, converting the audio input into natural and reasonable lip shapes and facial movements. The 3D Gaussian rendering module initializes the 3D Gaussian with the FLAME model, optimizes the rendered image from coarse to fine, and finally stitches the generated images together to create a continuous video. Experiments show that this system can generate lip-synchronized, accurate, high-fidelity videos.},

  abstract = {Audio-visual speech synthesis (AVSS) is a rapidly gaining prominence in artificial intelligence (AI) due to its widespread applications. AVSS refers to generating the audio-visual speech of a target speaker from the audio input of a source speaker, while preserving the speech content. The sequential steps of the AVSS process include voice conversion (VC) for altering vocal characteristics from the source to the target speaker and audio-visual synthesis (AVS) to generate a video stream from the converted speech of the target speaker. However, with the progressive development of deep generative models, the domain of AVSS remains relatively unexplored. The existing literature predominantly focuses on autoencoder-based AVSS models, potentially limiting their ability to capture the diversity of the vocal features and also synthesize the realistic video output. This paper introduces a novel AVSS approach utilizing a generative adversarial network (GAN) model, enriched with a capsule network (Caps-Net) architecture to effectively capture relevant input speech features and produce more natural audio-visual output. The proposed framework is trained and tested on VoxCeleb2 and LRS3-TED datasets and the experimental outcomes exhibit the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.},

The findings reveal that AI-generated background music significantly enhances user relaxation (average score: 5.75/9) and concentration (average score: 5.86/9).

  abstract = {This application paper introduces a transformative solution to address the labour-intensive manual report generation, data searching and report revision process in government entities. Traditional methods of data extraction, analysis, and graph creation for annual reports are not only time-consuming but also prone to human errors. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an innovative system leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), with a specific focus on large language models (LLMs). Our solution incorporates automated data extraction from diverse sources designated as internal knowledge base, text analysis, summarization using advanced language models, and the generation as well as revisions of informative graphs. Different LLMs like Google's Gemini Pro and OpenAI's GPT 4.0 have been used to read different data visualisation graphs and fetch the information from the internal knowledge base, respectively, to update the graphs in an automated manner. Solution implementation using Python language on the World Economic Situation and Prospects report by the Department of Economic \&amp; Social Affairs, United Nation shows that the early result produces almost 0.87\% to 17.46\% average error rates in the task of factual data visualisation graph. Key benefits of this approach include improved time efficiency, consistency in report format, enhanced insights, and a user-friendly interface. A review and approval workflow facilitate user feedback, contributing to continuous model performance improvement.},

  abstract = {Students often do not fully understand the code they have written. This sometimes does not become evident until later in their education, which can mean it is harder to fix their incorrect knowledge or misunderstandings. In addition, being able to fully understand code is increasingly important in a world where students have access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as GitHub Copilot. One effective solution is to utilise code comprehension questions, where a marker asks questions about a submission to gauge understanding, this can also have the side effect of helping to detect plagiarism. However, this approach is time consuming and can be difficult and/or expensive to scale. This paper introduces AutoMCQ, which uses GenAI for the automatic generation of multiple-choice code comprehension questions. This is integrated with the CodeRunner automated assessment platform.},

This paper proposes a few-shot incremental relation extraction model based on consistency prototype learning and multi-layer knowledge distillation. The model consists of data augmentation, consistency prototype learning, and dual-layer knowledge distillation. First, data augmentation is applied to the training data to alleviate common overfitting problems in few-shot scenarios. Second, consistency prototype learning is utilized to regularize the embedding space and address feature distortion. Additionally, a dual-teacher model for knowledge distillation is designed to prevent catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. Experiments conducted on the TACRED dataset show that after completing all tasks under the 5-way-5-shot setting, accuracy improved by 2.22\%. Our model significantly outperforms other baseline methods, validating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) has revolutionized software engineering (SE) by automating tasks across design, coding, and testing [1] [2]. Tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot streamline code generation, architectural modeling, debugging, and test-case creation [3] [4]. Despite their rapid adoption in industry, the pedagogical implications of these tools in computing education have not been systematically examined. This study solves the existing gap by conducting a comprehensive benchmarking study of Gen-AI tools across four core SE phases— design documentation, feature implementation, debugging support, and testing — to address two research questions:RQ1: What strengths and limitations do Gen-AI tools exhibit in each phase?RQ2: How can insights from benchmarking inform effective integration of Gen-AI into SE curricula?To answer these questions, a diverse set of Gen-AI tools is evaluated, ranging from design-focused assistants such as Lucidchart, Mermaid.js and UIzard; implementation-oriented systems including GitHub Copilot, TabNine, Codeium and Supermaven; debugging supports like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet; and testing frameworks such as Testim, Mabl and Applitools—while also surveying emerging platforms (as of summer 2024) like Replit, Postman, Visily, Gemini, Eraser.io and others. For each tool and development phase, we applied phase-specific metrics: in design documentation, we assessed diagram accuracy, completeness, user effort, and IDE integration; in feature implementation, we measured pattern-based code generation quality, code-completion effectiveness, refactoring robustness, and UI/UX scaffolding; in debugging, we evaluated error-detection accuracy, hallucination rates, and clarity of explanatory feedback; and in testing, we examined test-case relevance and defect-detection coverage. Across all phases, we tracked prompt engineering complexity as a key mediating factor influencing tool performance.Our evaluation reveals speed-fidelity trade-offs: Code-completion assistants accelerate boilerplate generation but demand manual oversight to ensure cross-file consistency and manage higher-order abstractions; diagramming tools can produce precise UML models with minimal effort— but at the cost of iterative prompt refinement for complex cases; LLM debuggers deliver context-sensitive fixes yet suffer from nontrivial hallucination rates; testing generators exhibit wide variance in edge-case coverage. On average, tools needed 2.4 prompt iterations for usable diagrams and 1.5 prompts for bug fixes, underscoring the human effort in guiding AI.We recommend a scaffolded framework for integrating Gen-AI into SE education by: embedding AI tools into hands-on assignments, to explore tasks in a controlled context; by structuring small team projects in which one subgroup uses AI assistants while the other completes the same tasks manually (covering design, implementation, debugging and testing) to surface contrasts in workflow, tool strengths, and human reasoning; by requiring students to maintain a reflective journal documenting their AI usage and prompt-engineering strategies, fostering metacognitive insight into how tool inputs shape outputs; and by equipping learners with decision making criteria, teaching them to evaluate AI assistants according to task fit- preparing them to leverage AI responsibly across SE phases in its evolving landscape.},

While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT dominate current educational research, multimodal capabilities—such as text-to-speech and text-to-image—are less explored. This study uses topic modeling to map the research landscape of multimodal and generative AI in education. An extensive literature search yielded 4175 articles. Employing a topic modeling approach, latent topics were extracted, resulting in 38 interpretable topics organized into 14 thematic areas. Findings indicate a predominant focus on text-to-text models in educational contexts, with other modalities underexplored, overlooking the broader potential of multimodal approaches. The results suggest a research gap, stressing the importance of more balanced attention across different AI modalities and educational levels. In summary, this research provides an overview of current trends in generative AI for education, underlining opportunities for future exploration of multimodal technologies to fully realize the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in education.},

  abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.},

  abstract = {With ‘Generative Artificial Intelligence’ (GenAI), a new momentum has swept public opinion and, as with the Times front page on 27 February 2023, which describes an ‘arms race’ among major companies. While the GenAI in the workplace is new, the few studies suggest several benefits of such systems in work contexts. However, these results focus on the quantitative indicators, and further literature on the implementation of generative AI systems at work is still scarce. In this context, it is important to specify how to integrate a GenAI-based tool into an existing socio-technical organisation, as such integration always deeply transforms the employees’ activity. In this paper, we discuss the human-centred design of GenAI-based tools on the basis of an ergonomics intervention for the Ombudsman's team of an energy utility company. We explore how a participatory design approach – grounded in the preliminary analysis of the work – can help inform the development of a GenAI-based tool. We discuss the relevance of this methodology and the intermediary role of the ergonomists, given the dual challenge that end-users often lack a comprehensive understanding of GenAI's possibilities and potential applications, while data-scientists responsible for developing such tools are not trained to analyse complex work activities, which is a necessary step for selecting and training the appropriate AI models.},

However, these models are heavily dependent on the size and quality of the training corpus and exhibit poor performance when faced with unknown errors. Inspired by adversarial learning, this paper focuses on Chinese character input scenarios and propose an effective attack strategy to generate more valuable training examples in these scenarios. This strategy jointly utilizes the attention mechanism and the logit output to determine the attack position and generates misspelling instances in a perturbed pinyin manner. The generated adversarial samples are then gradually added to the training set to train the model. Further, this paper explores the effect of the proportion of samples in the adversarial training process on model performance. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy are demonstrated on three different architectural baseline models.},

  abstract = {The use of mobile phone APP meter reading reduces the probability of human intervention and misidentification, but due to the complex location and geographical conditions of the buried water meter, as well as the base code and gear in the water meter dial, there are problems of low accuracy and rough segmentation results when the water meter word wheel region is divided, so a YOLO v8 segmentation method based on coordinate attention mechanism is proposed. The backbone network incorporates the AM (Attention-MobileNet_block) module to apply the Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism, which facilitates the extraction of multi-scale features, reduces model parameters and computational complexity, and enhances computing efficiency. In the feature fusion stage, the C2f_CA mechanism, based on the Bottleneck_CA module, effectively mitigates background interference while concentrating on the water meter's target region. Experimental results indicate that, compared to other segmentation models, our model achieves an F1-score of 98.61\% and a mean Pixel Accuracy (mPA) of 99.11\% for word wheel region segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the precise identification of water meter code words in the future.},

Generative AI is also gradually becoming an interaction mode between enterprises and customers, improving customer experience and influencing their continued use intention. However, there is still uncertainty as to whether users are willing to use generative AI-driven products and services for a long time. Previous studies have mostly been based on traditional industries. How to enhance users’ continued use intention from the perspective of AI has become a widely concerned issue in academia and industry.Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Expectation Confirmation Theory (ECT), this study explores the impact of generative AI features on users’ continued use intention by improving the two paths of user perceived value and user satisfaction. 306 valid questionnaires were used, and SPSS 27.0 and SEM were used for data analysis and hypothesis testing. The results show that (1) generative AI features have a significant positive impact on users’ continued use intention; (2) user perceived value and user satisfaction play a mediating role in the relationship between generative AI features and users’ continued use intention. This finding improves users’ continued use intention of generative AI features, which is of great significance for understanding the marketing layout of generative AI for enterprises.},

  abstract = {Human-Computer Interaction practitioners have been proposing best practices in user interface design for decades. However, generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) brings additional design considerations and currently lacks sufficient user guidance regarding affordances, inputs, and outputs. In this context, we developed a recommender system to promote responsible AI (RAI) practices while people prompt GenAI systems, by recommending addition of sentences based on social values and removal of harmful sentences. We detail a lightweight recommender system designed to be used in prompting-time and compare its recommendations to the ones provided by three base large language models (LLMs) and two LLMs fine-tuned for the task, i.e., recommending inclusion of sentences based on social values and removal of harmful sentences from a given prompt. Results indicate that our approach has the best F1-score balance in terms of recommendations for additions and removal of sentences to promote responsible prompts, while a fine-tuned model obtained the best F1-score for additions, and our approach obtained the best F1-score for removals of harmful sentences. In addition, fine-tuned models improved the objectiveness of responses by reducing the verbosity of generated content in 93\% when compared to the content generated by base models. Presented findings contribute to RAI by showing the limits and bias of existing LLMs in terms of recommendations on how to create more responsible prompts and how open-source technologies can fill this gap in prompting-time.},

With recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), current research tries to tackle these constraints by deploying AI-generated content (AIGC) in AR applications. However, our preliminary study with six AR practitioners revealed that the current AIGC lacks contextual information to adapt to varying application scenarios and is therefore limited in authoring. To utilize the strong generative power of GenAI to ease the authoring of AR instruction while capturing the context, we developed CARING-AI, an AR system to author context-aware humanoid-avatar-based instructions with GenAI. By navigating in the environment, users naturally provide contextual information to generate humanoid-avatar animation as AR instructions that blend in the context spatially and temporally. We showcased three application scenarios of CARING-AI: Asynchronous Instructions, Remote Instructions, and Ad Hoc Instructions based on a design space of AIGC in AR Instructions. With two user studies (N=12), we assessed the system usability of CARING-AI and demonstrated the easiness and effectiveness of authoring with Gen-AI.},

The cause explains the “why,” whereas the effect describes the “what.” The domain itself encompasses a plethora of disciplines from statistics and computer science to economics and philosophy. Recent advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence systems have nourished a renewed interest in identifying and estimating the cause-and-effect relationship from the substantial amount of available observational data. This has resulted in various new studies aimed at providing novel methods for identifying and estimating causal inference. We include a detailed taxonomy of causal inference frameworks, methods, and evaluation. An overview of causality for security is also provided. Open challenges are detailed, and approaches for evaluating the robustness of causal inference methods are described. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey on such studies of causality.

Furthermore, deep learning-based traffic image classification models often become overly complex in their pursuit of higher accuracy. In the paper, we propose a deep learning model-based method for the visual detection of DDoS malicious traffic. In response to the issue of model complexity, this article has made improvements based on the EfficientNet model, especially in resource constrained environments. This article introduces CBAM into the original model to improve its ability to process global information. By replacing the loss function in the final Softmax layer of the EfficientNet model, the ability to extract image features for binary classification problems has been enhanced, resulting in improved model performance. The experimental results show that this method can effectively identify various DDoS attacks. Compared with the EfficientNet model, this method has improved accuracy, training time, and single image prediction time.},

This paper presents an automated radiology report generation framework that combines Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) with a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to bridge AI performance with clinical explainability. CBMs map chest X-ray features to human-understandable clinical concepts, enabling transparent disease classification. Meanwhile, the RAG system integrates multi-agent collaboration and external knowledge to produce contextually rich, evidence-based reports. Our demonstration showcases the system’s ability to deliver interpretable predictions, mitigate hallucinations, and generate high-quality, tailored reports with an interactive interface addressing accuracy, trust, and usability challenges.

  abstract = {The 3D animation is emerging with the fast improvement in the artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This paper presents a complete survey about the application of AI in the pre-fabricated design of 3D animation scenes. Also includes the challenges and opportunities in the role of AI in 3D animation. The basic applications of AI in scene design, including automated element layout, maintenance of stylistic consistency, and dynamic environment simulation are also discussed. We discuss the use of AI methods such as, deep learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and reinforcement learning in helping the animators with creative ideas and enhancing the scene design. The difficulties in the scene design process like limitations in creative expression, difficulties in technological integration are also discussed in this paper along with the challenges with respect to traditional animation techniques. In addition, the paper discusses the research directions in the automation features of AI and the human artistic creation.},

  abstract = {The pervasiveness of the dissemination of fake news through social media platforms poses critical risks to the trust of the general public, societal stability, and democratic institutions. This challenge calls for novel methodologies in detection, which can keep pace with the dynamic and multi-modal nature of misinformation. Recent works include powering the detection using large language model advances in multimodal frameworks, methodologies using graphs, and adversarial training in the literature of fake news. Based on the different approaches which can bring success, some key highlights will be underlined: enhanced LLM-improves accuracy through more advanced semantics and cross-modality fusion for robust detections. The review further identifies critical gaps in adaptability to dynamic social media trends, real-time, and cross-platform detection capabilities. Future directions underline the development of style-agnostic models, cross-lingual detection frameworks, and robust policies with a view to mitigating LLM-driven misinformation. This synthesis thus lays a concrete foundation for those researchers and practitioners committed to reinforcing fake news detection systems with complications that keep on growing in the digital landscape.},

Our work builds on this scholarship by investigating how neurodivergent individuals use Large Language Model-based chatbots in real-life settings. We conducted interviews with 15 neurodivergent participants to understand their expansive use of these chatbots, which we present as use case categories. We then designed diary studies to capture prompting strategies participants employ within these use cases while conversing with the Large Language Model-based chatbot Gemini. Based on early analysis of our conversational dataset, we showcase specific prompting queries from participants, highlight participant strategies to refine Gemini’s responses, and identify Gemini’s strengths and weaknesses during interaction.},

  abstract = {The release of popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT have prompted universities to introduce new policies or update existing ones. Currently, most institutions adapt their policies reactively as challenges arise, often without adopting a systematic framework, with minimal guidance and limited knowledge of the approaches taken by other institutions across the United States (U.S.). This study aims to bridge this gap by identifying core themes surrounding AI policies and guidelines across the top 50 U.S. universities. Given the labor- and time-intensive nature required to manually synthesize multiple policy documents across many institutions, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to identify common and prevalent themes. Our framework first summarizes AI policies at the institutional level, followed by the generation of multiple sets of themes through an iterative process of prompt chaining and self-refinement. Finally, the common themes from these distinct sets were consolidated. This framework is designed to address potential flaws in pre-trained LLMs, such as hallucinations. Seven distinct themes are uncovered: (1) academic integrity and responsible AI use, (2) communication of AI policies, (3) data privacy and security concerns, (4) ethical considerations in AI use, (5) continuous adaptation and policy evolution, (6) documentation and transparency in AI usage, and (7) instructor discretion in AI integration. Our work lays the foundation for future analyses or recommendations in developing comprehensive and equitable AI policies. Furthermore, leveraging LLMs allows us to respond swiftly to developments surrounding AI policies across universities.},

However, there is still a lack of in-depth exploration of the application of ChatGPT and other technologies in education, especially in areas such as personalized learning and precision teaching, the integration of virtual and actual teaching spaces, intelligent teaching facilities and resources, human-computer collaborative teaching methods, and interdisciplinary innovative research methods.We should actively respond to the opportunities and challenges brought by intelligent tools such as ChatGPT to higher education, and comprehensively and deeply explore how to integrate ChatGPT into key areas of digital education, including teaching design, teaching resource development, teaching organization and implementation, teaching evaluation and reflection, learning and personal knowledge management, innovation team building, and enhancing the digital literacy and professional capabilities of teachers and students. In addition, the impact of the application of ChatGPT and other technologies in education on educational equity, and how to ensure that all students can benefit from it through reasonable design and use, should also be of concern. The goal of this study is to further promote and drive the digital transformation of higher education by building a brand new higher education ecosystem based on ChatGPT.},

Utilizing GPT-4 to evaluate 1,022 core tasks across 51 public sector occupations, we provide an exploratory analysis of the roles susceptible to ChatGPT automation and those in which ChatGPT can augment human efforts. Our findings reveal that while 63\% of tasks are resistant to ChatGPT replacement, primarily due to their requirement for physical presence, emotional intelligence, and complex decision-making, tasks that are routine, rule-based, and involving basic content generation show a high potential for automation. The study also identifies key skills that will remain vital, those likely to become obsolete, and new skills that will emerge as essential, highlighting the need for a strategic approach to workforce development in the face of AI advancements. In particular, our findings underscore the growing importance of skills in applying AI technologies and the ability to validate and interpret AI-generated content for humans to remain competitive. We offer insights into public-sector-specific impacts and propose a methodological framework for future research, emphasizing the importance of adapting educational curricula and policies to prepare for an AI-integrated future.},

  abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) simplify complex learner data into accessible visualisations, providing actionable insights for educators and students. However, their educational effectiveness has not always matched the sophistication of the technology behind them. Explanatory and interactive LADs, enhanced by generative AI (GenAI) chatbots, hold promise by enabling dynamic, dialogue-based interactions with data visualisations and offering personalised feedback through text. Yet, the effectiveness of these tools may be limited by learners’ varying levels of GenAI literacy, a factor that remains underexplored in current research. This study investigates the role of GenAI literacy in learner interactions with conventional (reactive) versus scaffolding (proactive) chatbot-assisted LADs. Through a comparative analysis of 81 participants, we examine how GenAI literacy is associated with learners’ ability to interpret complex visualisations and their cognitive processes during interactions with chatbot-assisted LADs. Results show that while both chatbots significantly improved learner comprehension, those with higher GenAI literacy benefited the most, particularly with conventional chatbots, demonstrating diverse prompting strategies. Findings highlight the importance of considering learners’ GenAI literacy when integrating GenAI chatbots in LADs and educational technologies. Incorporating scaffolding techniques within GenAI chatbots can be an effective strategy, offering a more guided experience that reduces reliance on learners’ GenAI literacy.},

Through 12 post-class group interviews, we identified how GenAI co-design behaviors present both benefits—such as enhanced creativity and faster design iterations—and risks, including shallow learning and reflection. Benefits were most evident during the execution phases, while the discovery and reflection phases showed limited gains. A taxonomy of usage patterns revealed that students’ outcomes depended more on how they used GenAI than the specific tasks performed. These findings highlight the need for HCI education to adapt to GenAI’s role and offer recommendations for curricula to better prepare future designers for effective creative co-design.},

This gap is particularly concerning as educational institutions and industry organizations struggle to establish guidelines for GenAI use in TCCs. Without proper frameworks for integration, there are risks of: (1) Over-reliance on AI, potentially compromising fundamental skill development, and (2) Misalignment between traditional evaluation metrics and emerging co-intelligent programming practices. This doctoral research proposal aims to explore potential solutions for these issues.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence poses new challenges around assessment, increasingly driving introductory programming educators to employ invigilated exams. But exams do not afford more authentic programming experiences that involve planning, implementing, and debugging programs with computer interaction. In this experience report, we describe code interviews: a more authentic assessment method for take-home programming assignments. Through action research, we experimented with the number and type of questions as well as whether interviews were conducted individually or with groups of students. To scale the program, we converted most of our weekly teaching assistant (TA) sections to conduct code interviews on 5 major weekly take-home programming assignments. By triangulating data from 5 sources, we identified 4 themes. Code interviews (1) pushed students to discuss their work, motivating more nuanced but sometimes repetitive insights; (2) enabled peer learning, reducing stress in some ways but increasing stress in other ways; (3) scaled with TA-led sections, replacing familiar practice with an unfamiliar assessment; (4) focused on student contributions, limiting opportunities for TAs to give guidance and feedback. We reflect on the design of code interviews for student experience, academic integrity, and teacher workload.},

  abstract = {Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims to address incomplete facts in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). As a mainstream approach for KGC, text-based methods are limited in performance due to insufficient knowledge caused by constraints in fine-tuning data. To incorporate broader external knowledge, some researchers explored KGC approaches based on large language models (LLMs), but general-purpose LLMs lack direct awareness of knowledge graph domain knowledge, making it challenging for them to independently perform KGC tasks. To balance the dependence of text-based methods on knowledge graph domain knowledge and LLMs on external knowledge, we propose Collaborative Enhancement using Large Language Model for KGC (ColKGC). We define the prompt template to implement the interaction between the text-based model and the LLMs, and divide the knowledge graph completion process into two stages. In the concept enhancement stage, we supplement the fine-tuning data by interacting with the prompts of the LLMs to enrich the graph domain knowledge learned by the text-based model. In completion inference stage, we adopted the iterative interaction strategy, taking the text-based model output as the prompt and taking the interaction content of the previous stage as the context to enhance the inference, which improved the LLMs' understanding of the KGC task. Our experiments demonstrate that ColKGC achieves superior results across various standard knowledge graph benchmarks. Extensive experiments also bear out ColKGC's efectiveness in generated data and the iterative interaction framework in assisting LLMs reasoning.},

By introducing dual random phase encoding and leveraging the dual-chaotic system along with Arnold transformation, the authentication image is encrypted. The authentication and encrypted images are combined, and the dual-chaos system along with DNA dynamic encoding and computation methods are employed to perform encryption and decryption on the combined image, thereby achieving both image encryption and authentication. In the performance analysis of the encrypted images, the algorithm proposed in this paper not only provides authentication functionality but also demonstrates strong security, with advantages such as high decryption quality and fast encryption speed. Furthermore, its authentication feature makes it suitable for most encryption scenarios.},

Reviewing existing literature on AI applications in science, engineering, arts, and more, it brings forth unique contributions to progress in each area. This paper will research cross-national disparities in the development of AI talent, how educational policies, as well as industrial demands, impact training. A mixed-method approach is used in the analysis, with data and case studies from various countries to understand AI talent development. AI applications vary across countries and fields, exposing gaps in policy and education. Advanced countries invest in AI healthcare research to take the lead in sophisticated diagnostic systems. It is in developing countries where AI helps most: increased productivity in agriculture. The priority and resources will be dictated by local needs. Education and its resources and initiatives are in place for talent development, guiding policymakers and industry leaders on how to develop AI. This will develop the expertise necessary for advancing global AI technology. For example, in the area of education, enough resources can be put in place to ensure that students are abreast of state-of-the-art facilities and knowledge. Interdisciplinary initiatives, such as the integration of computer science with psychology or sociology, can yield a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between artificial intelligence and human behavior as well as social structures. By acknowledging these factors, it is essential to formulate strategies that foster an ecosystem conducive to the growth of AI expertise and propel international advancements in AI technology.},

However, practical obstacles remain, such as time constraints and students’ passive participation and the low quality of peer feedback. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been explored for its potential to automate grading and provide timely feedback, making it a valuable tool in formative assessment. Nevertheless, there is still limited research on how AI can be used effectively in the context of formative peer assessment. In this study, we conducted an AI-driven formative peer assessment with 108 secondary school students. During the peer assessment process, students not only evaluated peers’ responses and received peer-generated feedback, but also evaluated AI-generated responses and received AI-generated feedback. This research focused on analyzing the differences in preference between AI-generated and peer-generated feedback using trace data and dispositional data. In scenarios where student participation was low or the quality of peer feedback was insufficient, students showed a higher preference for AI-generated feedback, demonstrating its potential utility. However, students with high Math Confidence and AI Interest preferred peer-generated feedback. Based on these findings, we will propose practical strategies for implementing AI-driven formative peer assessment.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to design a chatbot application to help people find an appropriate restaurant based on users' preferences and transportation modes. It also aims to explore whether a machine learning-based chat agent is capable of accomplishing all the tasks precisely, or whether it could be optimized by collaborating with other simple agents. This paper establishes a chatbot environment along with a series of agents (machine learning agent, grammar checker agent, spelling checker agent, restaurant searcher), designed to assist users in finding a restaurant mainly based on what transportation they use and if a restaurant is found, the chatbot could display the route to this place in the prompt also with map details by employing the Google map API. The machine learning agent acting as the brain of this chatbot, could not only be able to evoke other agents corresponding to users’ input but also could directly store what kinds of transportation are taken by users and pass to Google map API to search appropriate restaurants instead of fully relying on a restaurant searcher agent (rule-based agent). To examine whether multiple agents coordinate with each other could outperform a single agent. A contrast experiment is conducted to conclude the result, which involves 15 participants who run through this program under two different setups (with and without spelling and grammar checkers) and each of them would give a query to this chatbot but this query would be dealt with and without spelling and grammar checker respectively. The result would be quantitatively evaluated by two metrics: Success Rate: successfully finding a restaurant and showing the map; the Total of Queries. Results suggest that pre-processing input with spelling and grammar checkers significantly improves the chatbot's performance, achieving an 80\% success rate (12 out of 15 queries). In contrast, when input is not pre-processed, the success rate drops to 46.66\% (7 out of 15 queries). This indicates that the involvement of spelling and grammar checker agents enhances the accuracy and efficiency of restaurant searches, making the collaborative multi-agent setup more effective. Moreover, it could demonstrate that this chatbot environment is well constructed since it could successfully provide suitable restaurants given users’ requirements.},

Taking the "Obstacle Avoidance Design of Intelligent Logistics Robots" project of the Python course in higher vocational education as a case for practical verification, the results show that students' mastery rate of sensor principles, code debugging efficiency, and ability of cross-scenario knowledge transfer have all improved.

To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel controllable 3D urban generation pipeline, which consists of urban layouts and 3D scenes generation. Specifically, we introduce the graph dynamic attention model and the dummy node to enhance the diversity of the generated results. We also design a scene asset matching method based on the CLIP model to controllably generate 3D urban scenes. Experimental results indicate that the diversity of the generated results surpasses that of existing methods, and the generated 3D urban scenes are of good consistency.},

The use of artificial intelligence technology, especially large model technology, can promote students' inclination towards creativity and creative thinking. However, it is essential to guide students to engage in deep thinking before designing prompts based on their ideas, thereby fostering their creative and critical thinking through human-machine collaboration. This study takes a certain experimental school as a case to explore the effectiveness of creative accessibility in the AI dual-teacher classroom environment and its application technology in primary and secondary schools.},

  abstract = {Generative AI tools are increasingly embedded in creative workflows, yet their outputs often misalign with user expectations, producing results that are ambiguous, contradictory, or oddly off-mark. Rather than treating such misalignments as failures to be corrected, this paper reframes them as sources of creative ambiguity and cognitive tension. Drawing on theories of cognitive dissonance, frame conflict, and prediction error, I show how these tensions can catalyze reflection, reinterpretation, and creative reframing. Through five cross-modal cases spanning writing, design, music, code, and prototyping I demonstrate how creative ambiguity and cognitive tension function as generative forces in human–AI interaction. This work contributes to HCI and creativity support by proposing a shift from optimization toward reflection, designing not to minimize friction, but to work with it.},

  abstract = {Cameras are increasingly augmented with computational processing, producing images that blur the line between documenting reality and creative expression. The rise of text-to-image models has redefined the concept of imagery, sparking ethical and philosophical debates. This paper presents the findings of a qualitative study that employed a provocative prototype ‘camera’ – the A(I)Cam – to engage creative practitioners directly in these discussions. Developed using a Research-through-Design (RtD) approach, the tangible prototype generates and instantly prints AI-created images. A(I)Cam facilitated reflection among creative practitioners (N=15) on their experiences with AI-driven tools and the broader implications for their future practices. We examine the shifts in perspective that emerged from engaging with this embodied form of generative AI (genAI), challenging traditional text-based interaction paradigms, and inviting new modes of creative exploration and reflection. In addition, we offer insights from the RtD project, highlighting the integration of genAI tools into the industrial design process.},

To address this issue, we organized a collaborative workshop with four experts to brainstorm activities to teach AI to children. As a result, we developed Creat’AI — a GenAI-powered tangible prototype that co-creates original stories with children. We evaluated Creat’AI in a school with 17 children from the 1st grade. Our preliminary findings show that children were engaged in the activities and understood AI’s capability to generate original content, and changed their previous perception of AI and recognized that AI-generated content can be inaccurate. These results highlight the prototype’s potential in promoting AI literacy, contributing to the responsible and informed use of AI by young children.},

However, AI-generated images often lack cultural context, which risks cultural bias and the loss of cultural significance. This study explores the use of GAI in generating culturally meaningful patterns, focusing on Chinese intangible cultural heritage Huayao cross-stitch as a case study. By applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to optimize T2I tools and using in-situ interviews and focus groups, we collected feedback from 18 Huayao artisans. The results show that while fine-tuned models improved stylistic accuracy, the cultural meaning of the patterns remained insufficient. This research highlights AI's limited role in cultural innovation and emphasizes the necessity for dynamically maintaining cultural authenticity through the daily practices of cultural holders. It also reflects on how AI might have a long-term impact on the creative position of artisan communities.},

Survivability testing is usually implemented by simulating real hacker attacks, but this kind of testing and evaluation method depends on the professional level of testers to a large extent. There are problems such as incomplete testing and low testing efficiency. This paper comprehensively utilizes the ATT&amp;CK (Adversarial Tactics, Technologies, and Common Knowledge) and D3FEND (Defensive Tactics, Technologies, and Common Knowledge) frameworks of MITRE, aiming to propose a new cybersecurity survivability testing technology. Through in-depth analysis of the attack tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in the ATT&amp;CK framework, combined with the defense strategies and measures in the D3FEND framework, this paper designs a cybersecurity survivability evaluation program. This scheme not only evaluates the protection, detection, response and recovery capabilities of the system against network attacks, but also provides a scientific and perfect defense measures for the system. The case study further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and shows how to conduct survivability testing against attacks on the Linux operating system. This study provides a new perspective and practical guidance for the development of cybersecurity defense technology.},

The experimental results of DAT-YOLO on the VisDrone dataset show that with a 57.5\% reduction in parameter count, the mAP@50 and the mAP@50:95 has also increased by 6.7\% and 5.0\% respectively, making it suitable for drone target detection tasks.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is driving significant environmental impacts. The rapid development and deployment of larger algorithmic models consumes substantially more energy than traditional models, contributing to rising carbon emissions, water withdrawal, and e-waste generation. To mitigate these impacts, big tech companies are developing different strategies such as turning to nuclear energy to meet the demand for GenAI electricity and avoid carbon emissions, an approach that could have profound social and environmental implications beyond carbon reduction.This paper proposes a critical rethinking of GenAI’s proliferation through an ecofeminist framing, which has historically interrogated the role of science and technology in the context of gender and environmental justice. To do so, it introduces seven data ecofeminist principles delineating a pathway for developing technological and just transition alternatives within the AI research context, emphasising a critical examination of this technology’s role in the current socio-ecological crisis. The paper calls for an urgent reassessment of the GenAI innovation race, advocating for ecological and feminist technological projects that prioritise and respect life, people, and the planet.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making a profound impact in almost every domain. A vital enabler of its great success is the availability of abundant and high-quality data for building machine learning models. Recently, the role of data in AI has been significantly magnified, giving rise to the emerging concept of data-centric AI. The attention of researchers and practitioners has gradually shifted from advancing model design to enhancing the quality and quantity of the data. In this survey, we discuss the necessity of data-centric AI, followed by a holistic view of three general data-centric goals (training data development, inference data development, and data maintenance) and the representative methods. We also organize the existing literature from automation and collaboration perspectives, discuss the challenges, and tabulate the benchmarks for various tasks. We believe this is the first comprehensive survey that provides a global view of a spectrum of tasks across various stages of the data lifecycle. We hope it can help the readers efficiently grasp a broad picture of this field, and equip them with the techniques and further research ideas to systematically engineer data for building AI systems. A companion list of data-centric AI resources will be regularly updated on .},

  abstract = {Substantial progress has been made in how educators can be supported to implement effective learning design (LD) with learning analytics (LA). However, how educators make micro-decisions about designing individual teaching and learning activities (TLAs) and how these are related to wider pedagogical approaches has received limited empirical support. This study explored how 165 educators designed and integrated 12,749 TLA in 218 LDs using clustering, pattern-mining, and correlational analysis. The findings suggest most educators use a combination of four common LD TLAs (i.e., Collaboration, Generating independent learning, Assessment, and Traditional classroom activities). The four common TLAs could be used to develop LA and Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) approaches to support educators in making more informed and evidence-based design decisions for effective learning and teaching.},

  abstract = {The curricular design of programs in Higher Education is increasingly oriented towards competence-based learning goals in order to provide more specific and explicit qualifications. At the same time the descriptions of competences are mostly based on textual descriptions often in informal style targeted towards different audiences making descriptions vague and harder to compare. Formal models for the specification of competences exist for some time and even semantic models are being developed, e.g., the European Learning Model. These different approaches lead to a gap between formal and informal competence descriptions that require manual efforts of curriculum designer to maintain. This research borrows the concept of Deep and Surface representation models from the field of linguistics to unify the different approaches. Additionally, it focuses on the functionality of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the form of Large Language Models to close the aforementioned gap. It demonstrates the potential of the technology in both directions and discusses application potential of the concept.},

The research adopts advanced technologies such as intelligent speech recognition, natural language processing and machine learning to build an efficient and interactive learning environment. By integrating virtual reality and augmented reality technology, the system strengthens students' language application ability and encourages communication in simulated or actual contexts. The classroom teaching mode covers three stages: before class, during class and after class, to ensure the comprehensive improvement of students' listening and speaking skills. ITS module design includes student model, teacher model and expert model, which realizes the adjustment of personalized teaching content, evaluates learning results and provides targeted solutions. The realization of system functions depends on three core components: remote courseware service system, customer mobile learning system and data agent system, providing a stable and efficient personalized adaptive learning experience. The test results show that the system can still maintain high efficiency and stability when the number of concurrent users increases, which is superior to the traditional teaching system. In addition, intelligent composition correction, oral practice feedback, personalized learning plan recommendation and intelligent translation tools have significantly improved students' English writing ability and oral fluency.},

The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) enables consumers to easily modify a product by prompting a generative model, opening up opportunities to incorporate consumers in exploring the product design space. However, consumers often struggle to articulate their preferred product features due to their unfamiliarity with terminology and their limited understanding of the structure of product features. We present DesignFromX, a system that empowers consumer-driven design space exploration by helping consumers to design a product based on their preferences. Leveraging an effective GenAI-based framework, the system allows users to easily identify design features from product images and compose those features to generate conceptual images and 3D models of a new product. A user study with 24 participants demonstrates that DesignFromX lowers the barriers and frustration for consumer-driven design space explorations by enhancing both engagement and enjoyment for the participants.},

However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research.},

These intelligent interactive systems, shaped by innovations in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs), are materially impacting digital creative domains.

We shed light on the communities of design focus and decompose the system interaction designs, mapping these characteristics to creative domains, user interaction patterns, GenAI technologies, detailing under-represented spaces, and future directions of designing interactions for GenAI creativity.},

  abstract = {In this study, a rapid, accurate and intelligent method for detecting pesticide residues was developed by sensor arrays fused from surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) spectra of various substrates combined with deep learning. First, spectral data of pesticide residues were collected using conventional substrates with various morphologies. Then, the sensor array is acquired using different fusion methods on the spectral data, specifically concatenation and parallel methods. Finally, the intelligent and precise detection of chlormequat chloride and paraquat is implemented in a regression model constructed through the sensor array combined with machine learning and deep learning. In this experiment, the lowest detection limits for chlormequat chloride and paraquat detected are 0.03 mg/L and 0.003 mg/L, respectively. The regression model which was constructed using the sensor arrays obtained from the concatenation fusion method combined with the MobileNet obtained the best prediction results, with the coefficients of determination of prediction of 0.9865 and 0.9846 for chlormequat chloride and paraquat, and root-mean-square errors of prediction of 0.2254 and 0.0174, respectively. Overall, the method we proposed achieves rapid, intelligent and accurate detection of chlormequat chloride and paraquat, with the advantages of low cost and simple operation, which has great application potential in trace detection of pesticide residues.},

  abstract = {The software development life cycle (SDLC) is vital for ensuring the quality of software systems. However, learning SDLC concepts presents unique challenges, such as the need for effective collaboration, real-time interaction, and access to diverse skill sets represented in software development teams. To address these problems, we present DevCoach, a generative AI powered multi-agent system designed to support students learning the SDLC. DevCoach allows students to interact with generative AI agents simulating the different roles in the software development team, engaging in tasks across different phases of SDLC. Through a user study (n = 20), we evaluate the system's effectiveness in enhancing learning, impact on SDLC deliverables, and support for Community of Inquiry (CoI) elements necessary for effective and supportive learning environments. Our results reveal that students using DevCoach achieved significantly higher learning gains and improved task completion rates across all SDLC phases. The system also supports CoI elements, particularly perceived social presence. Participants also lauded the immediate context-aware feedback, interactive learning environment, and diverse expertise provided by the roles within the multi-agent team. These findings demonstrate the potential of generative AI to enhance software engineering education by making it more effective, engaging, and interactive, providing students with collaborative and practical learning experiences.},

Taking the development of computational thinking ability as the goal, we construct a ternary teaching model that covers the empowerment layer, teaching layer and target layer, and integrates generative artificial intelligence and project-based teaching method. Taking the course of Python Programming as an example, the teaching practice is carried out. The findings demonstrate that the approach considerably enhances students' overall computational thinking skills, particularly in task decomposition, algorithm design, and assessment reflection, and lessens the complexity of problem comprehension and program development. Meanwhile, further optimization strategies for teaching are proposed to provide practical paths and theoretical references for promoting curriculum integration and teaching innovation in the context of artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {This study contributes to the global conversation on artificial intelligence (AI) literacy, with a specific focus on Uganda, a sub-Saharan African region that has received limited attention in AI education research. As AI becomes increasingly pervasive, it is essential to introduce AI concepts to young children to promote their AI literacy. However, the current landscape of AI education in Uganda is not well understood. To address this gap, this research explores a community-based approach to teaching AI and machine learning (ML) to young children in out-of-school settings. The study aims to discover the kinds of AI-related knowledge and skills that young children can develop and how they can learn about AI in a non-formal educational context. The study will employ a design science methodology (DSM) to create and evaluate practical solutions, including methods, models, and concepts, that can inform AI education in Uganda. By combining systematic literature reviews, qualitative and quantitative methods, the research will generate robust empirical evidence that supports the effectiveness and relevance of the proposed solutions. Through these methods, the research will explore the role of community-based approaches in fostering young children's AI literacy. The study will investigate the effectiveness of informal learning environments, including homes, museums, churches, and children's camps. This will provide design recommendations for community-based AI education programs and in doing so, the study addresses the limited initiatives on promoting AI education for everyone, particularly in developing regions using informal settings.},

  abstract = {Aiming to address the need for child supervision in closed public spaces, this paper proposes an intelligent access control system based on face recognition. The system adopts lightweight MTCNN and MobileFaceNet algorithms to dynamically bind the identities of children and adults by generating unique ID codes (timestamp + random six-digit number). During entry, an adult generates an ID code via face detection and associates it with the child's information. During exit, a child can only pass if their ID code matches the associated adult's ID. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a recognition accuracy of 99.93\%, a single binding time of 2.8 seconds, and a database response time of less than 10 ms under high concurrency (1000 QPS). This system enables accurate guardianship without pre-registration and effectively reduces the risk of children getting lost or being taken by unauthorized individuals.},

However, traditional SiPSAs are predominantly thermally cured solvent-based products, which not only exhibit slow curing rates but also release harmful solvents like toluene during application, causing environmental pollution. To address this issue, this study Under the background of artificial intelligence. synthesized thiol-functionalized MTQ silicone resins (MTQ-SH) with various M/(T+Q) ratios using γ-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, tetraethyl orthosilicate, and hexamethyldisiloxane as raw materials. These resins were then photo-crosslinked with vinyl-terminated silicone oil to prepare UV-curable silicone PSAs (UV-SiPSAs). The results revealed that the optimal precursor ratio for UV-SiPSA preparation was M/T/Q = 1.00/0.21/1.58. When the photoinitiator TPO-L was added at 1 wt.\% and the molar ratio of thiol groups to vinyl end groups was 1.2:1, the resulting UV-SiPSA exhibited an initial adhesion strength capable of holding a 22# steel ball and a holding time of 230 minutes at 25℃. This UV-curable PSA shows promising potential for replacing traditional thermally cured silicone PSAs in the protective film industry.},

Methods: Stage 1: AI and doctor diagnoses were compared in detecting single and multiple heart sound abnormalities using a deep neural network (DNN) model. Performance was measured by Cohen's Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. Stage 2: Noise reduction technology was applied to assess its effect on AI performance in high-noise environments, using frequency-domain filtering, CNNs, and metrics like the Noise Impact Index (NII) and Noise Reduction Rate (NRR). Results: In Stage 1, the AI showed high consistency with doctors for single abnormalities (Cohen's Kappa = 0.81), but underperformed for multiple abnormalities. It achieved 96\% sensitivity, 93\% specificity, and an F1 score of 0.89, though performance was affected by noise. In Stage 2, noise reduction significantly improved AI accuracy, particularly in detecting multiple abnormalities, where AI outperformed doctors. Conclusion: The AI system demonstrated strong agreement with doctors, especially in detecting single abnormalities. Noise reduction technology enhanced its diagnostic accuracy and stability, particularly in complex environments. Further optimization is needed for more comprehensive performance in diverse cases.},

  abstract = {Our research investigates the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models, specifically text-to-image generators (T2Is), on the representation of non-Western cultures, with a focus on Indian contexts. Despite the transformative potential of T2Is in content creation, concerns have arisen regarding biases that may lead to misrepresentations and marginalizations. Through a Non-Western community-centered approach and grounded theory analysis of 5 focus groups from diverse Indian subcultures, we explore how T2I outputs to English input prompts depict Indian culture and its subcultures, uncovering novel representational harms such as exoticism and cultural misappropriation. These findings highlight the urgent need for inclusive and culturally sensitive T2I systems. We propose design guidelines informed by a sociotechnical perspective, contributing to the development of more equitable and representative GAI technologies globally. Our work underscores the necessity of adopting a community-centered approach to comprehend the sociotechnical dynamics of these models, complementing existing work in this space while identifying and addressing the potential negative repercussions and harms that may arise as these models are deployed on a global scale.},

Since the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), researchers have used specialized models to improve or automatize scientific processes and even scientific discoveries. In our study, we investigate whether proprietary large language models such as ChatGPT, though not specifically trained for scientific work, are able to convincingly perform or even surpass human scientific creativity. We asked graduate students and prompted ChatGPT to write an abbreviated version of a research proposal for a fictious scenario from the field of computer science/ robotics. Four specific assignments were given (i.e., formulating a hypothesis, designing an experiment, listing the required equipment, and justifying the chosen method). Human and AI-generated answers were rated by two scientists from the field, following a peer-review approach. Our results indicate that ChatGPT reached significantly higher overall scores relative to the human sample. However, closer inspection of the data and the rating procedure revealed that the evaluation of performance especially in regards to the originality of ideas differed considerably between the two raters. We evaluate these findings in more detail, as well as qualitative differences between human and AI- generated responses. Lastly, we discuss the impact of raters’ knowledge about and attitudes towards Generative AI and emphasize the importance of meta-cognitive skills to identify Generative AI.},

  abstract = {Existing recommender systems mainly rely on ID embedding to model user behavior sequences. However, this approach ignores the large amount of semantic information embedded in the textual descriptions of items, resulting in low performance. The ability to utilize large-scale language models to understand and reason about textual content offers a promising avenue for recommender system development. To this end, we propose a recommender system model, DPRS, which models textual representations of large-scale language models from a data distribution perspective and incorporates them into traditional recommendation models. We utilize pre-trained LLMs as item encoders to introduce textual representations to the recommender system. To address the heterogeneity between the LLM representations and the original recommender system, we propose to model user behavior sequences from a data distribution perspective by converting them into similarity score sequences. By conducting experiments on two public datasets, we verify the superiority of the proposed model.},

  abstract = {To better understand people’s inner worlds, the HCI community has explored ways to understand dream experience through generative AI (GAI). This paper presented “dream relay,” a novel approach to sharing dreams by integrating GAI. In the relay, participants used a dream probe to record their dreams, which were then visualized by GAI and shared with the next person as stimuli. We conducted a probe-based, group autoethnography study to explore how dream sharing was influenced in the way of relay and with GAI. Results showed how participants recorded their dreams and perceived the AI-generated dream visuals. This study also highlighted the value of GAI in sparking imagination and alleviating personal privacy concerns, which increased the willingness to share. Finally, we discussed the human-AI collaboration in reshaping dreams, as well as the role of GAI in facilitating social interaction.},

  abstract = {In scenarios with fixed time intervals, discrete-time dynamic graph (DTDG) is used to represent dynamic networks, such as social networks, traffic networks and biological networks. Existing models introduce self-attention mechanism for structural representation learning on discrete-time dynamic graph and demonstrate good performance in this field. However, temporal encoder in these models focuses on the entire time domain, introducing noise and limiting the model's ability to extract critical information. To address this issue, we propose the DyLF model based on Longformer mechanism. By incorporating the Longformer-based self-attention mechanism, DyLF can flexibly adjust the range of visible time domain while encoding temporal features of nodes in dynamic graphs and efficiently capture temporal dependencies between snapshots, thereby enhancing the ability to extract more effective temporal information. Extensive experiments show that DyLF achieves an average improvement of 4.28\% in AUC and 6.87\% in F1_score with the existing baseline, demonstrate that it is better suited for handling DTDGs.},

  abstract = {Despite significant advancements in multi-agent systems, solving the optimal path problem and addressing incomplete information remain challenging in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Traditional MARL algorithms often struggle with these two critical issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework called DDCF(Dynamic Decision Correction Framework) that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to optimize the decision-making process for agents navigating complex environments. The first key innovation of this framework is the application of LSTM networks, which enable agents to learn optimal paths over time while considering dynamic, temporal dependencies within the environment. The second key innovation is the introduction of a dynamic decision-making approach, which effectively handles the problem of incomplete information by enabling agents to make decisions based on both observable and inferred states. This decision method ensures that agents can intelligently handle uncertain environments by incorporating both certain and fuzzy information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of path optimization and decision-making performance, providing a robust solution for agents in environments characterized by incomplete information and complex decision tasks.},

To overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on a single mask optimization path, this work innovatively constructs a dual-path mask generation mechanism: a dual-path mask generation mechanism is proposed: (1) a noise filter based on the diffusion model generates the structure-optimized mask M2(M_diffusion); (2) a mask prediction branch integrated into the local decoder outputsM1(M_local), which preserves finer details. and based on the spatial adaptive weighting, the augmented aggregation formula is designed to achieve the feature complementation. Experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves detection capability and boundary segmentation accuracy in occluded scenes, and provide a new solution for instance segmentation of complex scenes.},

To this end, this paper focuses on artificial intelligence, especially the application of Deep Learning (DL) models in CT (computed tomography) image analysis and diagnosis, and explores its potential in early cancer detection. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to tumor detection in CT images. First, the image data is standardized, including resizing and normalization, to make sure that the input data is consistent, and more training samples are generated through methods for augmenting data (e.g., cropping, flipping, rotation, etc.) to enhance the model's capacity for generalization. The CNN model is primarily composed of convolutional layers, layers that pool together, fully linked layers, and functions for activation. The convolutional layers automatically extract low-level features (such as edges, textures, etc.) in the image through local receptive fields, and the pooling layers further reduce the feature dimension and enhance the model's anti-noise ability. Finally, the experimental data show that the method in this paper achieves an accuracy of 96.63 and a prediction time of 1.81 seconds, which is almost comparable to that of the professional doctor, but it is substantially shorter in prediction time.},

Recognizing the need to accommodate stakeholders' diverse fairness understandings, efforts are underway to solicit their input. However, conveying AI fairness metrics to stakeholders without AI expertise, capturing their personal preferences, and seeking a collective consensus remain challenging and underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a new framework, EARN (Explain, Ask, Review, and Negotiate) Fairness, which facilitates collective metric decisions among stakeholders without requiring AI expertise. The framework features an adaptable interactive system and a stakeholder-centered EARN Fairness process to Explain fairness metrics, Ask stakeholders' personal metric preferences, Review metrics collectively, and Negotiate a consensus on metric selection. To gather empirical results, we applied the framework to a credit rating scenario and conducted a user study involving 18 decision subjects without AI knowledge. We elicited their personal metric preferences and subsequently we studied how they reached metric consensus in team sessions. Our work shows that the EARN Fairness framework supports stakeholders to express and negotiate fairness preferences, and we provide practical guidance for implementing human-centered AI fairness in high-risk contexts. Through this approach, we aim to reach consensus of fairness perspectives, fostering more equitable and inclusive AI fairness.},

In contrast, moral rights allow the creators to be acknowledged and to take certain actions to preserve and protect the integrity of their works. Both rights are conventionally granted to human and legal entities. However, the massive advancement of AI challenges the essential presumption that technology is merely a device in the hands of humans in the creation process of Work. This paper examines several legal issues and problems concerning the economic and moral rights of AI-generated works using the juridical normative approach from the perspective of Indonesian Copyright Law. The result shows that the framework of Indonesia's copyright law is based on the principle of human authorship, therefore, moral rights can only be granted to human(s) and economic rights can only be granted to legal subjects acknowledged by Indonesian Law: human and legal entity. Although the authorship and ownership of AI for copyrighted work is contentious under Indonesian Laws, the limited legal personality of AI could potentially artifice as the preventive measures on several problems concerning legal standing by enabling legal subject (human or legal entity) to act behalf of AI to exercise their rights and obligation both based on regulative approach and procedural approach.},

Driven by the “disruptive technology revolution” in different fields, AI is reshaping knowledge acquisition, teaching and learning, from personalized learning systems to the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the traditional “factory” mode of education is difficult to adapt to personalized learning development needs. Learning development needs, and artificial intelligence-driven systems in support of adaptive learning, intelligent tutoring and automatic assessment, in addition to greatly improve the learning efficiency “liberation of productivity”, but also to change the way of knowledge transfer, affect human cognition and independent learning. It is foreseeable that the competition for education in the age of artificial intelligence may shift from knowledge accumulation to computational power domination. That is to say, individuals with more computing power will have access to better learning resources, which will definitely increase the “digital education gap” on the other hand. This paper analyzes the current situation, challenges, and future trends of AI in education, and explores the impact of AI on self-directed learning, cognitive processes, and the possible evolution of education towards computational competitiveness. Using research methods such as literature review, case study, and technology trend prediction, this study combines the theories of cognitive science, philosophy of AI, and pedagogy to assess the educational impact of AI and propose policy recommendations to promote equity and optimize AI cooperation.},

  abstract = {Emotional recognition can help machines to capture the emotional state of human beings, which is an indispensable technology for human-computer interaction and the realization of artificial intelligence. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been applied to emotion recognition due to its good temporal and spatial resolution. How to capture the correlation of long-distance time-series EEG signal data from both temporal and spatial dimensions and directly affect the effect of emotion recognition is a difficulty in the BCI research. Transformer model can extract long-term correlations of time-series signals. In this paper, a new electroencephalogram emotion recognition method based on spatiotemporal fusion Vision Transformer is proposed. The feature of EEG signals is reconstructed by the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) method. The spatiotemporal correlation between the acquisition channel and the temporal signal is established by position coding for the convolved features. The hybrid model of multiscale convolutional and Vision Transformer (MC-ViT) is utilized for feature extraction and emotion classification. The EEG emotion recognition method based on spatio-temporal fusion vision transformer proposed in this paper has achieved good EEG emotion classification effect on the SEED dataset, which outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods.},

  abstract = {Simulation-based testing is widely used to assess the reliability of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), but its effectiveness is limited by the operational design domain (ODD) conditions available in such simulators. To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then performed system-level testing to evaluate the ability of the ADS to generalize to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help to increase the coverage of ODD for system-level ADS testing. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3\%, retaining the correctness and quality of the images generated for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing.},

The study observes and then designs for intangible affordances supporting this memory recall using the photo-elicitation method with generative artificial intelligence imagery. Specifically, collaboration was observed when editing a panoramic photograph using generative artificial intelligence. These instances were rare, and were analyzed to highlight intangible affordances aiding collaborative memory recall and content creation. Afterward, five examples were correlated to influence the design of an immersive and responsive 360° theatre system using specific combinations of artificial intelligence models to aid subjective recall. In this immersive space, storyteller preferences for edited content are finally made available for new users, thereby affording new collaborative storytelling about a cultural heritage site. As a contribution, this study aids the work of designers and sociologists by showing the photo-elicitation method’s crossdisciplinary relevance to designing for collaborative, yet intangible storytelling affordances.},

  abstract = {This paper first conducts a regression analysis on the direct effect of artificial intelligence on the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry, and then uses the panel threshold model to explore the threshold effect of artificial intelligence on the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. The Hausman test confirms the rationality of the fixed effect regression model, indicating that artificial intelligence has a significant positive impact on the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. Subsequently, the panel threshold model is used for analysis, and it is found that there is a double threshold effect, with the first threshold value being 6.5575 and the second being 14.4800. The marginal effect of the improvement of artificial intelligence level on high-quality development shows a rapid increase at first, a slowdown after crossing the first threshold, and an acceleration again after crossing the second threshold. This nonlinear relationship is further verified through the adjustment ratio change and internal validity test for robustness. The results show that high-end and low-end manufacturing enterprises are more likely to benefit from artificial intelligence technology due to advantages in cost-effectiveness, market demand, and technological adaptability, thereby promoting their high-quality development. In contrast, mid-range manufacturing enterprises may face a series of challenges, resulting in less significant or even inhibitory effects of artificial intelligence technology on them.},

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a model called GC-DMRec. This model combines global context with gated slot attention mechanisms, effectively integrating local session graphs with global context graphs to track item changes both within and across sessions. By using gated slot attention, GC-DMRec focuses on critical time points, extracting more representative features while reducing noise. Experimental results on datasets such as Diginetica, Tmall, and Nowplaying demonstrate that GC-DMRec outperforms other existing methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners. It is frequently used to address major security problems such as supply chain attacks, ransomware threats, and social engineering. In this context, integrating AI into cybersecurity workflows requires incorporating AI-driven approaches into the educational training of the cybersecurity workforce. This paradigm shift in academic settings will introduce the necessary skills for cybersecurity professionals to operate modern AI-based systems. Yet, the current cybersecurity curriculum still suffers from the absence of AI resources, particularly the detailed understanding of the appropriate AI mechanisms. Such absence leaves skill gaps for future professionals and practitioners in the industry. To address this, we designed an academic lecture module on AI covering both theory and practice. Then, we taught the module across six cybersecurity courses in our institution. To assess the effectiveness of integrating AI materials into cybersecurity education, we collected data by presenting two surveys before and after the lecture (concluding 81 participants per survey). Specifically, we utilized widely accepted models for unbiased analysis of our data. Our experimental results show positive AI knowledge improvement by 30\% of the participants, demonstrating the beneficial impact of the lecture. Then, we observed a high similarity score between the survey responses and the lecture content, reaching 84\%. Moreover, our sentiment analysis results reflect positive feedback from the participants with a positive score of 0.50. Overall, our study serves as a reference for instructional designers for developing educational curricula aiming to integrate AI into cybersecurity education.},

In this work, we incorporate feedback provided by artificial intelligence (AI) models instead of relying entirely on human feedback. We propose a simulation optimization framework to train the language model. The objective function for training is approximated using feedback from both human and AI models. We employ the method of control variate to reduce the variance of the approximated objective function. Additionally, we provide a procedure for deciding the sample size to acquire preferences from both human and AI models.

This paper aims to explore how generative AI can enhance user experience by augmenting graphic art style game design. Through the study of design theories, those theories that have a strong influence on graphic art style games are identified. Next, the paper proposes a generative AI-based game design method that combines prompts confirmation, the setting of generated images, and user feedback optimization, aiming to enhance the aesthetic quality and interactivity of the game. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, this paper designs and implements an interview method and a questionnaire to collect data and find out the user experience of generative AI-generated graphic art style games. The experimental results show that generative AI not only significantly improves the efficiency of game design, but also allows for innovative graphics and element design. The findings of this paper provide new perspectives and methods for the application of AI in future game design and also lay the foundation for further exploring the potential of generative AI in other art style games.},

The model built by partial least squares (PLS) and reconstructed spectra is used to predict the SSC of pears with a Rp2 of 0.668 and EMSEp of 0.366. The experimental results show that increasing the input channels can improve the reconstruction quality of the SSR model, and the reasonable selection of output channels helps to remove the redundant information and realize the accurate prediction of SSC, which illustrated that the importance of rationally selecting the input channels of the SSR model as well as the output channels to the SSR results.},

This paper focuses on the study of factors affecting design behavior in the view of artificial intelligence, aiming to analyze the weight of each influencing factor accurately. Through the hierarchical analysis method (AHP), its advantage of quantitative subjective judgment is brought into play, and experts' subjective perception of the importance of design behavior factors is deeply explored. At the same time, combined with the entropy weight method, the weights are determined based on the objective information entropy of the data, which effectively makes up for the lack of subjective assignment. Using the AHP-entropy weight method combined with these two methods, a comprehensive and systematic weight evaluation of design behavior factors is carried out to improve the efficiency of multi-attribute decision-making.},

A study investigating students' attitudes toward these tools was conducted during an Introduction to Computer Science course. The target of the study was to gauge students' evolving attitudes toward using GenAI tools in the course, before, during and after ChatGPT was gradually assimilated into homework assignments. The study refers to three phases: preliminary phase, assimilation phase, and calibration stage, which currently takes place. Findings show that, in the preliminary phase, students appreciated the efficiency of GenAI tools offered but were concerned about developing a dependency on these tools and about ''cheating''. Findings from the assimilation phase indicate that consistent, guided exposure to GenAI tools positively shifted students' views, alleviating initial concerns and promoting a positive attitude toward using GenAI tools in the course. The targets of the calibration phase are: a) to examine how to leverage independent learning by formulating clear guidelines that can build trust in the technology and help overcome concerns regarding reliability and credibility; b) to check how GenAI can help students in a Introduction to Computer Science course acquire skills such as critical thinking and code comprehension. The study offers insights for educators on the integration of GenAI tools into computer science courses to enhance learning while maintaining academic integrity.},

The results show that: The difference between supervision cost and non-supervision cost of universities, and the difference between high-quality R&amp;D cost and low-quality R&amp;D cost of enterprises are the key factors affecting the evolutionarily stable strategies of universities and enterprises respectively; Strengthening supervision of AI projects by government departments and all sectors of society can effectively promote supervision of universities and high-quality R&amp;D of enterprises; It is also an effective incentive method for universities to appropriately increase the government incentives allocated to enterprises.},

Recent research has found that college students are increasingly using GenAI tools; however, we know less about when, why, and how they choose to hide or disclose their use of GenAI in academic work. To address this gap, we conducted an online survey (n=97) and interviews with fifteen college students followed by interviews with nine teachers who had experience with students’ undisclosed use of GenAI. Our findings elucidate the strategies students employ to hide their GenAI use and their justifications for doing so, alongside the strategies teachers follow to manage such non-disclosure. We unpack students’ non-disclosure of GenAI through the lens of cognitive dissonance and discuss practical considerations for teachers and students regarding ways to promote transparency in GenAI use in higher education.},

Existing solutions for trace reconstruction often fail to fully leverage available data, particularly in complex and high-dimensional contexts. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence, particularly diffusion models, have set new benchmarks in image, audio, and natural language generation. This study conducts the first comprehensive evaluation of diffusion models for reconstructing incomplete trace event sequences. Using nine distinct datasets generated from the Phoronix Test Suite, we rigorously test these models on sequences of varying lengths and missing data ratios. Our results indicate that the SSSDS4 model, in particular, achieves superior performance, in terms of accuracy, perfect rate, and ROUGE-L score across diverse imputation scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of diffusion-based models to accurately reconstruct missing events, thereby maintaining data integrity and enhancing system monitoring and analysis.},

In this paper, we contribute the design and implementation of a smartphone-based chatbot that detects artwork, generates textual and auditory information, and interactively answers visitors’ questions. To explore visitors’ experience with it, we conducted a field experiment (N=30) at the National Art Museum, comparing it to the existing museum application. Our results indicate that visitors showed higher artwork engagement with the chatbot than the museum application. Moreover, they enjoyed an interactive experience using the chatbot to learn about the art collection and have equally preferred textual and auditory information representation.},

  abstract = {The continuous development of artificial intelligence (AI) theory has propelled this field to unprecedented heights, owing to the relentless efforts of scholars and researchers. In the medical realm, AI takes a pivotal role, leveraging robust machine learning (ML) algorithms. AI technology in medical imaging aids physicians in X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnoses, conducts pattern recognition and disease prediction based on acoustic data, delivers prognoses on disease types and developmental trends for patients, and employs intelligent health management wearable devices with human-computer interaction technology to name but a few. While these well-established applications have significantly assisted in medical field diagnoses, clinical decision-making, and management, collaboration between the medical and AI sectors faces an urgent challenge: How to substantiate the reliability of decision-making? The underlying issue stems from the conflict between the demand for accountability and result transparency in medical scenarios and the black-box model traits of AI. This article reviews recent research grounded in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), with an emphasis on medical practices within the visual, audio, and multimodal perspectives. We endeavor to categorize and synthesize these practices, aiming to provide support and guidance for future researchers and healthcare professionals.},

  abstract = {In recent years, with the development of science and technology, the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education begin to increase. Many well-known universities in China have stepped up their pace and actively explored the deep integration of "artificial intelligence + education". A series of innovative practices, such as intelligent teaching system, intelligent classroom, virtual teaching assistant and personalized learning platform, all show that the education industry is undergoing an unprecedented intelligent transformation. But at the same time, the application of artificial intelligence in the teaching process in colleges and universities is not mature, and there are still many problems. In this context, it has become very urgent to explore how to efficiently use artificial intelligence technology to contribute to the higher education in China. This paper introduces the development process of AI and its application in colleges and universities, then analyzes the obstacles of AI when applied in higher education, and finally proposes specific application strategies for artificial intelligence to empower new teaching and learning models in universities. It is hoped that the research of this paper can improve the application of artificial intelligence in the teaching of universities in China.},

  abstract = {I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Human-Centered Computing at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, under the advisement of Dr. Foad Hamidi. My research is focused on the use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Special Education to help create more equitable learning environments for learners with disabilities. I hope to propose my dissertation studies plan by the end of August 2025. I will continue my research and plan to defend my dissertation in 2026. After I defend my dissertation, I would like to transition to a career in academia or work in a research lab. My dissertation is at the intersection of AI, Human-Computer Interaction, and inclusive education through the lens of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) [1]. Specifically, I am investigating how generative AI tools [2], such as large language models, can support special educators in designing accessible and personalized learning experiences for students with disabilities [4]. Previously, I contributed to research on DIY assistive technologies [3]. The first phase of my research included a qualitative interview study examining how K-12 special educators use and perceive AI. Findings highlighted opportunities and challenges of the use of AI. Concerns included lack of professional development, bias in AI, accessibility, and privacy issues. In the second phase, I conducted a focus group with special educators to understand how they have been using generative AI. I also conducted a participatory design session with one participant to discuss the design of an AI-enhanced tool they would like. These sessions provided an understanding of special educator experiences using AI to support neurodiverse learners. In the next phase of my research, I plan to conduct a qualitative study to understand how generative AI can assist parents and students in developing self-advocacy skills and in the creation of goals for their Individualized Education Plan (IEP) [5]. The study aims to understand experiences, perceptions, and needs of parents and students when using generative AI tools for self-advocacy.},

  abstract = {While generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is finding increased adoption in workplaces, current tools are primarily designed for individual use. Prior work established the potential for these tools to enhance personal creativity and productivity towards shared goals; however, we don't know yet how to best take into account the nuances of group work and team dynamics when deploying GenAI in work settings. In this paper, we investigate the potential of collaborative GenAI agents to augment teamwork in synchronous group settings through an exploratory study that engaged 25 professionals across 6 teams in speculative design workshops and individual follow-up interviews. Our workshops included a mixed reality provotype to simulate embodied collaborative GenAI agents capable of actively participating in group discussions. Our findings suggest that, if designed well, collaborative GenAI agents offer valuable opportunities to enhance team problem-solving by challenging groupthink, bridging communication gaps, and reducing social friction. However, teams' willingness to integrate GenAI agents depended on its perceived fit across a number of individual, team, and organizational factors. We outline the key design tensions around agent representation, social prominence, and engagement and highlight the opportunities spatial and immersive technologies could offer to modulate GenAI influence on team outcomes and strike a balance between augmentation and agency.},

  abstract = {This poster reports on the differences in perceptions concerning academic dishonesty and the misuse of resources in college from the perspectives of students, teaching assistants (TAs), and instructors in Computer Science (CS). Dishonesty has been a topic of interest in the CS education community, with efforts addressing how to detect and prevent it [1, 2, 6, 7, 8]. With the presence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its increased use in recent years, studying all actors’ perspectives on dishonesty in regard to generative AI becomes critical to promote guidelines and strategies for curricular design in CS [4, 5], aligning those who teach and those who learn towards a common ethical ground. This led us to explore the following research questions with a specific emphasis on artificial intelligence in mind:(1)RQ1: How do students, instructors, and teaching assistants respond to scenarios suggesting academic dishonesty in the CS classroom?(2)RQ2: What reasons do students, instructors, and teaching assistants in CS consider may lead someone toward academic dishonesty in the CS classroom?We surveyed 538 undergraduate students, 21 TAs, and six Computer Science (CS) instructors at a large Southeastern U.S. institution. Students and TAs were part of two undergraduate CS courses. Responses were gathered via an online questionnaire that featured 13 multiple-choice questions on whether the participant thought particular situations fell most closely within “serious cheating,” “trivial cheating,” or “no cheating”–questions adapted from the work by Ozment et al. [3]; one open-ended question on the reasons the participant considered why someone might cheat in the CS classroom; and demographic questions. This poster focuses specifically on participants’ responses to the open-ended question, via a thematic analysis to identify recurring categories (i.e., themes) and assess the affinity of participants’ responses within each theme. Subgroups were participants’ demographics and backgrounds.Our findings suggest that all participants have diverse perspectives. Instructors generally referred to "Grade Pressure" and "Laziness" as the top two reasons behind dishonesty, while TAs and students emphasized "Prerequisite Knowledge" and "Time Management" as the main contributing factors. These findings suggest a dichotomy among actors involved in the learning processes happening in the CS classroom.Our work underscores the need for awareness and support strategies in curricular initiatives within the CS Ed community to help prevent dishonesty and promote student success in their computing disciplines. A clear disconnect between instructor expectations and student perceptions encourages clearer communication in the classroom and is a ripe avenue for further study.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has significantly increased the sophistication and ease of image tampering techniques, posing challenges for digital forensics in identifying manipulated images. A lack of dataset standardisation hinders the ability to effectively benchmark and compare GenAI inpainting localisation techniques, reducing their reliability in digital forensic applications. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring the need for standardised criteria for datasets in digital forensics for benchmarking detection techniques through preliminary experiments.To address the limited diversity in existing datasets, a small-scale dataset was developed, consisting of 240 tampered images, 20 masks and 20 authentic images. This dataset includes four subject image classes (animals, objects, persons, scenery) and three inpainting tools (GLIDE, GalaxyAI, Photoshop). The dataset was evaluated against 13 localisation algorithms from the Image Forensics MATLAB Toolbox to determine key components that should be considered in the standardisation of testing environments.The results show that the images in the animals and persons categories achieved the highest F1-Scores and accuracy over the other classes. Among tools, GLIDE inpainted images were consistently shown to be the most challenging to detect, underscoring the importance of further investigating these images. These findings provide foundational insights for identifying a set of criteria to establish robust testing environments, enabling the development of reliable and accurate GenAI inpainting localisation techniques.},

This study discusses seven strategic factors, including policy guarantee, stakeholder collaboration, financial capability, and public demands, information security, data availability, and AI infrastructure, and identifies their configurations which lead to a high smart city performance via the adoption of AI. A theoretical model is developed to understand smart city practice in 31 capital cities in the mainland of China. The findings reveal the complexity of AI adoption in smart cities from a configurational perspective and indicate that these factors do not work in isolation, but in combination with others to promote AI adoption in smart cities. Understanding the configurational relationships of these factors can help smart city strategists in their planning and policymaking relating to the development of smart cities.},

After the session, students wrote a quiz without assistance to evaluate their newly acquired knowledge. A survey was then administered to collect student perceptions and analyze their interactions with the AI tutor. The preliminary findings suggest that GenAI tutors can effectively support learning, with most students preferring AI over human tutors due to convenience, accessibility, and stress-free environment. While variability of prompt effectiveness and students' misuse or overreliance on AI highlight areas were observed, these results highlight avenues for future research to refine GenAI strategies and improve student learning.},

Emerging AI tools, such as generative AI, can help people understand contexts where they lack subject expertise. This work explores how university Disability Services Office (DSO) professionals write alt text for scientific figures without subject expertise. We conducted a user study with 12 DSO professionals who authored alt text for scientific figures, first without and then using generative AI. We assessed the participants’ processes for alt text generation and their confidence in the resulting output. We also conducted semi-structured interviews to understand DSO professionals’ experiences with the alt text generation. Our findings reveal that AI assistance improved participants’ confidence and efficiency, but introduced new challenges for interaction and trust. Participants expressed caution about relying on AI-generated descriptions without sufficient domain knowledge and editing. These insights highlight the need for AI-augmented tools that better scaffold the alt text writing process for accessibility professionals.},

Since such models will be integrated into future educational tools, a human-centered design approach that takes students’ perspectives into account is essential while designing such applications.This paper describes two co-design workshops which were conducted with 79 student groups to examine how they design and prototype future educational tools integrated with MLLMs. Through various activities in the workshops, students discussed relevant educational problems, created journey maps, storyboards and low fidelity prototypes for their applications, and evaluated their applications based on relevant design principles. We found that students’ applications used MLLMs for important learning environment design features such as multimodal content creation, personalization, and feedback. Based on these findings, we discuss future research directions for the design of multimodality in generative AI educational applications.},

Through a workshop-focused group discussion, we discussed the perception, ideas, and concerns for introducing generative AI technology to tribal communities to increase disaster resilience. Our findings suggest considerations about developing strategies and possible governance models when introducing LLM-based models to marginalized local communities with limited resources. This research contributes to literature of the potential and limitations of AI in supporting disaster preparedness and response within indigenous communities, ultimately informing strategies for enhanced tribal disaster resilience and sustainable development goals.},

However, deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals remain largely excluded from these developments. This study explores how music GenAI could enhance the music-making experience of DHH individuals, who often rely on hearing people to translate sounds and music. We developed a multimodal music-making assistive tool informed by focus group interviews. This tool enables DHH users to create and edit music independently through language interaction with music GenAI, supported by integrated visual and tactile feedback. Our findings from the music-making study revealed that the system empowers them to engage in independent and proactive music-making activities, increasing their confidence, fostering musical expression, and positively shifting their attitudes toward music. Contributing to inclusive art by preserving the unique sensory characteristics of DHH individuals, this study demonstrates how music GenAI can benefit a marginalized community, fostering independent creative expression.},

This study introduces a four-phase field study, involving in total two experienced K-6 art teachers and 132 students in eight offline course sessions, to investigate the usage and impact of GenAI. Specifically, based on findings in Phases 1 and 2, we developed AskArt, an interactive interface that combines DALL-E and GPT and is tailored to support elementary school students in their art projects, and deployed it in Phases 3 and 4. Our findings revealed the benefits of GenAI in providing background information, inspirations, and personalized guidance. However, challenges in query formulation for generating expected content were also observed. Moreover, students employed varied collaboration strategies, and teachers noted increased engagement alongside concerns regarding misuse and interface suitability. This study offers insights into the effective integration of GenAI in elementary education, presents AskArt as a practical tool, and provides recommendations for educators and researchers to enhance project-based learning with GenAI technologies.},

However, granular and real-time data on labor market trends are lacking; publicly available data from survey samples are released with significant lags and miss critical information such as skills and benefits. We use generative Artificial Intelligence to automatically extract structured labor market information from unstructured online job postings for the entire U.S. labor market. To demonstrate our methodology, we construct a sample of 6,800 job postings stratified by 68 major occupational groups, extract structured information on educational requirements, remote-work flexibility, full-time availability, and benefits, and show how these job characteristics vary across occupations. As a validation, we compare frequencies of educational requirements by occupation from our sample to survey data and find no statistically significant difference. Finally, we discuss the scalability to collections of millions of job postings. Our results establish the feasibility of measuring labor market trends at scale from online job postings thanks to advances in generative AI techniques. Improved access to such insights at scale and in real-time could transform the ability of policy leaders, including federal and state agencies and education providers, to make data-informed decisions that better support the American workforce.},

  abstract = {The adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) in society and business is growing rapidly. While these systems often generate convincing and coherent responses, they risk producing incorrect or non-factual information, known as confabulations or hallucinations. Consequently, users must critically assess the reliability of these outputs when interacting with LLM-based agents. Although advancements such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have improved the technical performance of these systems, there is a lack of empirical models that explain how humans detect confabulations. Building on the explainable AI (XAI) literature, we examine the role of reasoning-based explanations in helping users identify confabulations in LLM systems. An online experiment (n = 97) reveals that analogical and factual explanations improve detection accuracy but require more time and cognitive effort than the no explanation baseline.},

  abstract = {The industrial application of artificial intelligence technology is profoundly changing the competitive pattern of enterprises. However, small and medium-sized enterprises generally face bottlenecks such as high investment threshold, lack of talents and difficult scene adaptation in the process of technology landing. This study focuses on the feasibility discrimination problem of enterprise application of artificial intelligence technology, and proposes a deep learning framework based on LSTM-Transformer hybrid model. By integrating the three types of time series characteristics of enterprise basic information, business dynamics and technology application data, a multi-dimensional evaluation system is constructed. The model adopts layered architecture: LSTM layer captures short-term business fluctuations, Transformer layer mines long-term correlation between technical input and business effectiveness, and finally realizes two-classification of "feasible" and "temporarily infeasible" through Softmax. Based on the six-year data of 2006 enterprises, the mixed model accuracy reached 89.06\% (±0.31\%) and F1 score was 87.88\% (±0.36\%), which was significantly better than the single model and CNN-LSTM baseline. Confusion matrix shows that 93.7\% of high recall guarantees the identification of potential enterprises, and 74.4\% of specificity reveals negative class discrimination optimization space. This study provides a data-driven decision-making tool for SMEs to avoid technology investment risks.},

To aid in this effort, we designed an open-ended generative AI project for the freshmen taking our general-education introduction to computing course. Students were required to team with generative AI to create something beyond what they alone (or the AI alone) could accomplish. Upon completion, students submitted a short written critical analysis documenting their experiences and presented a three-minute demonstration of their project in class. Despite limited course coverage of AI and generative AI prior to this project, we were impressed by the creativity and sophistication of the submitted final products as well as the breadth of generative AI tools explored. Student reflections on the experience illustrated numerous insights into the strengths and limitations of the tools they employed. Our results underscore that students can learn about the benefits and limitations of generative AI in as little as a single assignment and that covering such topics need not require extensive amounts of course time and resources.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offers numerous opportunities to revolutionise teaching and learning in Computing Education (CE). However, educators have expressed concerns that students may over-rely on GenAI and use these tools to generate solutions without engaging in the learning process. While substantial research has explored GenAI use in CE, and many Computer Science (CS) educators have expressed their opinions and suggestions on the subject, there remains little consensus on implementing curricula and assessment changes.In this paper, we describe our experiences with using GenAI in CS-focused educational settings and the changes we have implemented accordingly in our teaching in recent years since the popularisation of GenAI. From our experiences, we propose two primary actions for the CE community: 1) redesign take-home assignments to incorporate GenAI use and assess students on their process of using GenAI to solve a task rather than simply on the final product; 2) redefine the role of educators to emphasise metacognitive aspects of learning, such as critical thinking and self-evaluation. This paper presents and discusses these stances and outlines several practical methods to implement these strategies in CS classrooms. Then, we advocate for more research addressing the concrete impacts of GenAI on CE, especially those evaluating the validity and effectiveness of new teaching practices.},

  abstract = {While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various general tasks, developing domain-specific model remains an urgent need. This requires fine-tuning with high-quality data. Extraction of question-answer (QA) pairs from domain knowledge documents is a crucial prerequisite for fine-tuning, especially when these documents containing complex charts and unstructured data. This paper introduces a framework for extracting QA pairs from charts, which combines OCR and VLM to fully leverage contextual information in the documents and generate deep, contextually relevant questions. Our method first uses OCR for initial chart recognition, followed by a VLM-based “Caption-Reflection'' paradigm to reduce misrecognition. We then design a context localization module which combines local and global contexts to generate relevant QA pairs. Additionally, we construct a specialized chart knowledge base to guide the generation of QA pairs. Experimental results show significant improvement in both chart recognition performance and QA pairs generation quality: the average precision increases from 0.52 to 0.90, the average F1 Score improves from 0.64 to 0.94, the average FPR decreases from 0.55 to 0 respectively. The generated QA pairs perform well in terms of statistical relevance and contextual consistency.},

  abstract = {In this third installment of our GenAI workshop series at DIS, we focus on ‘stopsigns’—the blockages that impede progress in design research with GenAI. These stopsigns manifest as both semantic barriers (political, social, or mental frameworks) and pragmatic hurdles (technical limitations or implementation challenges) that persist despite the rapid advancements since the GenAI boom. Such stopsigns present a productive tension—they often contain partial truths worthy of consideration while simultaneously being shortsighted in ways that prevent progression. From blanket rejection to uncritical acceptance, these barriers affect how meaningfully we engage with GenAI’s potential. Our workshop welcomes both returning and first-time participants to share their experiences with these persistent challenges and work together to develop practical solutions. Through analysis of real cases and hands-on activities, we’ll build strategies for moving beyond these obstacles while acknowledging their legitimate concerns. Our goal is to foster more thoughtful integration of GenAI in design research and practice.},

GAEs have specialized domain expertise, perform tasks within bounded autonomy, include a synthetic persona and possess multimodal generative AI capabilities, among other features. We provide a definition of GAEs which includes seven defining traits, offering a taxonomy which sets them apart from other generative AI systems. We use literature-review based conceptual analysis with abductive reasoning to propose the new concept that addresses identified limitations in existing systems. The paper explores the emergence of GAEs as a leap from expert systems. We name two enablers for GAEs - ongoing development of a research field of human-AI collaboration and growing capabilities of generative artificial intelligence systems. We discuss existing generative AI agents, noting that GAEs as such do not exist yet, but are starting to emerge. Due conceptual nature of this paper we do not explore the technical aspects of GAEs development. Instead, we use illustrative examples to present possible applications of GAEs and their potential role in the future of knowledge work. This article appears in the AI \&amp; Society track.},

  abstract = {Designing public spaces requires balancing the interests of diverse stakeholders within a constrained physical and institutional space. Designers usually approach these problems through participatory methods but struggle to incorporate diverse perspectives into design outputs. The growing capabilities of image-generative artificial intelligence (IGAI) could support participatory design. Prior work in leveraging IGAI's capabilities in design has focused on augmenting the experience and performance of individual creators. We study how IGAI could facilitate participatory processes when designing public spaces, a complex collaborative task. We conducted workshops and IGAI-mediated interviews in a real-world participatory process to upgrade a park in Los Angeles. We found (1) a shift from focusing on accuracy to fostering richer conversations as the desirable outcome of adopting IGAI in participatory design, (2) that IGAI promoted more space-aware conversations, and (3) that IGAI-mediated conversations are subject to the abilities of the facilitators in managing the interaction between themselves, the AI, and stakeholders. We contribute by discussing practical implications for using IGAI in participatory design, including success metrics, relevant skills, and asymmetries between designers and stakeholders. We finish by proposing a series of open research questions.},

  abstract = {Eye-tracking technology is increasingly integrated into smart glasses and wearable devices, becoming more prevalent in daily life. Meanwhile, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the potential to transform user experiences through personalization and adaptive interactions. The integration of these technologies offers a novel opportunity to refine GenAI models by leveraging human gaze data in adaptive interfaces, personalized content generation, and human-computer interaction. However, gaze data is highly sensitive and can reveal several user attributes, such as cognitive states, emotions, and even medical conditions. Therefore, the use of gaze data to inform GenAI models raises significant privacy concerns. Hence, in this paper, we highlight the implications of using eye gaze information in GenAI models with privacy and societal considerations and discuss strategies to mitigate potential privacy violations. By addressing these issues, we can ensure a trade-off between technological advancements and privacy protection.},

  abstract = {Information Retrieval (IR) systems are crucial tools for users to access information, which have long been dominated by traditional methods relying on similarity matching. With the advancement of pre-trained language models, Generative Information Retrieval (GenIR) emerges as a novel paradigm, attracting increasing attention. Based on the form of information provided to users, current research in GenIR can be categorized into two aspects: (1) Generative Retrieval (GR) leverages the generative model’s parameters for memorizing documents, enabling retrieval by directly generating relevant document identifiers without explicit indexing. (2) Reliable Response Generation employs language models to directly generate information users seek, breaking the limitations of traditional IR in terms of document granularity and relevance matching while offering flexibility, efficiency, and creativity to meet practical needs. This article aims to systematically review the latest research progress in GenIR. We will summarize the advancements in GR regarding model training and structure, document identifier, incremental learning, and so on, as well as progress in reliable response generation in aspects of internal knowledge memorization, external knowledge augmentation, and so on. We also review the evaluation, challenges, and future developments in GenIR systems. This review aims to offer a comprehensive reference for researchers, encouraging further development in the GenIR field (Github Repository: ).},

  abstract = {For decades, scholars have emphasized that tasks should be the central focus in Information Retrieval (IR). This point of view holds even more significance with the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, which can, among other capabilities, understand natural language, engage in dialog with users, generate bespoke user interfaces, and power agents to help complete tasks. GenAI presents an unprecedented opportunity to finally realize the potential of tasks in IR, enhance task-focused retrieval and interaction, and create ''magical'' task completion moments for users. In this paper, we explore the rationale and methodology behind this argument. Traditional IR systems support mostly simple tasks. The emergence of GenAI creates an opportunity for IR systems to help users achieve complex tasks and for the IR community to rekindle its interest and demonstrate leadership in this sizable and significant problem space. We underscore the pivotal role of tasks in IR and introduce new evidence supporting the notion that task-centric approaches, abstracted from specific modalities, represent the future of IR. Building on this foundation, we envision the development, utilization, and evaluation of next-generation IR systems. We propose a promising future where IR agents prioritize users, their tasks, and their situations. However, despite their potential to address task-focused and modality-independent IR, agents alone are insufficient. We propose a robust ecosystem around these agents that transcends traditional queries, questions, prompts, and modalities to address users' fundamental needs, tasks, and goals.},

Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence&nbsp;(GAI) and extended reality&nbsp;(XR) provided new solutions for rapid prototype transition and mixed simulation. We conducted a formative study to understand current challenges in the traditional prototype process and explore how to effectively utilize GAI and XR ability in prototype. Then we introduced FusionProtor, a mixed-prototype tool for component-level 3D prototype transition and simulation. We proposed a step-by-step generation pipeline in FusionProtor, effectively transiting 3D prototypes from physical to virtual and low- to high-fidelity for rapid ideation and iteration. We also innovated a component-level 3D creation method and applied it in XR environment for the mixed-prototype presentation and interaction. We conducted technical and user experiments to verify FusionProtor’s usability in supporting diverse designs. Our results verified that it achieved a seamless workflow between physical and virtual domains, enhancing efficiency and promoting ideation. We also explored the effect of mixed interaction on design and critically discussed its best practices for HCI community.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence has a powerful database and language generation function, which can be used as an extension of the human brain to a certain extent. Its application in the field of education has brought about a double-sided effect. On the one hand, AI promotes the great enrichment of material and spiritual wealth and makes it possible to liberate people's hands, which are the basis and conditions for human's freedom and all-round development. On the other hand, AI also brings some hidden worries to education: reshaping people's values, exacerbating the gap in educational resources, and triggering ethical controversies. Based on the Marxist theory on the freedom and comprehensive development of human beings, this paper focuses on the hidden worries of future education under the influence of artificial intelligence to explore the reform paths of future education. The reform paths including establishing correct value concepts to correctly understand the value of education; focusing on independent and diversified learning to cultivate students’ ability of independent critical thinking; breaking down technological barriers to build a technology development platform and share AI technology; sounding ethical rules as well as strengthening institutional regulations and technological protection support to shape the concept of science and technology for good and enhance people's awareness of digital security and self-protection. Promoting future education's reformation in the age of artificial intelligence with correct values, fair educational resources and sound ethical rules can play a good role in educating and cultivating autonomous, diversified and comprehensive new-age talents.},

  abstract = {This research explores the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into immersive, site-specific theater through a collaborative initiative between Moment Factory and Third Rail Projects. The objective was to investigate how GenAI technologies can augment dramaturgical practices by enabling co-creation among authors, performers, and audience members.Using an iterative research-creation methodology, the project unfolded in two phases: a remote prototyping cycle and an on-site laboratory. Across three use cases: generative scenography, physical space extension, and improvised narration—AI tools were integrated into live performance contexts to dynamically respond to human presence and input. Techniques included the use of real-time generative visuals, silhouette-based transformations, and voice-activated storytelling systems.The findings highlight both the creative opportunities and technical constraints of employing GenAI in live performance. Critical insights emerged around timing, audience perception, system orchestration, and the need for adaptable, artist-centric AI workflows. This study emphasizes the potential of GenAI to function not merely as a technical instrument, but as a dramaturgical collaborator in the creation of emotionally resonant, participatory experiences.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence is taking the world by storm. It's a new technology that enables computers learn from historical data to generate new content that feels original and human-like. Although generative AI has become a part of everyday life, many people still lack a clear understanding of how it works. Without a solid understanding of generative AI, it can be difficult for individuals to fully embrace this emerging technology. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the concepts, technologies, and real-world impact of generative AI.The course begins with a historical overview of artificial intelligence that traces its evolution from early rules-based logic to the deep learning breakthroughs that have enabled today's most powerful generative AI models. Participants will explore foundational concepts that include illustrations of neural network models to gain intuition behind how machines learn to generate text, images, and other types of content. The course delves into practical applications of generative AI across multiple modalities, including natural language, computer vision, audio, and more. Participants will also study high-level system architectures of an AI chatbot, the poster child of generative AI, to understand how these systems operate. Finally, the course will examine future development of generative AI, including the rise of agentic applications that can reason, plan, and interact autonomously.},

  abstract = {The rapid progression of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has raised significant interest and concern in academia. Instances of students submitting AI-generated assignments prompt investigations into implications for teaching, learning, and academic integrity. Recent publications highlight concerns such as a lack of conceptual understanding, threats to academic integrity, and disruptions to traditional assessment methods. While recognizing benefits like automated scoring and personalized learning, authors stress the responsible use of GenAI, emphasizing the educator's role in guiding students. This commentary identifies opportunities and threats of GenAI in African university contexts. Opportunities include increased operational efficiency, content generation, automated assessment, recognition of accessibility needs, overcoming language barriers, and accelerated research. However, these tools require human correction and cautious consideration of job displacement concerns. Threats encompass job displacement, privacy and security issues, threats to academic integrity, hallucinations/confabulations of GenAI, access and infrastructure challenges, technological overemphasis, lack of customization for local needs and cultural contexts, dependency on external providers, and unaffordable costs. The need for robust guidelines that balance technological advances with traditional teaching methods in African universities is emphasized. Given digital transformation initiatives like the African Union's Agenda 2063 and Botswana's SmartBots strategy, integrating GenAI could shape the future of African tertiary education. Proactive policies should address ethical concerns, ensure access, and make GenAI tools available, requiring a collaborative effort to navigate its impact responsibly.},

  abstract = {Despite recent advances in understanding the capabilities and limits of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, we are just beginning to understand their capacity to assess and reason about the veracity of content. We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and “hard” criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.},

However, the digital transformation of holistic and structured creative learning processes in museum education remains largely underexplored. Although Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) holds promise for supporting creative learning, its full integration across all phases in non-formal education settings like museums remains limited. In this work, we designed Mariscope, a GenAI-supported creative learning platform for marine museum education. By integrating GenAI with the five stages of the iterative creative learning path, Mariscope offers a personalized and dynamic learning experience. A preliminary study with four participants demonstrated positive impacts on learning outcomes and creative self-efficacy, showcasing the platform’s potential for enhancing digital museum education through iterative and interactive creative learning processes.},

  abstract = {This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI), and - among other approaches - particularly to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together.Following successful workshops in 2022–2024, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

Although generative AI agents provide unparalleled capabilities, they also have unique safety concerns. These challenges require robust safeguards, especially for autonomous machines that operate in high-stakes environments. This work investigates the evolving safety requirements when generative models are integrated as agents into physical autonomous machines, comparing these to safety considerations in less critical AI applications. We explore the challenges and opportunities to ensure the safe deployment of generative AI-driven autonomous machines. Furthermore, we provide a forward-looking perspective on the future of AI-driven autonomous systems and emphasize the importance of evaluating and communicating safety risks. As an important step towards addressing these concerns, we recommend the development and implementation of comprehensive safety scorecards for the use of generative AI technologies in autonomous machines.},

  abstract = {Software development activities must adhere to industry, national, and/or international regulatory standards to ensure security, safety, and other important properties in high-stakes, regulated domains, such as healthcare, automotive, and aerospace. These software standards are often codified via multiple documents, ranging from specific requirements to general guidance. Software developers must demonstrate—and regulatory authorities must then verify—the completeness and consistency between the software artifacts and the software regulatory documents. Detecting regulatory document incompleteness, inconsistencies, and/or discrepancies (DIID) with respect to software artifacts is important for both developers and regulators because they indicate potential non-conformance and/or software regulatory risk.DIID detection is currently a human-intensive activity where people learn the standards and then review or search software artifacts to find or detect potential issues. This tedious and error-prone manual process is even more challenging with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that create frequent software updates. In addition, software artifacts (such as requirements or architecture documents) and software standards also change as the software is maintained, requiring ongoing manual reviews and revisions.Generative AI can accelerate DIID detection for different documents and data sources. This paper explores how generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), can accelerate DIID detection in software artifacts, particularly when comparing trusted documents like safety standards with software development artifacts. Integrating LLMs into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to detect DIID can improve specific development activities, as well as enable transformative opportunities by accelerating end-to-end SDLC workflows and regulatory compliance. Current LLM benchmarks and testing frameworks do not sufficiently test for detecting DIID and require extension to adequately and consistently detect DIID across multiple SDLC activities. This position paper describes how LLMs can accelerate software assurance processes and ensure greater compliance with industry standards and government regulatory requirements.},

This concept is further enhanced by generative AI technology, which promises more efficient and accurate AI-driven data generation for network simulation and optimization. This survey provides insights into generative AI-empowered network digital twins. We begin by outlining the architecture of a network digital twin, which encompasses both digital and physical domains. This architecture involves four key steps: data processing and network monitoring, digital replication and network simulation, designing and training network optimizers, Sim2Real, and network control. Next, we systematically discuss the related studies in each step and make a detailed taxonomy of the problem studied, the methods used, and the key designs leveraged. Each step is examined with a focus on the role of generative AI, from estimating missing data and simulating network behaviors to designing control strategies and bridging the gap between digital and physical domains. Finally, we discuss the open issues and challenges of generative AI-based network digital twins.},

  abstract = {Intelligent transportation systems are vital for modern traffic management and optimization, greatly improving traffic efficiency and safety. With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) technologies in areas like image generation and natural language processing, generative AI has also played a crucial role in addressing key issues in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), such as data sparsity, difficulty in observing abnormal scenarios, and in modeling data uncertainty. In this review, we systematically investigate the relevant literature on generative AI techniques in addressing key issues in different types of tasks in ITS tailored specifically for road transportation. First, we introduce the principles of different generative AI techniques. Then, we classify tasks in ITS into four types: traffic perception, traffic prediction, traffic simulation, and traffic decision-making. We systematically illustrate how generative AI techniques addresses key issues in these four different types of tasks. Finally, we summarize the challenges faced in applying generative AI to ITS, and discuss future research directions based on different application scenarios.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated significant potential in clinical reasoning skills such as history-taking and differential diagnosis generation—critical aspects of medical education. This work explores how LLMs can augment medical curricula through interactive learning. We conducted a participatory design process with medical students, residents and medical education experts to co-create an AI-powered tutor prototype for clinical reasoning. As part of the co-design process, we conducted a qualitative user study, investigating learning needs and practices via interviews, and conducting concept evaluations through interactions with the prototype. Findings highlight the challenges learners face in transitioning from theoretical knowledge to practical application, and how an AI tutor can provide personalized practice and feedback. We conclude with design considerations, emphasizing the importance of context-specific knowledge and emulating positive preceptor traits, to guide the development of AI tools for medical education.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to simulate rare disease situations. This is a potential way to train robotic systems, especially for medical actions. It can be hard to get real-world data for training because trends in rare diseases are often complicated, varied, and hard to predict. This can make it time-consuming, expensive, and morally problematic. Generative AI models, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variation Autoencoders (VAEs), can make fake but real medical situations that show how complicated rare diseases are. It is easy to make different datasets with these AI-driven models. These datasets can then be used to train robots so they can do complicated medical treatments more accurately and quickly By adding these AI models to artificial training environments, it is possible to create many rare disease cases that would be hard to make in regular training settings. The models improve robots' abilities to make smart choices, deal with new problems, and guess how patients will do in real time by exposing them to a lot of different situations. Using generative AI also cuts down on the need for real patient data, which protects privacy while still providing the reality needed for effective training. This method not only makes medical robots better at their jobs and more flexible in situations involving rare diseases, but it also makes it easier for them to keep learning. The robots can get better at making decisions by going through virtual situations that get more complicated. In the end, this study looks at how generative AI could be used to make computer systems that are smarter and can react to rare diseases. This would make medical treatments in these specialized fields more accurate and safer.},

  abstract = {Multimodal generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers new affordances for inclusive education, particularly for children with vision impairments (CVIs), by enabling alternate representations that align with non-visual mental models. While GenAI tools are rapidly reshaping mainstream educational practices worldwide, their design and deployment often presume a digitally literate, sighted teaching workforce and well-resourced institutional contexts. In this paper, we address a critical gap in HCI and accessibility research: the near-total absence of empirical studies on teachers with vision impairments (TVIs), who play a central pedagogical role in schools for the blind across the Global South. Through in-depth interviews with 15 TVIs in Karnataka and a nationwide survey of 105 TVIs across 15 Indian states, we surface the everyday teaching practices, technological aspirations, and systemic constraints that shape their engagement with digital technologies, including GenAI. Our findings reveal a disjuncture between the potential of GenAI and the readiness of the institutional and infrastructural ecosystem in which TVIs operate. We document pervasive challenges, including limited access to devices and connectivity, insufficient training, resistance from school management, and entrenched barriers to STEM education, while also highlighting sites of resilience, innovation, and professional commitment. This study advances the HCI discourse by centering disabled educators as key agents in the design of accessible educational futures. We argue that realizing GenAI’s inclusive potential requires moving beyond assistive technology retrofits toward co-designed, contextually grounded systems that respond to the lived realities of TVIs in the Global South.},

This paper investigates how generative AI can be integrated into documentary practice while maintaining ethical standards. Through interviews with six documentary photographers, we explored their views on AI’s potential to support community-driven storytelling. While AI presents opportunities for creative expression and community involvement, concerns about trust, authenticity, and decontextualization of images persist. Photographers expressed doubts about AI’s ability to accurately represent lived experiences, fearing it could compromise narrative integrity. Our findings suggest that AI tools should be designed to enhance collaboration and transparency in storytelling, complementing rather than replacing traditional documentary methods. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI in photography, advocating for the development of tools that preserve the ethical foundations of documentary storytelling while empowering communities.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, content generation has sparked a transformative revolution in the field of education. In traditional education, teachers often spend a lot of time preparing lessons, because students have varying levels of proficiency, teachers need to consider whether the teaching content is suitable for everyone. Generative AI provides an effective solution to this problem by automatically generating personalized, high-quality educational content, which not only alleviates the burden on teachers but also enhances students' learning outcomes. This study focuses on a novel deep generative model—a framework based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and the self-attention mechanism (Transformer). We propose a model called the Hyperspherical Variational Self-Attention Autoencoder (HVSAE), which aims to generate personalized learning content based on students' learning situations, thereby reducing the burden on teachers and improving learning outcomes. The experimental results indicate that the model can generate high-quality educational resources, providing important support for achieving more personalized and efficient education.},

It is important to investigate how special education teachers perceive and use GAI for two distinct instructional tasks: instructional enrichment and accommodations. Although the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been extensively used to study technology adoption, its application to GAI in special education is underrepresented. This gap is critical as special education teachers must address diverse needs of students with multiple disabilities. Moreover, limited research had examined how TAM dimensions vary across different tasks. This late-breaking study revealed that teachers consistently rated GAI lower for accommodations across all TAM dimensions, with particularly differences in Intention to Use and Actual Use. The results highlighted the complexities of adopting GAI for distinct instructional purposes. Although GAI demonstrated potential for supporting instructional enrichment, its inability to generate individualized recommendations limited its effectiveness for accommodations.},

But to what extent is the technology already in use? Our survey of UK public service professionals (in education, health, social work, and emergency services) seeks to answer this question. We find that use of generative AI is widespread: 45\% of respondents were aware of colleagues using generative AI, while 22\% use it themselves. Respondents were positive about its potential to enhance their efficiency and reduce their bureaucratic workload. For example, those working in the health service thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop by the equivalent of one day per week, an enormous potential impact. Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61\%) in generative AI and a low fear of replacement (16\%). However, only a minority of respondents (32\%) felt like there was clear guidance on generative AI usage in their workplaces. In other words, it is clear that generative AI is already coming into the public sector, but uptake is happening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines. The UK’s public sector urgently needs to develop more systematic methods for taking advantage of the technology.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is positively grasped as promising to disrupt the higher education system but it also poses a number of challenges. Although so many studies attempt to explore the matching of the possibility of this growing technology with the higher education system, ample research needs to be conducted to solve the challenges facing the renovation of higher education. With this in mind, our aim of bibliometric studies is to conduct a deep investigation into the increasingly developing scenario of Generative AI tools in higher education. We extracted data from the Web of Science database that is up-to-date till July 2024, comprising 934 relevant articles. Co-citation and co-word analyses revealed three main research clusters: advanced computationable methods, AI application in higher education, and user technology and adoption. The findings illustrated rapid diffusion of generative AI technologies with prominent emphasis on large-language models in pedagogical practices. Other critical themes center around developing AI-facilitated learning interventions, ethical challenges, and usage impact on learning outcomes. The results show that the field is inherently interdisciplinary, using ideas from educational technology, cognitive science, and AI. In addition, a rising trend is noted for the focus on academic honesty and users' involvement with AI devices. The results indicate the important implications of this study for teachers and policymakers alongside contributions to teaching and research that offer a guide to sustainable improvement across education. Future research would benefit from longitudinal studies drawing on an interdisciplinary approach to realize the long-term implications and address complex issues surrounding the integration of AI within universities.},

As GenAI integration in higher education grows, understanding its influence on critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity is essential. Using a mixed-effects model, we synthesized data from quantitative studies to explore two moderators: cognitive skill level (e.g., understanding, applying, analyzing) and instructional context (instructed vs. unguided use). Our findings indicate that GenAI tools significantly enhance lower-order cognitive outcomes, particularly in understanding and applying concepts, with instructed use producing stronger positive effects than unguided use. However, their impact on higher-order cognitive skills, such as creating and evaluating, was minimal. These results highlight the importance of tailoring GenAI integration to task complexity and underscore the value of guided instruction in maximizing its educational benefits. Educators should prioritize instructional strategies that encourage active engagement with GenAI tools, particularly for fostering critical thinking and creativity.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a generative artificial intelligence framework that integrates prompt engineering and K-means clustering to generate stylized dialogues from the tradition of Dream of the Red Chamber. The prompts for each character were constructed from the linguistic features of classical texts, and each generated sentence was encoded into semantic, lexical, and keyword-based features. K-means clustering was used to identify stylistic categories, and the number of clusters was validated using the Elbow Method and the Silhouette Coefficient. Evaluation used BLEU, Perplexity, and a custom Style Consistency Score. As a result, the K-means-enhanced model improved fluency and style consistency over the baseline. This method provides a quantitative approach to improving generative models in traditional cultural domains.},

  abstract = {As artificial intelligence becomes an everyday presence across education, arts and creative technologies, and cultural heritage, the interaction between users and intelligent systems deserves critical examination. This submission presents a systematic review of 95 case studies, 64 in education, 14 in arts, and 17 in heritage — selected via a PRISMA-guided search and expert screening — to map how generative artificial intelligence is embedded at both the interface and interaction levels. We identify nine interface archetypes (e.g., conversational, adaptive dashboards, immersive environments interfaces), eight interaction patterns (e.g., conversing, collaborating, manipulating),and eight main user experience dimensions as observed in case studies. Our analysis further categorizes six modality-usage patterns—from text, image, audio, and video up to fully multi-modal workflows and distillsfour main categories of end-to-end application pipelines. Notably, only two studies were found to articulate design-phase guidelines, and limitations cluster around output quality, ethical risks, and a lack of longitudinal evaluations. We conclude with limitations observed and future research focused on explainability, participatory design, and sustained field deployments. This synthesis provides a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness generative artificial intelligence as a responsive, human-centered collaborator.},

  abstract = {As the platform economy enters the deep-water zone of intelligent transformation, generative artificial intelligence (AIGC) technology is reshaping the core logic of content production and marketing strategy. In this paper, we construct the ‘AIGC-DRIVE’ dynamic closed-loop model to explain the role of AIGC in the innovation of platform economy content production and marketing strategy, and carry out efficiency comparison, AB test of AIGC advertisement strategy, and research on users' privacy concerns, as well as combining with the typical case studies of Jitterbug and SHEIN. It is found that AIGC can greatly improve the production efficiency and support the real-time optimisation of dynamic marketing strategies through data-driven multimodal content generation; however, the application of the technology faces the risks of content homogenisation, algorithmic black-boxing and user privacy leakage. This paper proposes a synergistic mechanism of ‘technology embedding - institutional constraints - user feedback’ to achieve sustainable development, which provides a theoretical basis and a practical path for the design of the governance framework of AIGC in the platform economy.},

The paper first analyzes the development of AIGC technology and its great potential in the field of education, especially the role of LLM in content generation. It then discusses the concept, risks, and construction strategies of vocational education digital textbooks, emphasizing the importance of digital textbooks in teaching and their differences compared with paper textbooks. The study also designs a knowledge retrieval question-answering system based on RAG, which combines school-based textbooks and cooperative enterprise manuals as a knowledge base to generate responses to student questions. While ensuring accuracy and completeness, the quality of the responses was improved by the merge of students' queries with relevant texts using RAG technology. Regarding implementation, RAG technology consists of knowledge base construction and knowledge retrieval. It includes segmenting the document, recognizing and vectorizing it in order to build a vector database. During user retrieval, queries are sorted through the vector database interface, and the matched knowledge fragments and query statements are merged to generate answers including specific domain knowledge. This framework of the RAG question-answering system can provide accurate answers to satisfy students of all levels in personalized teaching while maintaining explainability and timeliness of the content.},

However, traditional EC algorithms require the careful design of parameters and/or operators from experts. Designing an operator with generalization ability is a tough task, and the manually design process is often limited by the structures of existing operators, which lacks diversity. In order to explore operators with diverse structures and good generalization ability so as to provide inspiration for the manually design of operators, this paper proposes a generative EC approach for the automatic design of operators by using genetic programming (GP). We apply the generative approach to a typical EC variant named gene targeting differential evolution (GTDE), so as to propose a new automatic GTDE (AGTDE) algorithm. The AGTDE utilizes the advantage of GP in optimizing structural features to automatically generate and refine the targeting vector generation operator within GTDE. This way, the operator of AGTDE is generated automatically rather than manually designed, which is more robust and optimal. The experimental results demonstrate that AGTDE is capable of identifying appropriate and even better operator for solving optimization problems, when compared with GTDE with manually design operator. Moreover, the results show that the operator obtained for one problem can be applied to other problems and obtain promising results, which reflect the robustness and generalization ability of the operator generated by GP. Therefore, this generative approach may provide some novel avenues of thought for the automatically design of EC algorithm operators.},

However, its full potential is not fully exploited due to the limited availability of publicly accessible datasets crucial for advancing research in EDA. This paper highlights the dual role of generative AI; in particular, it showcases (i) BeGAN, the use of a generative AI strategy to create thousands of realistic benchmarks for power grid synthesis and analysis to advance power-related research, and (ii) EDA Corpus---an expert-curated and generative AI-enhanced dataset to serve research and development of EDA tool assistants. These two case studies emphasize the ability of generative methods to create and utilize datasets to advance research and lower the barriers to entry in EDA.},

  abstract = {Generative recommender systems have gained increasing attention as an innovative approach that directly generates item identifiers for recommendation tasks. Despite their potential, a major challenge is the effective construction of item identifiers that align well with recommender systems. Current approaches often treat item tokenization and generative recommendation training as separate processes, which can lead to suboptimal performance. To overcome this issue, we introduce ETEGRec, a novel End-To-End Generative Recommender that unifies item tokenization and generative recommendation into a cohesive framework. Built on a dual encoder-decoder architecture, ETEGRec consists of an item tokenizer and a generative recommender. To enable synergistic interaction between these components, we propose a recommendation-oriented alignment strategy, which includes two key optimization objectives: sequence-item alignment and preference-semantic alignment. These objectives tightly couple the learning processes of the item tokenizer and the generative recommender, fostering mutual enhancement. Additionally, we develop an alternating optimization technique to ensure stable and efficient end-to-end training of the entire framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to traditional sequential recommendation models and existing generative recommendation baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/ETEGRec.},

This includes: insights on the creation process, a set of prototype explorations, and an integrated workflow for multi-modal video generation. Generative video is rapidly evolving and delivering higher quality outputs. While video generation models have potential for film-making and content creation, they lack controllability for creative expression: viable videos can require hundreds of unsuccessful attempts. To understand this emergent practice, and due to the constant evolution of models and limited number of early adopters, I explored Generative Rotoscoping over 12 months and created AI workflows leading to over 40,000 video/image files examining a variety of models and techniques including: structural guidance, frame consistency, image referencing and masks, compositing, among others. Insights from this work can serve as a starting point for designing the next generation of video authoring tools.},

  abstract = {Reading skills are crucial for students' success in education and beyond. However, reading proficiency among K-12 students has been declining globally, including in Sweden, leaving many underprepared for post-secondary education. Additionally, an increasing number of students have reading disorders, such as dyslexia, which require support. Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) technologies, like ChatGPT, may offer new opportunities to improve reading practices by enhancing the readability of educational texts. This study investigates whether ChatGPT-4 can simplify academic texts and which prompting strategies are most effective. We tasked ChatGPT to re-write 136 academic texts using four prompting approaches: Standard, Meta, Roleplay, and Chain-of-Thought. All four approaches improved text readability, with Meta performing the best overall and the Standard prompt sometimes creating texts that were less readable than the original. This study found variability in the simplified texts, suggesting that different strategies should be used based on the specific needs of individual learners. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of genAI tools, like ChatGPT, to improve the accessibility of academic texts, offering valuable support for students with reading difficulties and promoting more equitable learning opportunities.},

The experimental results demonstrate that the LLM's shortcomings in command relation understanding can be supplemented by external models to generate promising templates. We do not rule out the contribution of validators to property-specific consistency. However, our framework aims to preserve the large language model generation capability while focusing on the implicit relationships in configurations. By introducing a hierarchical command graph, we follow a top-down matching to generate templates, reducing feedback interactions in generation and bring potential solutions for automated provisioning. We process template generation under different scenarios, including establishing BGP basic connections on multiple routers and imposing restrictions such as route redistribution at specific locations. Human involvement is restricted to providing critical information. Experiment shows that expected templates can be generated in the first iteration, particularly for the basic task. The advanced task is influenced by multiple factors, however, it still shows considerable potential in terms of coverage with possibly feasible templates.},

In this paper, we propose a semantic segmentation method based on a dynamic multimodal noise addition technique combined with the SegFormer model to improve the robustness of street view image segmentation in complex environments. The study takes five major roads (West Beijing Road, North Taiping Road, Changjiang Road, Yihe Road, and Central Road) in Nanjing as objects, and based on the streetscape and remote sensing data of the vegetation growth season from 2017 to 2022, the Gaussian noise, motion blur, and weather effects are simulated by the multimodal noise addition technique, which effectively improves the adaptability of the model to the dynamic interference. The experiments showed that the Green View Index analysis revealed a general upward trend of street greening (average increase of 0.94\%). Furthermore, the Kendall rank correlation analysis reveals the positive correlation between environmental factors and green visualization rate, and the influence law of environmental factors on green perception is verified. This study provides a high-precision computer vision analysis framework for urban greening planning and promotes the application of semantic segmentation models in complex urban scenes.},

  abstract = {The progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fueled AI-powered tools like co-pilots and assistants to provision better guidance, particularly during data analysis. However, research on guidance has not yet examined the perceived efficacy of the source from which guidance is offered and the impact of this source on the user’s perception and usage of guidance. We ask whether users perceive all guidance sources as equal, with particular interest in three sources: (i) “AI,” (ii) “human expert,” and (iii) “a group of human analysts.” As a benchmark, we consider a fourth source, (iv) “unattributed guidance,” where guidance is provided without attribution to any source, enabling isolation of and comparison with the effects of source-specific guidance. We design a five-condition between-subjects study, with one condition for each of the four guidance sources and an additional (v) “no-guidance” condition, which serves as a baseline to evaluate the influence of any kind of guidance. We situate our study in a custom data preparation and analysis tool wherein we task users to select relevant attributes from an unfamiliar dataset to inform a business report. Depending on the assigned condition, users can request guidance, which the system then provides in the form of attribute suggestions. To ensure internal validity, we control for the quality of guidance across source-conditions. Through several metrics of usage and perception, we statistically test five preregistered hypotheses and report on additional analysis. We find that the source of guidance matters to users, but not in a manner that matches received wisdom. For instance, users utilize guidance differently at various stages of analysis, including expressing varying levels of regret, despite receiving guidance of similar quality. Notably, users in the AI condition reported both higher post-task benefit and regret. These findings strongly indicate the need to further understand how different guidance sources impact user behavior for designing effective guidance systems.},

A key innovation is the intent-based outcome specification, where users define desired results through natural language, sketches, or gestures, thus shifting control from users to AI models. This paradigm enables new forms of co-creation while presenting challenges in creating effective and safe outcome specifications.This workshop aims to investigate the design, implementation, and evaluation of intent-based co-creative experiences that boost human creativity in work, play, and education across text, images, audio, code, and video. Key questions focus on how creativity support can guide generative AI development and how to leverage generative models for positive user experiences.

It uses a set of real-world 2D images and corresponding camera poses as input, generating 3D auxiliary samples that are fed into a Transformer-based 3D diffusion model for training in 3D shape generation. By training the rendering function to generate color and density, we can restore the color details of object surfaces. This enables HoloDiT to generate realistic 3D shapes from 2D images. We trained on the real-world CO3Dv2 dataset, and the generated results demonstrate competitive quality and consistency compared to existing 3D generation models.},

  abstract = {Background: This study will comprehensively analyze the current research status and application of artificial intelligence in traditional Chinese medicine using systematic bibliometric methods. This study also explores the emerging research hotspots and future development trends in this field, providing valuable references for related scholars. Methods: We systematically retrieved relevant publications on the research and application of artificial intelligence in traditional Chinese medicine from 2003 to 2022 using the Web of Science. Graph making, statistical analysis, and visualization studies were performed using Microsoft Office Excel (version 2021), CiteSpace (version 6.2.R4), and VOSviewer (version 1.6.19.0) software. Results: As of October 30, 2023, we have identified 722 publications with a citation frequency 9135. Notably, China exhibits remarkable dominance in terms of publication counts (86.15\%), citation counts (6931), and h-index (41). Furthermore, Chen, Calvin Yu-Chian of Sun Yat-sen University has contributed significantly with the highest number of publications at 13. Additionally, deep learning methods have emerged as the predominant algorithms for artificial intelligence in recent years, and the diagnosis of image segmentation, primarily feature extraction-based tongue diagnosis, has garnered substantial research attention. Conclusion: The bibliometric analysis revealed that using deep learning approaches for diagnosis and prediction represents a burgeoning area of research interest. Moreover, the prospective clinical application of artificial intelligence in traditional Chinese medicine is poised to become a prominent subject shortly.},

  abstract = {Amid the convergence of traditional education and the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the education sector faces a significant challenge. To comprehensively assess how AI has influenced students' learning, we apply a targeted questionnaire, gathering information about students' basic information, situation about internet usage, learning needs, and attitudes towards AI tools. Based on 4,606 valid responses, we construct a hierarchical evaluation model, and make correlation analysis accordingly. The result has shown that the influence of AI is general, particularly for students who are in lower-grade or majored in science and engineering fields, and the problem of lack of experience and professionalism is common. Objective conditions and motivation have played a crucial role. To make sensible use of AI in study, the educators may consider giving tips of transparent policy, offering personalized instructions, bettering the access of intelligent tools, and motivating students' self-directed learning.},

  abstract = {We conduct an incentivized laboratory experiment to study people's perception of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) alignment in the context of economic decision-making. Using a panel of economic problems spanning the domains of risk, time preference, social preference, and strategic interactions, we ask human subjects to make choices for themselves and to predict the choices made by GenAI on behalf of a human user. These problems confront agents with trade-offs (e.g., higher payoff vs. earlier payoff, efficiency vs. equity, riskier but potentially higher rewards vs. safer but lower rewards) and the optimal choices depend on the agent's preferences. We find that people overestimate the degree to which GenAI choices are aligned with human preferences in general (anthropomorphic projection), and with their personal references in particular (self projection). On average, human subjects' predictions about GenAI's choices in every decision environment are much closer to the average human-subject choice than to the average GenAI choice. At the individual level, human subjects' predictions about GenAI's choices in a given environment are highly correlated with their own choices in the same environment.We explore the implications of anthropomorphic projection and self projection in a stylized theoretical model. Our theoretical analysis shows that anthropomorphic projection and self projection can lead to over-delegation to GenAI. More subtly, we also find that objectively improving AI alignment can harm agents who exhibit anthropomorphic projection (because they mistakenly adjust their delegation decisions in a detrimental fashion). Similarly, among agents who exhibit self projection, welfare may be higher for those who have more unusual preferences (since they are less likely to mistakenly delegate).The full paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14708},

Using a combination of gait feature extraction and deep learning models, human silhouettes are separated from complex backgrounds for modeling, and their gait features are extracted for identification.3D ResNet-18 residual network learns spatio-temporal features to extract temporal and spatial features in the sequence of video frames and introduces a cross-entropy loss function to optimize the model and improve the prediction accuracy. When dealing with the challenges of motion blurring in the video captured by drones and shadows and noise interference in background modeling, the improved MOG2 background separation algorithm detects pedestrian gait and models it, and adaptive variance thresholding improves the background detection capability and improves the spatio-temporal feature extraction and optimization, which significantly improves the robustness of the model. The experiments use the Walking category in the KTH public dataset, and the results show that the model exhibits good recognition results in different backgrounds. This approach effectively improves the performance of UAVs in applications such as security surveillance.},

  abstract = {Conceptual design is an important stage in industrial product development, influenced by the design space and materials available to designers. Advancements in human-computer interaction&nbsp;(HCI) and artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI) technologies have broadened these aspects considerably. On the one hand, augmented reality&nbsp;(AR) technologies merge physical and virtual representations to enhance intuitive interaction and embodied cognition. On the other hand, generative artificial intelligence&nbsp;(GAI) serves as a novel design material, boosting creativity and productivity. Inspired by these technological strides, we proposed an Intelli-Embodied Design Space&nbsp;(IEDS), which integrates designers, AR, and GAI to support industrial conceptual design by combining embodied interaction with generative variability. Within IEDS, designers can interact with the physical prototypes intuitively, while GAI refines these into virtual forms that can be embedded in the physical world through AR technology. In this study, we established the theoretical framework and interaction modes of IEDS through literature reviews and expert interviews. Subsequently, we designed and implemented three GAI+AR tools, GAI + Head-mounted Display&nbsp;(HMD), GAI + Handheld Display&nbsp;(HHD), and GAI + Spatial Augmented Reality&nbsp;(SAR), based on three AR approaches in IEDS to practically examine the benefits and challenges of these interaction modes across industrial conceptual design tasks. We discussed IEDS’s influence on industrial conceptual design and released its application guidelines to the HCI community.},

In a pilot study with 37 fifth-graders, we explored how children (ages 9–10) envision genAI and the roles they believe it should play in their daily life. Our findings reveal three key ways children envision genAI: as a companion providing guidance, a collaborator working alongside them, and a task automator that offloads responsibilities. However, alongside these hopeful views, children expressed fears about overreliance, particularly in academic settings, linking it to fears of diminished learning, disciplinary consequences, and long-term failure. This study highlights the need for child-centric AI design that balances these tensions, empowering children with the skills to critically engage with and navigate their evolving relationships with digital technologies.},

However, using IGAI has challenges, such as encoded biases, which might reinforce stereotypes and harm underrepresented communities. We conducted a case study to explore how using IGAI alters the co-design process of public parks through public engagement. We use data collected from interviews with immigrants discussing the Puente Hills Landfill Park design in Los Angeles, which will re-purpose a former landfill into a new public park. We use Dream Studio as a Design Probe, generating images from the interviewees’ insights and critically reflecting on the design process through internal interviews and a reflective workshop. We analyze our case in three domains: Opportunities, Risks and Challenges, and Features and Requirements. In the opportunities domain, we discuss how the enhanced translation of words to images changes the relationship between stakeholder engagement, multiplicity, and efficiency. In the risks and challenges domain, we discuss how IGAI might enhance power imbalances and biases. Finally, we reflect on what features would ease the safe and responsible use of IGAI to engage citizens in co-designing public parks.},

  abstract = {Graph classification has significant applications in various domains, including chemical molecular structure prediction, social network analysis, recommendation systems, and biological network analysis, and has received considerable attention in recent years. However, real-world graph datasets often exhibit class imbalance, where the disproportionate distribution of classes can cause models to favor the majority class, reducing prediction accuracy for minority classes. Notably, minority or anomalous classes often hold unique value in many practical scenarios. This paper proposes a framework for graph classification under category imbalance named Generator Imbalanced Graph Classification(GIGC). GIGC employs a set of learnable augmented graph generators orchestrated by an automated augmentation strategy to enhance minority-class graphs. This approach increases the diversity of minority-class samples, balances the dataset's class distribution, and improves the model's generalization capabilities. Simultaneously, k-reciprocal nearest neighbors are utilized to capture inter-graph relationships more effectively, leveraging the properties of symmetry and reciprocity. Subsequently, Graph-of-Graph Neural Networks are used to model inter-graph relationships, capturing global associations between graphs at a higher level. This enables the model to better capture and utilize inter-graph information. By leveraging the latent connections between minority-class graphs and other graphs, GIGC enriches the representation of minority-class graphs, mitigating the negative effects of class imbalance on classification performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that GIGC outperforms baseline methods in graph classification. Specifically, F1-macro and F1-micro are improved by at least 1.12\% and 2.62\%, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of GIGC in addressing class imbalance in graph classification tasks.},

  abstract = {With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a powerful tool in the field of graphic design. However, balancing the trade-off between style diversity and sample quality remains a significant challenge. This study proposes a novel framework for generating and evaluating graphic design style diversity using conditional GANs (cGANs). By incorporating regularization strategies and style embedding mechanisms, the framework allows precise control over both the style and the diversity of generated samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively generates high-quality samples in both Retro and Minimalist styles. The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) scores of 22.5 for Retro and 28.7 for Minimalist, significantly lower than the baseline model's FID score of 34.2, indicate that the generated samples are visually closer to real data. Additionally, the Perceptual Path Length (PPL) score of 120.4 (compared to 178.7 for the baseline model) reflects smoother and more diverse distributions in the latent space. t-SNE visualizations further validate the broad coverage and clear separation of generated samples across different styles. This work provides a new paradigm for applying AI in the creative industry, with significant implications for the automation and diversification of graphic design.},

  abstract = {In response to the requirements for efficiency and accuracy in segmentation models in autonomous driving scenarios, an improved urban road semantic segmentation algorithm based on the Deep Dual-Resolution Network (DDRNet) has been proposed. Firstly, a Channel Residual Attention Module (CRAM) based on standard attention mechanisms is introduced at the end of two parallel branches of the DDRNet to focus on important channel features. Secondly, the backbone network incorporates Depthwise Over-parameterized Convolution (DO-Conv) to boost feature extraction performance. Finally, a Deep Aggregation Pyramid Pooling Module (DAPPM) with Hybrid Dilated Convolution (HDC) is designed to capture multi-scale feature information, and Group Normalization (GN) is utilized to mitigate the impact of reduced batch size. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) of 77.0\% on the Cityscapes dataset, representing an improvement of 1.1\% over the baseline model. Additionally, the segmentation speed reaches 106 Frames Per Second (FPS), achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency.},

Regrettably, the Apriori algorithm is not only the most classical algorithm, but also has some weaknesses, for instance, it has high computational complexity, generates too many candidate itemsets, which in turn leads it to be mainly used in small-scale educational data scenarios only. In this paper, the authors propose a modified version of the Apriori algorithm which aims to the rule generation process and the computational operation more efficient through data preprocessing phase information improvement and using the dynamic thresholding adjusting component as well as a not-so-well-known intelligent technique. The usefulness of the improved algorithm is tested by an experiment with actual course performance assessments, and the algorithm is also applied in the educational decision support system which comprises the course recommendation, teaching strategy optimization, and academic risk prediction the students. The results of the study suggest that there are no gains in script execution speed, generalization rate, or memory usage while there are with great advantage in the run time of the proposed algorithm. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is superior to the traditional one as it provides higher efficiency and thus, could be the best choice for educational data mining.},

We use speculative and critical design as our approach to avoid abstract guesswork and provide more nuanced and concrete insights into the matter at hand. We conducted five speculative design workshops centered on Infinity Book, a fictional system capable of generating any kind of literary work. Participants used brainwriting, the Future Ripples method, and dialogue-labs to explore potential futures and socio-material impacts of such technology. Reflexive Thematic Analysis was employed to analyze the results from the workshops, and we developed twelve design fictions that illustrate diverse uses and societal implications of GenAI. Based on these results, we formulated three strong concepts, Authenticity, Creative Agency, and Liveness, that link concrete design considerations with broader philosophical discussions.},

We present a new perspective on IR research in which the users of an IR system are intelligent agents instead of human users. Extending the current work on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we identify five novel IR tasks that an intelligent agent must be able to perform in order to achieve Human-Level Artificial Intelligence, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), including 1) External Information Retrieval (EIR) to access new information unseen by the agent, 2) Provenance Information Retrieval (PIR) to trace the provenance of information, 3) Curriculum Information Retrieval (CIR) to actively acquire the most useful new data and information for lifelong learning, 4) Rule Information Retrieval (RIR) to perform reasoning and problem solving, and 5) Scenario Information Retrieval (SIR) to leverage past scenarios for problem solving and decision making. We compare these new IR tasks with the traditional IR tasks performed by an IR system that serves human users and systematically examine the challenges involved in the five new IR tasks, providing a roadmap for new IR research within the broader context of AGI development.},

  abstract = {The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI is fundamentally transforming information retrieval and processing on the Internet, bringing both great potential and significant concerns regarding content authenticity and reliability. This paper presents a novel quantitative approach to shed light on the complex information dynamics arising from the growing use of generative AI tools. Despite their significant impact on the digital ecosystem, these dynamics remain largely uncharted and poorly understood. We propose a stochastic model to characterize the generation, indexing, and dissemination of information in response to new topics. This scenario particularly challenges current LLMs, which often rely on real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to overcome their static knowledge limitations. Our findings suggest that the rapid pace of generative AI adoption, combined with increasing user reliance, can outpace human verification, escalating the risk of inaccurate information proliferation across digital resources. An in-depth analysis of Stack Exchange data confirms that high-quality answers inevitably require substantial time and human effort to emerge. This underscores the considerable risks associated with generating persuasive text in response to new questions and highlights the critical need for responsible development and deployment of future generative AI tools.},

To address these issues, this study proposes a teaching model driven by intelligent-digital integration, aiming to unify theory and practice effectively. The integration of AR/VR interactive learning systems, modular digital training systems, and intelligent classroom analytics systems constructs a closed-loop teaching framework. This framework follows the sequence of theory, practice, and evaluation. A case study on the course Microcontroller Application Technology verifies the effectiveness of this implementation. Findings indicate that the proposed model significantly improves learning outcomes. It also raises the frequency of classroom interaction and enhances the efficiency of completing practical tasks. The model gathers data in real time and evaluates it from multiple dimensions. This optimizes the teaching process across its entire cycle. It provides technical methods and practical models. These can be replicated for the digital transformation of vocational education.},

Traditional manual programming has become increasingly inadequate to meet the demands for flexibility and real-time performance in intelligent manufacturing. This paper reviews the integration of intelligent manufacturing and PLC technologies, highlighting the core role of Human-Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPS) and demonstrating how it effectively guides theoretical research and engineering practices in new-generation intelligent manufacturing. We innovatively classify automatic PLC code generation methods through multiple dimensions and propose a new framework for Structured Text (ST) code generation.

  abstract = {There are a large number of violations of safety regulations at the construction site of the power grid. These behaviors do not comply with safety supervision norms and can cause significant safety hazards. In response to the problem of difficulty in capturing and alerting such violations, we have designed an intelligent recognition system for violations based on enhanced YOLOv5 and generative visual big models to automatically detect violations and potential safety hazards at the construction site of the power grid. We have constructed a private dataset of violations at the construction site of the power grid. In our improved YOLOv5 model, we first added a spatial channel attention mechanism to the Neck section of Yolov5 to enhance its ability to extract spatial features and distinguish between different channel features, enabling the network to better distinguish different targets. In addition, we have added a spatial attention mechanism after the SPP of the backbone network, which enables the network to fully utilize spatial information, extract more prominent features, and improve the accuracy and recall of the model. In addition, to compensate for the lack of negative samples in the dataset, we use a generative visual model to generate a large number of negative sample images to enhance the dataset and address the issue of insufficient negative samples. We have designed a real-time safety supervision intelligent system for detecting violations on construction sites based on the above model and method, using IoT devices such as on-site real-time cameras, intermediate data servers, and routers. We conducted extensive experiments on real construction site datasets, and the results showed that our method has significantly improved compared to the original model. The MAP of the system is 94.0\%, indicating that the model has strong detection ability and robustness in identifying personnel and safety tools in power grid construction site scenarios.},

Current evaluations primarily depend on subjective questionnaire data or code quality metrics. A supplemental objective, continuous, real-time developer-centered measure is missing. Wearables with body sensors that measure the physiological activity of a person have the aforementioned benefits. With their help, impeding factors from GenAI tools on a developer's well-being and cognitive load may be detected. Implications for productivity may be deduced from these cognitive load measures. This research aims to use body sensor data to (1) assess the ability of wearables to measure developers' cognitive load in their everyday working context to then (2) evaluate developer experience, productivity and GenAI interactions in real-life work environments. A holistic mixed-method approach by combining subjective and objective measures in a developer-centered manner is taken.},

This paper critically examines the multifaceted adoption of GenAI in HE by reviewing interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks from psychology, computer science, and pedagogy. It highlights the insufficiency of traditional technology acceptance models, which predominantly address cognitive and rational decision-making processes, and advocates for the inclusion of emotional and ethical dimensions often overlooked in existing frameworks. By synthesizing research across various disciplines, this review identifies significant gaps and proposes an integrated theoretical model to effectively understand and guide GenAI adoption. The proposed framework emphasizes the need for robust, empirically supported methodologies that accommodate the complex, dynamic nature of GenAI applications. This paper not only contributes to academic discourse by providing a comprehensive review of existing literature but also sets a foundation for future empirical studies aimed at refining GenAI integration strategies in HE, ensuring they are ethically aligned and educationally effective.},

  abstract = {The remarkable advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has driven revolutionary applications for text-to-image generation, like Stable Diffusion and Imagen. Especially, the diffusion model can generate stunning images from natural language descriptions by using a reverse continuous denoising process. However, the computation burden of diffusion model-based GenAI services poses a significant hurdle for their practical implementation. In this work, we propose a novel edge computing-assisted GenAI framework to enable efficient GenAI service provision, where the intermediate output generated by diffusion models can be cached on edge servers and reused by various users to improve edge computing resource utilization. Assuming the existence of causally correlated auxiliary information, a long-term caching problem is formulated under intra-time-slot caching constraints by considering various maximally reusable steps of diffusion model-based GenAI tasks and the available caching capacity at edge servers. By leveraging the Lyapunov optimization framework, we transform the time-average caching problem into several deterministic problems for different time slots. We develop a deep reinforcement learning-based caching (DRC) algorithm to obtain caching decisions in each time slot, where a deep neural network (DNN)-based caching action generation module and a model-based evaluation module are designed. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation experiments by comparing the DRC algorithm with benchmark algorithms. The simulation results depict that the proposed DRC algorithm can reduce response time and improve cache hit rates significantly. The code is available at https://gitee.com/pipihinsky/DRC.},

To allow for the development and testing of new algorithms adapted to this new data landscape, test problems are necessary as a way to both evaluate and compare algorithms performances. However, while recent advances extended known test problems such as the r-Leading-Ones marking the transition from binary to multi-valued variables, having different data-types coexisting in the search space is still an open question. We propose the h-Leading-Ones as an extension of the r-Leading-Ones to evaluate the ability of an algorithm to solve problems on a search space composed of multi-valued and real-valued data types. Its design with dependency between the different data-types and its continuity with the r-Leading-Ones provides a convenient new environment for benchmark and runtime analysis for mixed-category search spaces.},

  abstract = {The widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) technologies has increased the need to support youth in developing AI/ML literacies. However, most work has centered on preparing young people to use these systems, with less attention to how they can participate in designing and evaluating them. This study investigates how engaging young people in the design and auditing of generative language models (GLMs) may foster the development of their understanding of how these systems work from both technical and ethical perspectives. The study takes an in-pieces approach to investigate novices’ conceptions of GLMs. Such an approach supports the analysis of how technical and ethical conceptions evolve and relate to each other. I am currently conducting a series of participatory design workshops with sixteen ninth graders (ages 14–15) in which they will (a) build GLMs from a data-driven perspective that glassboxes how data shapes model performance and (b) audit commercial GLMs by repeatedly and systematically querying them to draw inferences about their behaviors. I will analyze participants’ interactions to identify ethical and technical conceptions they may exhibit while designing and auditing GLMs. Then I will investigate the contexts in which these conceptions emerge and how participants’ personal interests and prior experiences may relate to their conceptions. I will also conduct clinical interviews and use microgenetic knowledge analysis and ordered network analysis to investigate how participants’ ethical and technical conceptions of GLMs relate to each other and change after the workshop. The study will contribute (a) evidence of how engaging youth in design and auditing activities may support the development of ethical and technical understanding of GLMs and (b) an inventory of novice design and auditing practices that may support youth’s technical and ethical understanding of GLMs.},

Since a USAR canine often works out of sight of the handler, the handler lacks awareness of the canine’s location and situation, known as the “sensemaking gap.” In this paper, we propose KHAIT, a novel approach to close the sensemaking gap and enhance USAR effectiveness by integrating object detection-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR). Equipped with AI-powered cameras, edge computing, and AR headsets, KHAIT enables precise and rapid object detection from a canine’s perspective, improving survivor localization. We evaluate this approach in a real-world USAR environment, demonstrating an average survival allocation time decrease of 22\%, enhancing the speed and accuracy of operations.},

  abstract = {The management of organizational and worker knowledge is a critical part of any organization. Knowledge management recognizes the explicit knowledge that workers contribute to an organization, as well as the organizational knowledge and skills acquired over time. The potential impact of generative AI (GenAI) raises many issues and opportunities related to effective knowledge management as organizations explore the impact and implications of its adoption. This research explores issues related to an increasing world of GenAI and proposes a Framework for Knowledge Management in the GenAI Era. Knowledge management workers, who are novices, might be more inclined to use generative AI for performing their tasks. Expert knowledge workers might focus on quality evaluation and quality assessment. Adoption of GenAI may help with the progression from novice to expert, while freeing up time and resources for other work. Challenges include the potential loss of critical organizational knowledge, definition of job-related requirements, expectations, and tasks, as well as over-reliance and loss of tacit or unarticulated knowledge. These challenges must be balanced against available access to large amounts of general and domain-specific knowledge from GenAI to capture the value realized from its adoption.},

  abstract = {Shipboard emergencies can easily induce secondary events because of any time and space transition. Carrier-based aircraft emergencies have complexity, tight coupling and strong real-time characteristics. Therefore, it is of great significance to reasonably predict the development trend of the incident in the emergency treatment to reduce the harm. Due to the sudden and random nature of naval battlefield accidents, some incidents are not covered by the historical case base. Traditional retrieval approaches to event prediction using case knowledge are limited by the sparsity of events and the cold-start problem. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-graph neural network for event development trend prediction, which disassembles events into event features and introduces the shipboard aircraft domain knowledge graph. We produce a data set around the event features of carrier-based aircraft on the simulation platform. The results show that the graph neural network with knowledge graph is superior in modeling the higher-order semantic association between event features. Compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods, our approach exhibits significant improvements.},

To address this technical problem, from the perspective of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content, modeling methods such as support vector machines, random search, and machine learning for key performance indicators (KPI) in business decision-making systems have been proposed. The system integrates with large language models, driving the generative efficiency and accuracy of KPI data cleaning, feature extraction, and model optimization training. Using MATLAB to conduct predictive simulation experiments on the integrated system, compared to general information systems for KPIs that do not utilize large language models or Artificial Intelligence Generated Content, the volume of reference data for business decision-making based on large language models increased by 93.61 times, and decision-making efficiency improved by 36.59\%, indicating that the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content modeling scheme for business decision-making systems based on operational KPIs is feasible.},

The conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. Over the years, the conference has evolved and is now one of the most relevant venues for discussion of the highest quality research on how learning and teaching can be transformed by technology.The aim of L@S is to address real-world educational challenges and simultaneously contribute to a fundamental understanding of human learning. Together, our goal is to investigate how data and technology can be leveraged to create more responsible and effective learning experiences for all learners across the globe. The theme of L@S 2025 is Learning Synergies @ Scale. As technology continues to reshape education, at the L@S 2025 conference we explore how generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its new possibilities can be leveraged to better support learning across the lifespan. L@S 2025 explores the impact of AI on learning with an emphasis on scalability and the broader impact of technological advances in learning environments. As a community we address the challenges of applying scalable, technology-driven solutions in both structured institutional environments and dynamic, self-directed learning communities, especially those that provide actionable insights for equitable and effective adaptive learning experiences. Creating synergies between research and practice, and contributing to breaking down barriers between the two, we present research co-informed by practice at scale.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have revolutionized information retrieval and content generation, opening up new opportunities for the e-commerce industry. Alignment learning between small models and parallel corpora cannot meet current needs. The success of ChatGPT demonstrates that large models need to first establish a fundamental understanding, and then utilize high-quality corpora for generation. Having a large model foundation is indispensable. In this paper, we establish a fundamental 10B multimodal model foundation for multimodal generation tasks and propose a scene-based alignment learning approach called conditional sample supervised fine-tuning for downstream generation tasks. Meanwhile, diffusion models are known to be vulnerable to outliers in training data. To address this, we utilize an alternative diffusion loss function that preserves the high quality of generated data like the original squared L2 loss while being robust to outliers.In practical test sets, the multimodal foundation fully demonstrates its alignment and comprehension abilities for graphic and textual content. Additionally, conditional fine-tuning and the design of the loss function significantly enhance the quality of generated content. The quality rate of images has increased by 34.3 percentage points, and prompt control has improved by 19.8 percentage points. The application of our framework in Baidu Search Ads has led to significant revenue growth. For instance, ads with generated image creatives have achieved a 29\% higher click-through rate (CTR), resulting in a daily consumption of 3 million yuan.},

With AI/ML technologies being increasingly integrated into young people's lives, there is an urgent need to equip teenagers with AI literacies that build both technical knowledge and awareness of social impacts. Algorithm audits (also called AI audits) have traditionally been employed by experts to assess potential harmful biases, but recent research suggests that non-expert users can also participate productively in auditing. We conducted a two-week participatory design workshop with 14 teenagers (ages 14-15), where they audited the generative AI model behind TikTok's Effect House, a tool for creating interactive TikTok filters. We present a case study describing how teenagers approached the audit, from deciding what to audit to analyzing data using diverse strategies and communicating their results. Our findings show that participants were engaged and creative throughout the activities, independently raising and exploring new considerations, such as age-related biases, that are uncommon in professional audits. We drew on our expertise in algorithm auditing to triangulate their findings as a way to examine if the workshop supported participants to reach coherent conclusions in their audit. Although the resulting number of changes in race, gender, and age representation uncovered by the teens were slightly different from ours, we reached similar conclusions. This study highlights the potential for auditing to inspire learning activities to foster AI literacies, empower teenagers to critically examine AI systems, and contribute fresh perspectives to the study of algorithmic harms.},

  abstract = {Generative AI has emerged as a transformative technology capable of reshaping public sector operations by streamlining administrative tasks, enhancing data analytics, and driving more personalized citizen interactions. Despite its potential, a critical gap remains in understanding how generative AI can be effectively integrated into government processes, particularly in developing countries like Indonesia, where bureaucratic inefficiencies and infrastructural constraints persist. This study addresses this gap by conducting a mixed-method investigation that combines a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of generative AI applications across multiple sectors to inform public service innovation, with expert interviews from key stakeholders Indonesian government, academic, and industry. The findings indicate that generative AI holds substantial promise for reducing manual processes, improving inter-agency coordination, and fostering data-driven decision-making. However, challenges related to ethical considerations, data privacy, and limited digital infrastructure present significant barriers to widespread adoption. By proposing a governance framework and offering strategic recommendations tailored to the Indonesian context, this research provides actionable insights for policymakers, government agencies, and technology providers. In doing so, it contributes to the evolving discourse on AI-driven public service innovation and offers a pathway toward realizing a more efficient and citizen-focused smart government in Indonesia.},

However, because the output of GenAI cannot be guaranteed to be correct, manual intervention remains necessary. Some of this intervention can be automated through task-specific tools, alongside additional methodologies for correctness verification and effective prompt development. We explored the application of GenAI in assisting with code translation, language interoperability, and codebase inspection within a legacy Fortran codebase used to simulate particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the process, we developed a tool, CodeScribe, which combines prompt engineering with user supervision to establish an efficient process for code conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate how CodeScribe assists in converting Fortran code to C++, generating Fortran-C APIs for integrating legacy systems with modern C++ libraries, and providing developer support for code organization and algorithm implementation. We also address the challenges of AI-driven code translation and highlight its benefits for enhancing productivity in scientific computing workflows.},

Poetry is no exception, as even general-purpose language models now routinely generate convincing emulations of poetic form. While researchers have closely examined such machine-generated poetry, few have studied human-AI collaboration in poetry writing from a posthuman perspective. Through semi-structured interviews with ten participants in an AI English poetry contest and an analysis of their dialogs with AIs, we summarize the affordances and challenges of such collaborative practice using posthumanism as a lens. We then expose interesting tensions, for example, between human self-expression and the diminished (or relocated) agency that AI collaboration often entails. This collaborative, yet often adversarial, process provides insights into the nature of the posthuman condition as regards creative collaboration between human and machine.},

  abstract = {Graphs, which encode pairwise relations between entities, serve as a fundamental data structure across real-world domains. Many critical applications can be formulated as graph-based tasks, and graph machine learning (GML), from the shallow embedding models to graph neural networks and further advanced to the most powerful graph transformers, has been well-established to automate knowledge discovery and decision-making on graphs. In parallel, the recent emergence of large foundational models has driven machine learning into a new era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), and this revolution presents both unprecedented opportunities and profound challenges for the well-established GML paradigms. However, few investigations have analyzed and envisioned how GML should evolve to harness these opportunities, address these challenges, and embrace this new Gen-AI era. To fill in this gap, we organize the first international Workshop on Machine Learning on Graphs in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (MLoG-GenAI), held in connection with the 31st ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, which provides a venue to gather academic researchers and industry practitioners to discuss and picture the development of GML in the new Gen-AI era.},

  abstract = {It is crucial to align course design with measurable learning outcomes in light of the increasing emphasis on Outcome-Based Education (OBE) in contemporary pedagogical reforms. This study combines knowledge graph systems with OBE rules to establish a comprehensive framework for financial management knowledge. Key concepts and logical relationships were extracted from authoritative textbooks using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. A knowledge graph was constructed by Neo4j, which plainly reflects the hierarchical structure and relationships among these information items. Further, the study statistically assessed the impact of semantic similarity computations and network analysis techniques like PageRank on mapping information points to particular OBE objectives. Improved alignment between knowledge points and OBE objectives is demonstrated by experimental results that show a 6\% increase in semantic similarity and a 30\% decrease in mapping variance. In addition, utilizing the knowledge graph for teaching optimization resulted in a 7\% decrease in overall course satisfaction and a 15\% decrease in the core knowledge acquisition time. These results highlight the potential for using AI-driven systems and data analysis to improve lesson design in online education settings.},

Yet, users’ understanding of how such ecosystems work remains unknown. In this paper, we investigate users’ mental models of how GenAI Chatbot Ecosystems work. This is an important question because users’ mental models guide their behaviors, including making decisions that impact their privacy. Through 21 semi-structured interviews, we uncovered users’ four mental models towards first-party (e.g., Google Gemini) and third-party (e.g., ChatGPT) GenAI Chatbot Ecosystems. These mental models centered around the role of the chatbot in the entire ecosystem. We further found that participants held a more consistent and simpler mental model towards third-party ecosystems than the first-party ones, resulting in higher trust and fewer concerns towards the third-party ecosystems. We discuss the design and policy implications based on our results.},

Traditional contact-based measurement methods face significant limitations in high temperature and extreme environments, such as safety risks, inaccurate measurements due to interference with the environment, and short equipment life. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative non-contact measurement method using a visual depth estimation technique based on deep learning. The MiDaS model captures an image of a liquid metal surface by a monocular camera in an industrial environment. A deep neural network then estimates their depth by processing these images. By calculating the vertical distance between the liquid metal level point and a predefined reference point, real-time and accurate monitoring of the liquid level height is realized. This study not only introduces a new non-contact solution for measuring the height of liquid metal surfaces, but also enhances the potential applications of deep learning in industrial vision measurement and depth estimation.},

  abstract = {With the increasing complexity and diversity of network attacks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been employed to address network intrusion detection challenges. However, the performance of these models is constrained by their reliance on a single graph construction approach. To enhance detection accuracy and adaptability to intricate attack patterns, this paper introduces a Multi-Granularity Graph Fusion-based Graph Neural Network (MGF-GNN) model. The model resolves the issue of a single granularity graph structure failing to fully capture the complex relationships and covert attack strategies in network traffic. It constructs three heterogeneous graphs at different granularities to capture traffic relationships from host-level, port-level, and protocol-level perspectives. The model employs hierarchical message passing, aggregation, and cross-graph information fusion mechanisms to strengthen its ability to learn multi-level information, thereby improving detection performance against complex attacks. MGF-GNN outperforms traditional machine learning methods and single-graph-based GNN models on the CIC-IDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 datasets, achieving significant improvements across multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Its effectiveness is primarily attributed to MGF-GNN's ability to comprehensively learn multi-dimensional perspective information through multi-granularity graph fusion.},

  abstract = {Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress and been widely applied across various industries. However, a series of significant challenges have also been posed, such as the hallucination, where the generated attributes of a target are inconsistent with the information in the image. Recent works have primarily focused on improving generation performance by training the multimodal alignment module of the model with additional data. However, this approach incurs higher costs and introduces redundant information due to the reliance on large amounts of additional data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal mitigation framework, termed MH-PEFT. Specifically, we introduce an effective data augmentation strategy that leverages existing data to generate additional attribute-related information, thereby enhancing the model's generative capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a PEFT-based training approach specifically tailored to mitigate multimodal hallucination in LVLMs. Notably, our framework features a plug-and-play design, which enhances its robustness and facilitates its deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.},

However, research on time-series data in the transportation field, particularly on sequence prediction across multiple time scales, remains underexplored. To leverage the multi-scale characteristics of time-series data, as well as its seasonal and periodic features, we introduce two solutions based on DLinear model: multi-scale decomposition and cross-scale information fusion, and propose a traffic prediction model named MIFNetwork. We conduct comparative experiments on several traffic datasets, selecting transformer-based models with strong time-series modeling capabilities for comparison. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other approaches, especially in handling long time spans and complex trend changes.},

However, the emergence of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) introduces unique requirements for assessing information freshness, rendering the traditional AoI definition inadequate. This is because the traditional AoI metric operates under the presumption that each data packet bears equal significance. In contrast, AIoT systems must prioritize the transmission of event summaries from smart IoT devices. To promptly capture events as they occur at the sources, we propose a novel information freshness metric called Age of Event (AoE). Subsequently, we thoroughly investigate the problem of AoE-minimizing transmission scheduling. This issue presents a formidable challenge because the event occurrence pattern can be unpredictable, and more crucially, the base station only becomes aware of these occurrences post-transmission. In response, we formulate algorithms and conduct a theoretical analysis applicable to scenarios characterized by complete, zero, or partial knowledge of event occurrences. Evaluations performed on a real traffic event dataset reveal that even in the absence of complete knowledge, our algorithms exhibit competitive performance when compared against the clairvoyant benchmark and markedly outperform AoI baselines.},

The results reveal that few approaches combine MDE, AI/ML, and DevOps for software and systems engineering. In contrast, several approaches have combined two of them, specifically MDE and DevOps. Approaches combining AI/ML with MDE or DevOps are also becoming more frequent and will most likely continue to progress in the future. These synergies cover a range of engineering activities, from requirements and design to monitoring, maintenance, and evolution. Open research challenges include advancing AI/ML, MDE, and DevOps integration, supporting scalable, data-oriented solutions, proposing new continuous engineering methods, and adapting DevOps practices to diverse systems.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have revolutionized intelligent systems by enabling machines to produce human-like content across diverse domains. However, their outputs often exhibit unpredictability due to complex and opaque internal semantic states, posing challenges for reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce the AI Uncertainty Principle, a novel theoretical framework inspired by quantum mechanics, to model and quantify the inherent unpredictability in generative AI outputs. By drawing parallels with the uncertainty principle and superposition, we formalize the trade-off between the precision of internal semantic states and output variability. Through comprehensive experiments involving state-of-the-art models and a variety of prompt designs, we analyze how factors such as specificity, complexity, tone, and style influence model behavior. Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts can significantly enhance output predictability and consistency, while excessive complexity or irrelevant information can increase uncertainty. We also show that ensemble techniques, such as Sigma-weighted aggregation across models and prompt variations, effectively improve reliability. Our findings have profound implications for the development of intelligent systems, emphasizing the critical role of prompt engineering and theoretical modeling in creating AI technologies that perceive, reason, and act predictably in the real world.},

  abstract = {Neuromorphic computing is a novel computational paradigm that draws inspiration from the structure and function of the human brain. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising approach for implementing energy-efficient Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in embedded systems. In this article, we present ModNEF, an open-source, neuromorphic digital hardware architecture designed for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). ModNEF is based on a modular architecture, where independent modules communicate via point-to-point connections to emulate SNNs. Our architecture offers two neuron models based on the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) model, with a different emulation strategy. The modular nature of ModNEF allows researchers to extend the architecture by developing new modules to emulate different types of neurons or implement online learning rules. ModNEF is a clock-driven emulator, meaning that the neuron state is updated at regular intervals, even in the absence of input data. We evaluated the performance of the emulator using the MNIST and NMNIST datasets, with offline, full-precision training.},

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have emerged to address this challenge, offering the capability to synthesize human motion animations from text prompts. However, the effective integration of AI-generated motion into professional designer workflows remains uncertain. This study proposes MoWa, an authoring tool designed to refine AI-generated human motions to meet professional standards. A formative study with six professional motion designers identified the strengths and weaknesses of AI-generated motions. To address these weaknesses, MoWa utilizes latent space to enhance the expressiveness of motions, making them suitable for use in professional workflows. A user study involving twelve professional motion designers was conducted to evaluate MoWa’s effectiveness in refining AI-generated motions. The results indicated that MoWa streamlines the motion design process and improves the quality of the outcomes. These findings suggest that incorporating latent space into motion design tasks can improve efficiency.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology (IT), the lifestyle of modern society has transformed to a faster pace and is more human-centered. The developments in haptic technology have significantly improved the human-computer interaction. Virtual reality (VR) technology and the metaverse, which highlight personalized experience, have become hotspots of the information application industry. In VR applications, adding haptic feedback to the human-computer interaction process can make the experience more immersive. In recent years, research on virtual haptics has focused on two areas: the use of microcurrents to stimulate mechanoreceptors and the use of virtual haptics to convey information. Multi-channel tactile-force rendering permits realistic touch sensations. This is achieved by utilizing force and tactile feedback methods. It is effective for the users to feel detailed and immersive interactions. This paper presents a detailed review on the developments in microcurrent-based computational frameworks for high-resolution haptic feedback. This work also investigates the modern techniques for high resolution haptic rendering, such as the role of multi-channel simulation and computational modeling techniques. Furthermore, the applications of this technology, challenges, and future directions were elaborated.},

  abstract = {This article considers the role of multi-label medical image classification and the related revolution in clinical diagnosis. Here, the use of deep learning technologies brings up the problem of single-label classification methods that may not be able to deal with the multi-label one as they do not cover the complex, sometimes coexisting, multiple-pathological features in medical images. To address these challenges, we propose the CTTransNet speculative model, a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), which aims to better integrate the local features and the global context. Similarly, a Transformer decoder is used to model inter-label dependencies, and a less-weighted fusing loss mechanism is utilized to deal with the data imbalance issue. The AUC of 81.68\% on the ChestXray14 dataset is achieved by the proposed method, which shows its higher accuracy and superiority to the robustness compared to the traditional methods in multi-label medical image classification. This breakthrough thus brings about the complete information needed for a clinical diagnosis and makes it easier for personalized precision medicine to develop.},

In this study, a multimodal sentiment analysis framework based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology is proposed, aiming at automatically identifying the emotional tendency in online product marketing information. By combining the latest generative AI technology, the model can not only analyze the direct feedback from users, but also capture the potential emotional color. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional single-modal sentiment analysis method, the accuracy of the proposed multimodal model is improved by 15\%, and the recall rate is improved by 12\%. This shows that the model can provide more accurate market insight for enterprises, and help to better understand customer needs, improve product design and optimize marketing strategies. The demonstrated multimodal sentiment analysis framework provides a powerful tool for understanding and responding to consumer sentiment. Future research will further explore how to enhance the generalization ability of the model and how to deal with emotional differences in cross-cultural background more effectively to achieve a wider application in the global scope.},

However, current GAN architectures exhibit limitations in feature fusion efficiency, synthesized image quality, and classification accuracy. In this study, a GAN-based multimodal medical image generation and classification model was constructed. First, features are extracted using multi-scale receptive fields, key channels are enhanced by combining the channel attention mechanism, and the cross-enhanced fusion module realizes the fusion of MRI and PET features. In addition, Generator 3D is responsible for generating realistic medical images and classifying diseases through the classification header. Discriminator 3D is used to discriminate the realism of the images. Meanwhile, a comprehensive loss function is designed to optimize the generator's performance by combining adversarial loss, correlation loss, mean loss, and classification loss. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality medical images and perform well on the classification task.

Museum in the Classroom (MITC) explores how augmented reality (AR) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) can create an interactive learning experience around museum artifacts. This iPad app allows educators to select historical topics from a curated artifact library, generating AR-based exhibits that students can explore. MITC engages students through interactive AR artifacts, AI-driven chatbots, and AI-generated quiz questions, based on a real exhibition at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University. A formative study with middle schoolers (N = 20) demonstrated that the app increased engagement compared to traditional learning methods. MITC also fostered a playful and comfortable environment to interact with museum artifacts. Our findings suggest that combining AR and AI has the potential to enrich classroom learning and offer a scalable alternative to traditional museum visits.},

  abstract = {It has recently emerged that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly developed and can create realistic speech, images, and video. Although such innovations provide many advantages, they pose major threats to the network's security. The research question of the study will, therefore, be the role and effects of generative artificial intelligence on network security, especially deepfake, artificial intelligence-driven phishing, and multimedia content manipulation. This research uses a case study analysis of real-life experiences of security threats in networked systems to show how generative AI can be misused. The findings reveal that: 1. Generative AI can create highly developed cyberattacks such as deepfake social engineering and AI-supplemented phishing, which use visually and audibly persuasive appeals to manipulate users. 2. The problem with this kind of security threat highlighted by AI is that most traditional security solutions lack awareness of such threats since they are incapable of effective real-time user authentication, over-dependence on visual and biometric verification, and lack of AI-awareness training. 3. There are significant gaps in cybersecurity policies and training. Many organizations lack formal protocols for addressing AI-related security risks, and often, organizations are applying generative AI technologies. In addressing the aforementioned vulnerabilities, the study recommends an improved security model that incorporates deepfake detection, more secure authentication, and even advanced anomaly detection systems. In furtherance, there should be improvements in policy that aim at commanding the AI media, ensuring comprehensive training of the employees on cybersecurity matters, and drives that aim at educating the public on how to enhance the strength for discouraging AI cybercrimes.},

The industrial internet is booming. However, due to the increasing complexity of the network environment and various types of cyber attacks, there are huge challenges for the industrial internet. Traditional network security devices adopt isolated protection measures and cannot achieve information sharing, which can only reflect the security of the network from one side. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the current security status of the industrial internet and a prediction of its safety development trend over a certain period are the important directions for the development of industrial internet security.

These models can evaluate students' learning behaviors and knowledge mastery, providing support for personalized learning. Unfortunately, traditional models have their limitations when dealing with complex relational data related mainly to the relationship between students and problems, while the characteristics as well as potential relationships among students are almost left neglected. In response, this paper proposes a Neural Network Student Cognitive Diagnosis Model Based on Multi-Relational Graph (MGNCD) that brings together the powers of Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) to model multi-dimensional heterogeneous nodes such as students, classes, problems, and skills. The introduction of various edge types and random edge connection strategies allowed the model to tackle data sparsity and heterogeneity. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms traditional methods in accuracy (ACC) and area under the curve (AUC), which provides an encouraging novel insight into cognitive diagnosis.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancements of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have recently led to renewed attention towards approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search and vector databases (VectorDB). Among various ANN methodologies, vector quantization techniques like product quantization (PQ) are widely used to generate space-efficient representations for large-scale dense vectors. However, the code-books generated by PQ often reach several gigabytes in size, making them impractical for web-scale, high-dimensional vectors in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices.In this study, we propose SegPQ, a simple yet effective framework for losslessly compressing codebooks generated by any PQ variants, enabling efficient in-memory vector search on devices with limited memory. SegPQ represents the raw PQ codewords as a trained error-bounded piecewise linear approximation model (ϵ-PLA) and pre-computed low-bit residuals. We theoretically demonstrate that, with high probability, the number of bits per compressed codeword is 1.721 + ⌈log2 ϵOPT⌉, where ϵOPT is the optimal error parameter that can be determined by data characteristics. To accelerate query execution, we further design SIMD-aware query processing algorithms on compressed codebooks to fully exploit the hardware parallelism offered by modern architectures. Extensive experimental studies on real datasets showcase that, for 1 billion vectors, SegPQ reduces PQ codebook memory consumption by up to 4.7x (approx. 851 MB) while incurring only 3.3\% additional query processing overhead caused by decompression.},

  abstract = {In creator economy, the online platform posts contract to incentivize creators for high-quality content. The creators can use human effort or Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to assist them to create content for rewards. In this work, we identify that the existing contract suffers from GenAI-Induced Effort Degradation, where creators may not try their best to create high-quality content, but instead turn to GenAI to save effort and extract additional reward. Our results show that GenAI-induced effort degradation arises from failing to provide the same profit for the creators generating the same quality content. With this observation, we design the contract for creator economy in the era of GenAI as a classical contract for human content and a reward for the GenAI content which depends on the estimation of the human effort cost required to achieve GenAI's content quality. To overcome the curse of dimensionality in learning the optimal contract that maximizes platform profit with a high-quality content guarantee, we design an adaptive action pruning method that gradually filters out contracts resulting in low quality. Simulation experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

The problems of scattered data, untimely manual decision-making, and mismatch between employees and positions are becoming more and more common. Management methods that used to rely on personal experience or fixed rules can't keep up with the pace of business changes now. On the other hand, artificial intelligence, especially deep learning algorithm, brings new and promising solutions, which can handle human resources-related work more efficiently and accurately. This paper discusses the main challenges faced by human resource allocation in artificial intelligence environment, introduces how AI technology can help, and puts forward some improvement strategies using XGBoost algorithm. This model is not only supported by survey data, but also tested in actual scenes. The results show that this method works well and can really optimize the allocation of human resources. We hope that through this research, we can provide some practical suggestions for enterprises to adjust their human resource management in the AI era, and help them maintain their competitive advantage and operate more smoothly.},

  abstract = {The utilization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek is bringing about significant changes in educational practices and learning environments. This alteration underlines the necessity to look into how AI can enhance ethics education for the youth. This research reveals that the capabilities of GAI match up well with the requirements of youth ethics education in four principal ways: (1) crafting immersive, multi-sensory scenarios to boost student interest. By creating such scenarios, students can get more engaged and excited about learning. (2) Employing adaptive methods for precise interventions. This means being able to adjust the teaching approach according to each student's specific situation to make the intervention more effective. (3) Generating personalized content to customize the delivery of knowledge. Every student is different, and personalized content can better meet their individual learning needs. (4) Offering real-time analysis to improve teaching methods. With real-time analysis, teachers can quickly understand how students are doing and make timely adjustments. Based on these connections, this study puts forward a framework that incorporates GAI into crucial parts of the teaching process: integrating comprehensive learning data. This helps to have a more complete understanding of students' learning progress. Developing evidence-based strategies. So that teaching decisions are made with solid evidence. Creating differentiated content. To cater to the diverse needs of students. And assessing outcomes in multiple dimensions. This integration not only enhances the efficiency of moral education but also provides a scalable model for applying AI-driven teaching innovations across different subjects.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for natural language understanding and text generation. An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step called LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on improving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as batching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify and map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of both processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators (e.g., GPUs). We observe that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a kernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet user and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and computation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach of designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even in memory-bound kernels.In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the dynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI (PA rallel Decoding with PI M), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that exploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to suitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel characterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware units at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that harmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units (GPU) and hybrid PIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on three broadly-used LLMs (i.e., LLaMA-65B, GPT-3 66B, and GPT-3 175B) show that PAPI achieves 1.8\texttimes{} and 11.1\texttimes{} speedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator (i.e., GPU and PIM) and a state-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively.},

We demonstrate how Paratrouper supports different aspects of the character design process, and share insights from its use by eight creators.

  abstract = {Current research on the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on adolescent development yields mixed results, and parents are left to navigate this emerging technology without clear support and knowledge. A missing step toward effective digital parenting is understanding parents’ concerns and beliefs. Therefore, this preliminary study explores parental perspectives on the use and impact of GenAI on adolescents aged 13 to 17. We conducted a survey with N = 159 parents from 19 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Findings suggest that most parents are unaware of how their children use GenAI and feel disconnected from them on this topic. Importantly, while parents recognise the opportunities and risks of GenAI, their views vary based on their own familiarity with the technology, with those who use it regularly being significantly more optimistic about its impact on adolescents’ development. These results highlight a gap in digital parenting when it comes to adolescents’ use of GenAI, underscoring the need for a systematic approach to parental support. Future work will expand the survey into a larger-scale study and incorporate adolescents’ perspectives.},

This study presents a 'Three-Tier Three-Driver' personalized teaching reform model that categorizes students into three tiers based on different career trajectories and leverages AI as a driver across three dimensions: teaching content, teaching methods, and assessment.Multiple AI tools and methods like AI teaching assistants, GPT models, knowledge graph construction, Q&amp;A modules, and AI assessment modules are used by the course to design the entire curriculum anew, boost pedagogical practice, and reconstruct assessment schemes.Data were collected from a questionnaire survey with 500 students and were modeled using K-Means clustering, DBSCAN density-based clustering algorithms and random forest models. Results demonstrate significant differences in student behaviors and perceptions related to AI tool usage across the different clusters.Effective use of AI technologies was found to benefit student satisfaction and academic performance. Furthermore, there was a significant association found between AI use times and course satisfaction, however DBSCAN could not detect a group of extreme learners.The study concludes by compiling replicable evidence of AI-driven teaching innovation and discussing existing limitations (such as the limited sample scope) as well as possible directions for future work.The conclusion uncovers GAI-empowered teaching innovation as a good promise for teaching quality improvement and personalized learning promotion for postgraduate education.},

  abstract = {Simulation is crucial for developing autonomous driving systems, where AI algorithms process sensor data to perceive environments. However, training these algorithms require vast, diverse data, and existing methods face limitations. Manual scene construction in simulation platforms is slow and lacks scalability, while rendering-based approaches often produce inconsistent image sequences, failing to support high-quality algorithm training. Additionally, such methods cannot synthesize multi-modal data essential for perception models. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes an automated system to generate multi-modal perception data (image, point cloud, vehicle status) by synthesizing diverse 3D scenes within a simulation platform. By directly constructing 3D scene models, the system eliminates perspective inconsistencies inherent in rendering-based methods. Experimental validation showing the system generates consistent, high-quality data for autonomous driving.},

  abstract = {Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3x higher throughput and consumes 2.3x less energy. CENT reduces the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2x more tokens per dollar than GPUs.},

However, current consensus protocols cannot ensure AI enabler quality, crucial for AI-powered distributed blockchain and federated learning. Traditional consensus middleware between network and application layers proves inadequate for AI-focused blockchain and federated learning. Thus, an AI-driven application-level consensus with quality-assured enablers is imperative.We propose Proof-of-INtelligence (PIN), an application-level consensus for AI-based blockchain and federated learning, ensuring AI enabler quality. To the best of our knowledge, PIN pioneers the first AI-centric application-level consensus for distributed environments. Employing enablers like accuracy and training quality, PIN is showcased in the federated learning setup “PIN in BlOckchAin-based fedeRateD learning (PIN-BOARD),” the first AI-specific consensus application in blockchain-based federated learning. Both PIN and PIN-BOARD are the highlights of our contributions to the presented work and emphasize the novelty. PIN is the first AI-centric application-level consensus for blockchain and pioneers decentralized AI assurance; PIN addresses the limitations of existing consensus protocols and advances blockchain-based federated learning through the novel framework called PIN-BOARD. Experimental evaluation involves PIN’s accuracy, confirmation time, and a new AI-assurance factor metric. PIN-BOARD’s assessment includes testing accuracy and reward accuracy. A thorough security analysis ensures the strength of PIN and PIN-BOARD. The comparative evaluation highlights PIN’s 20\% throughput enhancement and efficient artificial index. PIN-BOARD reduces epochs by 28.5\% for peak federated learning accuracy as compared to existing federated models. Thus, PIN emerges as an efficient AI-driven application-level consensus with AI assurance.},

  abstract = {As the scale of agricultural production continues to expand, plant diseases have become a major threat to global agricultural productivity. Although traditional disease detection methods are widely used, they generally suffer from low accuracy and complex operations, making them difficult to meet the needs of modern agriculture. In response to these problems, this article proposes a new deep learning model-LabInt. LabInt uses dual-branch independent convolution in Lab color space, which effectively reduces the impact of illumination changes on feature extraction. Through spatial reconstruction and multi-scale pooling technology, the model can deeply mine shallow disease features and use deep convolution instead of ordinary convolution to reduce computational costs and improve the model's fine-grained identification capabilities. In addition, in order to adapt to complex agricultural environments, LabInt introduces a multi-head self-attention (MHA) mechanism to dynamically enhance attention to disease characteristics and significantly reduce the interference of complex backgrounds. Experimental results show that LabInt exhibits excellent disease recognition performance in actual agricultural production environments, with key indicators such as precision and recall reaching high levels. Ablation studies show that each module makes an important contribution to model performance. Therefore, LabInt is not only innovative in theory, but also shows strong application potential in practice, and is expected to become an important tool to improve the efficiency of agricultural disease prevention and control.},

One such tool, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), is rapidly permeating into people's daily lives and is considered to have the potential to reshape our society. While private organizations are spending huge amounts of money on ChatGPT, its usage in the public domain is still driven by its open access and simple functionality. This study draws on the key concepts of Effective Use theory—Transparent Interaction, Representational Fidelity, Informed Action, and Learning and Adaptation—to examine ChatGPT's current state of diffusion in four public sector domains: transportation, healthcare, agriculture, and law. We find that transparent interaction is better in transportation, agriculture, and law than healthcare; representational fidelity presents a complex picture, whereas informed action has been positive across domains; and learning and adaptation is an ongoing need. We conclude with various suggestions related to research and policy toward boosting GenAI's adoption. We suggest that governments invest resources and develop new regulatory frameworks considering the specific context and use cases for leveraging the enormous potential of GenAI tools in the public domain.},

By integrating quantization into the MPC protocols, PPQformer significantly reduces memory footprint and enhances computational performance while preserving data and model privacy.

As an effective model compression technique, model distillation constructs small-scale student models from large models through knowledge transfer, significantly reducing resource requirements. However, there is a risk of information leakage during the distillation process of the model. This article deeply analyzes the potential mechanisms of information leakage in the distillation process of Transformer, including data reproduction attacks, reverse inference attacks, and other issues. In response to the above risks, a method combining differential privacy technology with secure multi-party computation was proposed for protection, and its effectiveness was verified through experiments. Research has shown that this method can significantly reduce the risk of information leakage while ensuring model performance.},

  abstract = {The rise of deepfake technologies has introduced powerful tools for synthetic face generation, which is often associated with manipulation and privacy violations. However, recently, these generative techniques are repurposed for privacy-preserving applications. This paper presents a structured review of facial anonymization methods that leverage generative models to conceal identity while preserving semantic features, such as expressions and poses. We analyze seven representative studies, comparing their model architectures, alignment with deepfake transformation types, evaluation metrics, and application scenarios. Our review identifies a range of promising technical strategies with particular attention to how recent approaches address demographic fairness, face and body anonymization, and real-world deployment challenges. We underscore the importance of ethically sourced data and policy-aware designs as prerequisites for responsible use. By positioning facial de-identification not only as a technical challenge but also as a sociotechnical necessity, this review outlines a research agenda centered on the privacy, utility, and equitable adoption of generative artificial intelligence systems.},

  abstract = {The emergence of generative and procedural art marks a fundamental shift in creative practice, where the traditional “art-object” (painting, sculpture…) transforms into an “art-subject” paradigm that challenges temporal assumptions about design and futurity. As computational systems evolve beyond mere extensions of human memory and processing capacity, they demonstrate a unique form of creativity that can be characterized as “imachination”—a term that captures the machine’s distinctive approach to creative synthesis, which parallels yet diverges from normative human imagination.This transformation necessitates a reconceptualization of artistic skills and creative agency. While traditional artistic mastery centered on manual dexterity and technical craftsmanship (tekhn\`{e} vs tekhn\`{e}), contemporary practice reveals that manual execution may have restricted the creative process to a temporally and spatially contained form or reification. We may consider that, until the 19th century, the art-object has restrained the canonic practice to using hands as a constraint imposed by the inability to directly project mental concepts through the eyes. Assuming with Leonardo that “la pittura\`{e} cosa mentale”, the art-object translates into the interruption, at a highly specific moment of the mental process putting a full stop to its dynamic expression. Temporality becomes a good way to understand the outcomes of generative media. While the traditional practice focusses on the trace left by the brush stroke or the chisel print in marble, the evidence of “what happened” frozen in time (Roland Barthes’ “\c{C}a a\'{e}t\'{e}” (in La chambre claire), reversely, generative and processual artworks are designed for “what they will come”. Metaphorically we could say that one is the hundred millions years old petrified tree, the other is the seed of promises, thoroughly designed by the artist to open up fields of virtuality. The temporal switch is striking and it doesn’t affect only the artwork, but also the artist forced to reconsider one’s practice.The advent of collective (Pierre Levy) and connective (Derrick de Kerckhove) intelligence introduces creativity models based on unlimited repositories of historical references. This creates a fundamental paradox: we expect creativity to forge new pathways while simultaneously grounding it in comprehensive analysis of existing patterns. The limitations of traditional IQ-based assessments of logical-mathematical intelligence become apparent in this context, neurotypical thinking is a highly normative conception of human thought, and neurodivergent thinking patterns—characterized by rapid, non-linear connections across conceptual spaces—may provide more accurate models for understanding how imachination operates.During this talk, I will present original case studies exploring the conceptual territory of human-machine creative interweaving. Through the definition of conceptual building blocks such as iterative curatorship, egonomy, extended serendipity, critical fusion, artificial intentionality, and maieutic engines, this essay shed light on how human creative role will evolve, not competing with artificial intelligence, but through new forms of human-machine symbiosis that expand the boundaries of creative possibilities, while presenting to the human kind a magic mirror to see its true colors.The investigation draws upon the ancient concept of clinamen–the random disruption of the flow of particles that generates diversity in atomic systems–as a metaphor for understanding how creative divergence functions in both human neurodivergence and artificial intelligence systems. By following these “lines of steepest slope” through the latent spaces of machine learning, we can better comprehend the emerging landscape of augmented creativity and its implications for future artistic practice.},

  abstract = {Recently, as one of the most popular covert communication technologies, generative steganography has received ever-increasing attention due to its promising performance against sophisticated steganalysis tools. However, it is quite difficult for the existing generative steganographic approaches to find a good tradeoff between hiding capacity and extraction accuracy, mainly due to the small capacity of their hiding spaces. To overcome this shortcoming, a Progressive Generative Steganography (PGS) network architecture is proposed to hide a secret message during the progressive image generation process to realize secure covert communication. Specifically, we first propose a robust Secret-to-Noise (S2N) mapping method to encode the secret message as a set of noise maps. Then, guided by these noise maps, a set of corresponding images ranging from low resolution to high resolution are progressively generated by the Single Generative Adversarial Networks (SINGAN). Consequently, a large-sized secret message can be hidden in the finally generated high-resolution image, since a set of high-capacity hiding spaces can be provided by the process of progressive image generation. Moreover, to improve the quality of image generation and the accuracy of secret message extraction, a Dense Secret-Feature Connection (DSFC) strategy is designed and integrated into the proposed PGS network architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PGS outperforms the existing approaches in the aspects of both hiding capacity and message extraction, while maintaining promising anti-detectability and imperceptibility for covert communication.},

The rising popularity of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is likely to further consolidate the power of these companies. The rapid expansion of Big Tech in various domains has triggered a wide range of economic, ethical, and political concerns. However, the US Government is also engaged in a growing technology and AI race with China. As a result, the US government now faces the challenges of balancing the external goal of winning the AI race through close collaboration with the Big Tech and the internal objective of regulating the Big Tech. In this article, we argue that this intersection of interest has been the primary motivator of US policy on the governance of Big Tech. By exploring the evolution of AI policy in the US, we highlight the role internal and external pressures have played in its approach to AI governance.},

While GenAI certainly poses threats to time-honored instructional techniques, it also provides opportunities for new forms of instructional support. In this work, we introduce our strategy for configuring an LLM to serve as a ''rubber duck debugging'' coding assistant to help novice programmers when they encounter difficulties in programming assignments. The key contribution of this work is not in the idea of using LLMs for debugging itself (which has already been demonstrated elsewhere, e.g., [3]) but to demonstrate the ease, flexibility, and pedagogical potential of the strategy. In particular, through carefully crafted prompts and easily accessible platforms, rubber duck LLMs can assist learners with specific questions while also situating those questions alongside larger computer science concepts and computational thinking practices. This work contributes an easily replicated and model-agnostic instructional strategy that productively and responsibly leverages the power of LLMs to assist novice programmers in developing foundational programming skills.},

However, little consideration is given to how to use these models for real-time or cooperative jamming musical applications because of crucial required features: low latency, the ability to communicate planned actions, and the ability to adapt to user input in real-time. To support these needs, we introduce ReaLJam, an interface and protocol for live musical jamming sessions between a human and a Transformer-based AI agent trained with reinforcement learning. We enable real-time interactions using the concept of anticipation, where the agent continually predicts how the performance will unfold and visually conveys its plan to the user. We conduct a user study where experienced musicians jam in real-time with the agent through ReaLJam. Our results demonstrate that ReaLJam enables enjoyable and musically interesting sessions, and we uncover important takeaways for future work.},

  abstract = {Responsible prompt engineering has emerged as a critical pracitce for ensuring that generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are aligned with ethical, legal, and social principles. As generative AI applications become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, the way we instruct and interact with them through prompts has profound implications for fairness, accountability, and transparency. It is, therefore, necessary to examine how strategic prompt engineering can embed ethical and legal considerations and societal values directly into AI interactions, moving beyond mere technical optimization for functionality. This article proposes “Reflexive Prompt Engineering”, a comprehensive framework for responsible prompt engineering that encompasses five interconnected components: prompt design, system selection, system configuration, performance evaluation, and prompt management. Drawing from empirical evidence, the paper demonstrates how each component can be leveraged to promote improved societal outcomes while mitigating potential risks. The analysis reveals that effective prompt engineering requires a delicate balance between technical precision and ethical consciousness, combining the systematic rigor and focus on functionality with the nuanced understanding of social impact. Through examination of emerging practices, this article illustrates how responsible prompt engineering serves as a crucial connection between AI development and deployment, enabling organizations to align AI outputs without modifying underlying model architectures. This approach links with broader “Responsibility by Design” principles, embedding ethical considerations directly into the implementation process rather than treating them as post-hoc additions. The article concludes by identifying key research directions and practical guidelines for advancing the field of responsible prompt engineering as an essential component of AI literacy.},

This article designs and proposes an author influence recognition algorithm based on open review, which analyzes the text of open review content on social media and forms multiple different label clusters to represent the author's different characteristics, thereby achieving multi angle recognition of author influence. Finally, this article conducted empirical research and application using the F1000 open review platform, and the results showed that the proposed algorithm can assign multiple label scores to each author, achieving multi angle recognition of author influence, making author influence more comprehensive and three-dimensional. Through relevant analysis with traditional identification methods, the author believes that the open review recognition algorithm can play a certain complementary role in identifying author influence. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the open review algorithm into the existing author influence evaluation and recognition system, so as to more comprehensively and vividly reflect the author's influence and personal characteristics, better provide and recommend truly high-quality and excellent authors and articles to the academic community, and promote the healthy dissemination of science.},

Under such a background, translation quality evaluation system relying on deep learning has gradually become a hot research topic in the field of translation research. Traditional manual evaluation methods have their own shortcomings, which are relatively subjective and low evaluation efficiency. The existing automatic assessment indicators such as BLEU and METEOR, which have deficiencies in cultural adaptability and logical coherence, cannot meet the complex needs of Sino-French alternating interpretation. This evaluation system combines multi-modal analysis with cross-language and cultural feature database. Based on the improvement of Transformer model architecture, a hierarchical evaluation mechanism is designed, which significantly improves the objectivity of evaluation and makes the evaluation more comprehensive. The experimental results show that this system has more advantages than the traditional method in the three core indicators of accuracy, fluency and cultural adaptability. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the score of this system and the human score reaches 0.87, which proves that it is effective in cross-language and cultural adaptation scenarios. This study provides an extensible technical framework for the assessment of translation quality, and provides innovative solutions to the challenges of linguistic structural differences and cultural metaphor translation.},

This approach solves the complex access control challenges arising from data sharing and large number of users in power grid regulation systems. First, the Aprior algorithm is used to mine strong association rules from the user authority relationship to reveal the potential relationship between resources. Then, the user rights relationship is enhanced, resource similarity is calculated, and collaborative filtering is used to generate recommended values for unauthorized resources. Finally, the access control policy is classified and authorized according to the recommended value, and the automatic generation of the policy is realized. The experimental results show that this method can not only generate access control policies automatically, but also assign new permissions effectively and ensure the privacy of resource data.},

This study explores the behavioral characteristics and text generation quality of college students when using generative AI tools, and proposes an integrated research framework that combines natural language processing (NLP), cluster analysis, and regression models. This study uses 200 students from a university in Guangdong as the research dataset, uses the BERT model to quantify the fluency, relevance, and creativity of generated texts, and uses the K-means algorithm to classify students' behaviors into three categories: high-frequency learners, low-frequency casual users, and mixed users. The experimental results show that the text quality under different task types is significantly different. For example, the scenarios of writing summary generation and creative writing are different. The summary generation task has the highest score in relevance (90 points), while the creative writing task performs well in creativity (85 points). Subsequent regression analysis found that professional background and technical attitude are key factors affecting behavioral patterns. Students of science and engineering tend to frequently use generative AI tools for complex tasks, while students of humanities pay more attention to language fluency and creativity.},

Enhancing the capability for early warning of online public opinion crises is urgent. The most effective approach is to identify potential crises in their early stages and implement corresponding management measures. This study establishes a preliminary indicator system for online public opinion early warning, based on the principles of indicator system construction and the characteristics and evolution patterns of online public opinion. Subsequently, data-driven methodologies were employed to collect and preprocess public opinion indicator data. Utilizing grey relational analysis and the K-Means clustering algorithm, we classified online public opinion events into three levels: slight, warning, and severe. Furthermore, we constructed an online topic evolution model using the online Hierarchical Dirichlet Process model to analyze the thematic changes of online public opinion events across different warning levels. Finally, we developed an online public opinion early warning model using a Backpropagation (BP) neural network. The test results of early warning samples show that the model achieves high accuracy. Thus, in practical early warning applications, the BP neural network can be effectively utilized for predicting online public opinion events.},

  abstract = {Aiming at the traditional fall detection algorithms that suffer from low detection accuracy and poor real-time performance in dealing with small targets and multi-scale features in complex scenes, this study proposes a fall detection algorithm based on an improved YOLOv8 model. First, the SCConv module is utilized to combine with the C2f module in the YOLOv8 backbone network to construct the C2fSC module, which enhances the feature extraction capability of the model while reducing the computational complexity. Second, the SPPF module is integrated with the BAM attention mechanism to weaken the influence of background interference. Finally, WIoU is used to replace the original loss function to optimize the positioning accuracy of the bounding box and enhance the overall performance of the model. The experimental results show that compared with the original YOLOv8 model, the improved model improves 4.9\%, 4.2\%, and 4.4\% in P, R, and mAP metrics, respectively, and the number of parameters and FLOPs are only 2.8M and 7.7G, which proves that the improved model has excellent robustness and effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Under the dual challenges of intelligent transformation and insufficient profitability of automobile manufacturing industry, the traditional financial control model is difficult to adapt to the dynamic market environment due to the problems of data silo and decision-making lag. Based on the framework of dynamic capability theory and the exploratory case of XX Automobile, this study adopts big data technology, machine learning algorithms, and combines blockchain, Internet of Things, database and other information technologies to systematically reveal the intrinsic mechanism of financial control innovation driven by the integration of industry finance and tax. The study found that: (1) Dynamic capabilities empower financial control innovation through the three phases of "sensing-capturing-reconstructing": Relying on big data technology to accurately identify the core drivers of ROE downturn, using machine learning models (decision tree, K-means clustering) to optimize the forecast of capital demand and supplier screening, and reorganizing the financial control innovation with the help of blockchain and distributed database (MongoDB), the study found that: (2) The dynamic ability of the financial management system is a key factor in financial management innovation. With the help of blockchain and distributed database (MongoDB), the company reconstructs the whole value chain process of procurement, cost and sales, and realizes the in-depth synergy of industry finance and tax data. (2) At the practical level, green bond financing reduces capital costs by 30\%, intelligent production line siting model significantly improves work efficiency and reduces carbon emissions by 117,300 tons, and RFM analysis and regression analysis accurately locate high-value customers and Belt and Road potential markets to promote export revenue growth. The conclusion of the study shows that dynamic capability theory provides an innovative path of "technology empowerment-decision optimization-strategic leap" for the integration of industry finance and tax, which not only verifies its theoretical applicability in the field of finance, but also provides a replicable practical paradigm for digital transformation of the automobile manufacturing industry, and at the same time contributes to the strategic insights of green finance and ESG governance.},

Traditional performance appraisal methods often have problems such as single data dimension and subjective setting of appraisal indicators, making it difficult to effectively evaluate the synergy between finance and business. To this end, this paper proposes an intelligent performance evaluation method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) to improve the intelligence level of the appraisal system. The study uses conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to construct a performance evaluation framework, establishes a high-dimensional performance scoring model through the collaborative input of business data and financial data, and optimizes the rationality and accuracy of the scoring results under the adversarial training mechanism. Experiments show that compared with traditional linear regression models and decision tree models, the performance appraisal scoring error generated by GAN is reduced by 18.4\%, and the performance prediction accuracy is increased by 21.7\%. This method can effectively improve the scientific nature of enterprise performance appraisal, promote the in-depth development of business-finance integration, and provide theoretical support and practical guidance for enterprise intelligent management.},

This paper presents a technique for developing personalized dialogue in intelligent customer service applications to the insurance business. Our model establishes an insurance knowledge base and utilizes the retrieval-augmented generation approach. In addition, we create dynamic memory by connecting the long short-term memory module, allowing the system to retrieve and modify customer's information while interacting with them in real time. As a result, intelligent models offer much more natural and engaging conversations, adjusting to specific tones and retaining individual emotions. These virtual assistants customize the responses according to the customer profiles. Hence, they give appropriate, professional, and personalized insurance advice.},

  abstract = {The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and higher education is revolutionising the paradigm of traditional teaching and learning, this paper proposes a novel framework on top of previous research by means of an advanced dialogue system empowered by attentional mechanisms in the field of Artificial Intelligence in which an AI-driven dialogue agent dynamically evaluates student responses over multiple interactions,using attentional mechanisms to identify key semantic patterns, from conceptual comprehension to logical coherence.The system calibrates student responses through iterative scoring and averaging to build adaptive learner profiles that accurately categorise students into five levels at different proficiency levels (e.g., introductory, basic, intermediate, advanced, proficient).In addition to automated assessment, this approach facilitates personalised learning interventions: high-achieving students receive tailored resources for intellectual development, while students with learning difficulties receive targeted remediation through micro-lessons curated by AI. Technological innovations include a hybrid architecture combining a bi-directional GRU network with a context-aware attention layer optimised to detect subtle awareness gaps in open academic discourse.As higher education struggles to respond to the needs of a mass and diverse learner population, this research highlights how AI's dual role as an analytical tool and instructional partner transforms classrooms into responsive ecosystems where every conversation shapes tomorrow's learning trajectory.},

To address this issue, a "User-Involved Real-Time Interactive System for Digital Humans" has been developed. The system integrates multimodal data acquisition devices—such as thermal sensors, visual cameras, and heart rate trackers—with advanced generative artificial intelligence models. By processing user-specific physiological characteristics and behavioral tendencies, the system dynamically generates personalized virtual entities. This approach empowers individuals from mere recipients of digital content to active participants in its creation. Furthermore, leveraging the TouchDesigner platform, the system constructs mixed-reality settings. Through the integration of sensor-based hardware and ComfyUI processing pipelines, it ensures immediate synchronization between users' real-time inputs and the generation of corresponding virtual characters. Experimental results demonstrate that the system enhances user immersion, engagement, and emotional satisfaction through visual editing, driving the evolution from static identity models to real-time dynamic systems and offering novel pathways for technological value conversion.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, its application in the field of language culture and visual presentation has attracted widespread attention. As an important part of China's regional culture, the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing have unique phonetic, lexical and grammatical characteristics. However, with the advancement of modernization, the inheritance and revitalization of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing face many challenges. This paper takes the visual transformation of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing as the research object, and explores how to integrate artificial intelligence technology into the workshop design strategy with the visual transformation of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing as the research object, so as to achieve the symbolic translation and multi-dimensional visualization presentation of the dialects. The study first extracted the representative vocabulary of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing and analyzed their visual transformation needs. Combining the advantages of artificial intelligence technology, the action research method was used to establish a workshop based on a multimodal transformation framework such as speech recognition and image generation. Through case analysis and practical verification, this paper demonstrates the application effect of artificial intelligence technology in the dialect visual transformation workshop, including the visualization of dialect words, the visualization of dialect stories, and the interactive experience of dialect culture. The research conclusion is: the icons generated by generative artificial intelligence integrated into the visual transformation of dialects can be seen to have more concrete symbols and fewer symbolic symbols. These will gradually change as the participants are "tamed" by artificial intelligence. In the graphic symbols generated by combining symbols, we can find two types of combination: international symbols and regional symbols. This provides an experimental paradigm for the design with dialect as the carrier, and also provides a reference for the discussion of the spread and regeneration of dialect.},

  abstract = {In the contemporary flourishing digital economy, advancements in artificial intelligence are incessantly reconfiguring the capital market landscape. This study commences with the industry perturbation instigated by the DeepSeek large - model to explore the interactive mechanisms between financial public opinion and capital markets during technological innovation events. Through the comprehensive utilization of methods such as literature review, case analysis, social network analysis, and regression analysis, and drawing on 12,329 Weibo public opinion data points and high - frequency trading data from 16 A - share DeepSeek concept stocks, a novel “technology decoding – market response” dual - path model is constructed. The study reveals that technology - related public opinion gradually infiltrates the financial domain via a three - stage progression: “professional decoding – industry restructuring – investment decision - making.” Technology bloggers assume a pivotal role in information dissemination, as evidenced by an intermediary centrality of 0.29. The data further indicate that for each one - standard - deviation increment in public opinion intensity, the excess return of concept stocks surges by 1.8\% after 36 hours (p = 0.03), whereas the impact of sentiment polarity on stock prices is not statistically significant (β = 0.04, p = 0.41).Adopting an integrated perspective from journalism and behavioral finance, this research elucidates the propagation patterns of technology - related public opinion and its inherent connections with capital markets, and it formulates a “technology–finance” public opinion governance framework. These findings provide crucial theoretical underpinnings and practical guidelines for the prevention of financial risks associated with technology - related public opinion, thereby having far - reaching implications for optimizing financial market regulation and enhancing public opinion management systems.},

  abstract = {Improving undergraduate students' ability to cope with cyber risks is one of the key issues to be addressed in the digital transformation of higher education in the era of generative artificial intelligence. In order to explore how to improve undergraduate students' ability to cope with information security threats brought about by generative artificial intelligence, this paper constructs a theoretical model for improving undergraduate students' information security behaviour in the context of generative artificial intelligence by integrating the theory of protective motivation, the theory of planned behaviour, and the theory of social cognition. Based on 354 questionnaire survey data, this study systematically analyses the influencing factors and mechanisms of undergraduate students' information security in the context of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that perceived threat, subjective norms and self-efficacy have a positive influence on students' information security behaviour intention, which in turn has a positive influence on their information security behaviour implementation, with environmental support playing a moderating role between the two. The findings of the study help to further improve the theoretical model of undergraduate students' information security behaviour in the context of artificial intelligence, and at the same time provide valuable insights for education departments and colleges and universities to take effective measures to improve undergraduate students' information security capabilities in the era of generating artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {This paper takes the group standards of China's artificial intelligence-related industries as the research object and analyzes the characteristics of participating drafting units and group standard organizations in the group standard cooperation network based on the structural characteristics such as centrality and network density obtained from social network analysis. The study finds that although the development time of group standards in China's artificial intelligence-related industries is short, the development is rapid, and the cooperation network has basically taken shape. The central positions of some group standard organizations and participating drafting units have been initially formed. However, it can also be seen that some group standard organizations, despite having a close relationship with participating drafting units, have not yet established connections with the overall network, indicating that the overall cooperation network is still loose, and only some group standard organizations play relatively key roles in constructing the network for the formulation of group standards in the artificial intelligence-related industries. In the process of promoting the maturity of the cooperation network of group standards in artificial intelligence-related industries, there are still many challenges and room for optimization. On the one hand, it is urgent to take effective measures to strengthen the connections among all entities within the network, reduce the looseness of the network, and improve the overall collaborative efficiency, such as establishing an information sharing platform. On the other hand, group standard organizations and participating drafting units in central positions should give full play to their leading and exemplary roles, and drive the common development of other entities within the network through means such as technical assistance and experience sharing. In addition, the government and industry associations should also play an active role by introducing targeted policies and regulations to guide the formulation and implementation of group standards for artificial intelligence, urging all parties involved to strengthen cooperation and build a more complete standard system. Looking ahead, with the continuous deepening of collaborative governance by all parties, the cooperation network of group standards in the artificial intelligence industry will continue to be optimized and upgraded. It will not only promote the high-quality development of China's artificial intelligence industry but also demonstrate China's wisdom in the field of global artificial intelligence standard setting and enhance China's international discourse power and influence in this field.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of the digital economy, the efficiency, security and transparency of the platform have become increasingly important. Traditional platforms often encounter some problems when processing large amounts of user data, such as data insecurity, information asymmetry, and slow service response. To solve these problems, we proposed a new service model optimization method that combines cluster analysis with blockchain technology to improve the platform's operating efficiency and service quality. In the study, we used several common clustering algorithms, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering, to analyze user behavior data on digital platforms and find different user behavior patterns. At the same time, we also introduced blockchain technology to ensure that data can be stored and managed securely. Through its decentralized mechanism and smart contracts, we automated some processes and reduced manual operations. In the experimental phase, we collected 3,000 user behavior data from China's JD platform. Through cluster analysis, we divided users into several different groups based on their behavioral characteristics, and then combined blockchain technology to optimize the service processes of these user groups. The effect of this combination strategy is very obvious. The experimental results show that cluster analysis can effectively identify the differentiated needs of different user groups, and blockchain technology has brought significant improvements in data security, transparency and overall service efficiency. However, it should be said that the system will become a bit complicated after the introduction of blockchain.},

The main curative treatment for locally advanced patients who cannot undergo surgery relies on radiotherapy but target delineation using traditional CT faces challenges related to physician skill and lacks adequate predictive dimensions for treatment outcomes. The integration of artificial intelligence technologies with multimodal imaging has become more common to enhance both target delineation precision and treatment effectiveness prediction. The functional imaging capabilities of PET/CT and MRI help doctors evaluate suspicious metastatic lymph nodes and separate tumors from atelectasis or inflammation through metabolic and microstructural information. Deep learning algorithms enable radiomics models to extract image-based high-dimensional features which predict local control rates and survival outcomes and other clinical results. The current implementation of AI-assisted multimodal imaging in NSCLC radiotherapy faces multiple challenges including non-standardized data and inadequate model interpretability and insufficient clinical workflow integration. Further radiomics and multi-omics research needs urgent attention especially when radiotherapy combines with immunotherapy or targeted therapy. The future development requires three main steps: enhancing large-scale multicenter data sharing for external validation and developing interpretable AI algorithms and individualized adaptive radiotherapy strategies while promoting standardized clinical AI-assisted multimodal imaging applications to achieve precise and efficient NSCLC radiotherapy.},

The review study narrates research on AI-driven approaches: machine learning, deep learning, federated learning, and generative algorithms (GAs) for fault diagnosis. Internet of Things (IoT) enabled real-time monitoring and intelligence maintenance techniques. Recurrent neural networks particularly long short-term memory (LSTM) models and ML techniques analyse the sensor data for prediction of stress, wear, and failure modes of components, achieving high accuracy and enabling proactive interventions. The results reveal that IoT networks coupled with AI approaches continuously monitor critical parameters including vibration and temperature. This study reveals that optimization techniques, genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization play significant roles in enhancing the structural design of components like gears and connecting rods that achieve weight reductions without compromising safety. This study identifies challenges of model interpretability, data scarcity, and regulatory compliance. These issues are addressed by proposing hybrid AI models and federated learning. Emerging trends include self-healing materials, quantum ML approaches, and automated maintenance systems, which could transform safety in the aviation industry. By bridging research gaps between engineering practices and data-driven insights, this study shows that AI can play a vital role in advancing the efficiency and reliability of drive mechanisms in next-generation aircraft, compliance with aviation protocols, and paving the way for adaptive and autonomous systems.},

  abstract = {Human-Computer Interaction practitioners have been proposing best practices in user interface design for decades. However, generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) brings additional design considerations and currently lacks sufficient user guidance regarding affordances, inputs, and outputs. In this context, we developed a recommender system to promote responsible AI (RAI) practices while people prompt GenAI systems. We detail 10 interviews with IT professionals, the resulting recommender system developed, and 20 user sessions with IT professionals interacting with our prompt recommendations. Results indicate that responsible prompting recommendations have the potential to support novice prompt engineers and raise awareness about RAI in prompting-time. They also suggest that recommendations should simultaneously maximize both a prompt’s similarity to a user’s input as well as a diversity of associated social values provided. These findings contribute to RAI by offering practical ways to provide user guidance and enrich human-GenAI interaction via prompt recommendations.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence are driving a significant transformation in information retrieval and content generation, creating substantial opportunities for online advertising. Text-to-image generation technology has become increasingly prevalent in advertising content production, demonstrating promising performance improvements in terms of semantic relevance and visual appeal. However, existing models often suffer from inadequate representation of entity concepts, such as prominent product brands and recognizable landmarks. This inherent limitation subsequently leads to notable deficiencies in brand tonality, industry-specific relevance, and market adaptability of the generated advertising content. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal ad content generation framework specifically engineered for online advertising system, particularly focused on resolving the deficiency in entity concepts. Our framework is comprised of two phases: first, an image captioning module with entity-aware learning based on multimodal large language model, leveraging retrieval-augmented techniques to incorporate entity concepts into image descriptions; second, a text-to-image diffusion model refined on image-text pairs enriched with entity concepts to facilitate entity-grounded image generation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance in both image captioning and image generation compared to existing methods, particularly in the accuracy of depiction of relevant entities in advertising images. Moreover, the deployment of the framework in the system primary traffic of Baidu Search Ads, has brought significant enhancements to advertisement revenue for both advertisers and the platform.},

  abstract = {The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) represents a paradigm shift in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. This change revolutionizes how buildings are designed, constructed, and managed throughout their lifecycle. Using secondary data, this research aims to evaluate the current advances in the role of AI in BIM, emphasizing leveraging AI to improve organizational performance, decision-making, and project delivery. Based on the four classifications of AI systems which are Reactive AI, Limited Memory AI, Theory of Mind AI, and Self-Aware AI, this study analyzed the prospects of BIM applications. Results show that AI in BIM applications offers capabilities across domains such as generative design, predictive maintenance, energy optimization, automated code compliance, clash detection, construction simulation, sustainability analysis, project risk assessment, facility management, and natural language processing. The research also presents major issues arising from the integration of AI in a BIM setting, including Interoperability problems, Data management problems, and Technological resistance problems. Based on the evaluation of the current status and challenges associated with AI integration, this work expects to offer practical recommendations for the stakeholders interested in implementing AI technologies within their BIM projects. In addition, the research reveals new directions in integrating AI into BIM, including digital twins and generative design that will likely transform the project lifecycle. This research fills the gap in the current literature by exploring the AI limitations and opportunities in BIM environments and thereby provides insights into the application of these technologies to enhance innovation and sustainability in construction. Finally, this research provides a basis for new and more rational approaches to construction that would meet the needs of contemporary society.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have infiltrated most aspects of our lives and the technologies we use, including social media. Content (and moderation thereof) on many popular social media platforms is currently a mix of human- and AI-generated. Depending on many technical, situational, and contextual factors, both human- and AI-generated content on social media platforms have the potential to either fuel or fight the stigmatization of marginalized groups. Stigmatization is the social process of stereotyping, devaluing, or marginalizing individuals or groups based on certain characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, religion, or race, which can lead to social exclusion and psychological damage. The impact of AI agents on either reinforcing or reducing existing stigmatization on social media platforms remains largely unknown within our scholarly community. We have even less understanding of how to design and implement AI agents that can actively help transform social media platforms into spaces for combating stigmatization while empowering marginalized groups. In this editorial, we call on the information systems (IS) community to conduct empirical, design, and theoretical research at the intersection of social media, specific AI systems or agents, and marginalized contexts. Advancing research in this space is critical to understanding and shaping the future of social media platforms as a social good and as places to reduce stigmatization.},

It can integrate data wisdom, educational wisdom, and cultural wisdom to achieve the precision, creation, and optimization of education, and cultivate learners' wisdom literacy. Due to the potential problems in algorithm, calculation data, and computing power and other aspects of problems in intelligent technology, as well as due to human-related factors such as emotional barriers and management's losing control, wisdom education in the era of digital intelligence faces many risks. This paper applies the methods of philosophical speculation, ethical analysis, emotional analysis, and teaching pathology analysis to study the four major risks in them. (alienation of educational nature, human-machine ethical anomie, lack of artificial emotion, and pathological teaching), and intending to find the resolutions of the corresponding risks in wisdom education. The supposed resolutions are empowering the human-like nature of educational artificial intelligence and combining it with moral education to obtain a complete educaitonal nature of wisdom education; strengthening the governance of human-machine ethics from the source of risk (participants) through the utilization of intelligent educational ethical norms; combining human emotions with artificial emotions to establish a soul that is inclined to goodness of intelligent education; inhibiting pathogenic factors and enhancing disease resistance factors treat teaching diseases and prevent effectively through various therapies.},

For this, our setup consists of a small robotic arm that is connected to a computer to press and release the keys on an electric piano. The computer sends the controlling signals to the robot based on an artificial intelligence-based computer vision pipeline. The potential elements in the different stages of the pipeline were compared to each other in terms of accuracy, efficiency and model parameters, and were chosen accordingly. Our pipeline consists of models for three main functionalities: hand keypoint detection (MediaPipe); static hand signal recognition (a custom MLP model); and dynamic gesture recognition (a GRU model with semantic fusion). This way, our application can recognize the seven hand signals that are based on Kod\'{a}ly’s work, and with the forth and back movement understand the intent of key-press and release of a music note. The system presented high accuracy in the recognition of the hand signals and also the gestures, thus enabling fluent usage in music education.},

However, their scale and complexity pose significant challenges for processing and analysis. In this paper we discuss our experiences in developing and using a scientific research application using an automated multi-facility workflow that orchestrates data collection, preprocessing, artificial intelligence (AI) inferencing, and data movement across diverse computational resources, leveraging the Advanced Computing Ecosystem Testbed at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF). We demonstrate that our workflow can be seamlessly integrated and orchestrated across research facilities managed by different federal agencies, thus allowing users to extract new scientific insights from climate datasets. The experimental results indicate that the multi-facility workflow significantly reduces processing time, enhances scalability, and maintains high efficiency across varying workloads. Notably, our workflow processes 12,000 high-resolution satellite images in just 44 seconds using 80 workers distributed across 10 nodes on the OLCF systems. Such high throughput is essential for dynamic tokenization and sharding of petascale satellite data for distributed AI model training and inferencing at scale across thousands of GPUs.},

  abstract = {As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) becomes an increasingly significant part of young people’s lives, educators worry about its impact on learning and attainment. However, understanding this impact requires more than simply studying young people’s behaviours or soliciting their opinions. It is essential to involve them actively as co-researchers, allowing their unique perspectives to shape the conversation around GenAI in schools. This project moves beyond seeing young people as research subjects, positioning them instead as co-designers, co-researchers, and potential influencers of national policy on GenAI in education. We recruited eight young people (aged 16–18) from three Scottish high schools to serve as Young People Co-Researchers (YPCR). Together, we explored their perspectives on GenAI at school, including their current usage, views on appropriate tasks for AI, and opinions on teachers’ use of AI. The YPCR organised and conducted semi-structured focus groups with 50 peers and collaboratively analysed the findings with adult researchers. Our results show that young people are cautiously optimistic about GenAI’s potential for learning and do not support outright bans in schools. They clearly distinguish between AI use for learning and in assessments, often expressing confusion over current policies and wishing for clearer guidance. The YPCR stated a strong desire to deepen their understanding of AI’s advantages and risks and for schools to teach responsible, effective use. Their insights are valuable for national policy development and for AI literacy initiatives.},

The work flow of this scheme is described in detail and evaluated by experiment. The security analysis shows that the scheme can effectively resist various security threats and protect the privacy of agricultural data. The accuracy analysis shows that the training accuracy of the model is almost unaffected while the safety is improved. Homomorphic encryption analysis verifies the effectiveness of the encryption technology in the scheme.

  abstract = {Flow-guided Localization (FGL) enables the identification of spatial regions within the human body that contain an event of diagnostic interest. FGL does that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations. Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets, enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models, including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels, and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust and scalable nanoscale localization.},

  abstract = {Sketch mapping is an effective technique to externalize and communicate spatial information. However, it has been limited to 2D mediums, making it difficult to represent 3D information, particularly for terrains with elevation changes. We present Sketch2Terrain, an intuitive generative-3D-sketch-mapping system combining freehand sketching with generative Artificial Intelligence that radically changes sketch map creation and representation using Augmented Reality. Sketch2Terrain empowers non-experts to create unambiguous sketch maps of natural environments and provides a homogeneous interface for researchers to collect data and conduct experiments. A between-subject study (N=36) revealed that generative-3D-sketch-mapping improved efficiency by 38.4\%, terrain-topology accuracy by 12.5\%, and landmark accuracy by up to 12.1\%, with only a 4.7\% trade-off in terrain-elevation accuracy compared to freehand 3D-sketch-mapping. Additionally, generative-3D-sketch-mapping reduced perceived strain by 60.5\% and stress by 39.5\% over 2D-sketch-mapping. These findings underscore potential applications of generative-3D-sketch-mapping for in-depth understanding and accurate representation of vertically complex environments. The implementation is publicly available.},

However, our formative study highlights the challenges for non-expert users in crafting appropriate prompts and specifying fine-grained spatial conditions (e.g., depth or canny references) to generate semantically cohesive images, especially when multiple objects are involved. In response, we introduce SketchFlex, an interactive system designed to improve the flexibility of spatially conditioned image generation using rough region sketches. The system automatically infers user prompts with rational descriptions within a semantic space enriched by crowd-sourced object attributes and relationships. Additionally, SketchFlex refines users’ rough sketches into canny-based shape anchors, ensuring the generation quality and alignment of user intentions. Experimental results demonstrate that SketchFlex achieves more cohesive image generations than end-to-end models, meanwhile significantly reducing cognitive load and better matching user intentions compared to region-based generation baseline.},

  abstract = {The automatic spindle detection algorithm based on deep learning technology requires high consistency of sleep spindle annotation, which crowdsourcing can significantly enhance through collective intelligence. To best of our knowledge, few studies have explored auto detection of sleep spindles based on crowdsourced datasets. MODA is the only crowdsourcing spindle annotation open access dataset until now, and this study utilized the MODA dataset to further enhance the automatic detection of sleep spindles using conventional neural network (CNN) and innovative label optimization module. To evaluate our model, we proposed and conducted two analysis methods including analysis by sample-event and by subject. Meanwhile, to validate our performance of our model, SUMO and EXP were considered as control and gold standard methods respectively; and various metrics related to by sample-event and by subject were compared among our model, SUMO and EXP. The results from analysis by sample-event showed that F1 score, Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and Cohen's Kappa coefficient in our model were significantly higher than in SUMO under all overlap thresholds. Specifically, under a higher threshold of 0.6, F1, MCC and Kappa reached 0.82, 0.81, 0.81 in our model, 0.75, 0.74, 0.74 in SUMO, respectively. For analysis by subject, all spindle features extraction of our model were comparable to the EXP, including density (4.48 in our model vs 3.80 in EXP), duration (0.79 vs 0.84), amplitude (29.91 vs 30.09) and frequency (13.04 vs 12.92). However, the spindle density extracted by SUMO was significantly different from EXP (9.04 in SUMO vs 3.80 in EXP). In conclusion, our results suggested that the crowdsourced public dataset and label optimization module can further enhance the spindle detection capability of the convolutional neural network.},

This paper proposes SLP-SLAM, a multifeature fusion stereo simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system that combines both structural lines and structural planes. We have enhanced the effectiveness of the method for extracting structural lines using the Manhattan World Assumption (MWA) and have suggested utilizing these lines to construct structural planes, which is different from the existing plane extraction methods. Furthermore, we develop the state estimator by minimizing the visual residuals of points, structural lines, and structural planes. As far as we know, this represents the inaugural stereo SLAM that concurrently employs points, structural lines, and structural planes for integrated optimization. An appraisal of our system on difficult public datasets has been conducted. The trajectory error associated with SLP-SLAM has been diminished by 15\% in comparison to contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) SLAM.},

On one hand, GenAI tools can be used to create synthetic content legitimately. For example, advertising agencies may, with permission, generate celebrities’ images or videos using GenAI tools without putting them in front of cameras and thus reducing the overall cost of media construction. On the other hand, scammers may utilize GenAI tools to craft or edit artificial content (for example, texts, images, videos, or audio), so-called deepfakes, to mislead or deceive netizens with robocalls or voice cloning phishing, potentially causing detrimental consequences for society. This article briefly debates emerging socioeconomic threats of deepfakes in today’s society and how cyber-wellness (or digital media literacy) education can help netizens mitigate their risks.To the mitigate the risks of deepfakes, enhanced cyber-wellness programs are needed that empower both producers and consumers of generative AI–based content.},

However, medical data often suffer from class imbalance, which can affect the performance of models. In this paper, we first introduce a novel privacy-preserving federated learning scheme that addresses the class imbalance problem through both feature learning and classifier learning. In the feature learning stage, two feature extraction networks are used in parallel and optimized. Finally, in the classifier learning stage, multiple loss functions are designed to ensure balanced learning across all classes. Experimental results on a publicly available skin dataset with simulated multi-source medical image data demonstrate outstanding performance in handling class imbalance. The model achieves balanced classification accuracy, overall accuracy, and F1 score of 87.02\%, 88.27\%, and 87.33\%, respectively. Compared to other models, the balanced accuracy, overall accuracy, and F1 score are improved by 8.71\%, 3.61\%, and 8.23\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Spectrum anomaly detection involves identifying abnormal signals within the electromagnetic spectrum. Most existing methods focus on traditional abnormal signals and can achieve high detection rates through training and testing of neural network models. However, the presence of adversarial samples greatly reduces the performance of existing network models. To address this issue, a spectrum anomaly detection algorithm based on attention mechanism residual neural network is proposed, which can significantly improve the robustness of network models without adversarial training. This method integrates the attention mechanism module and the Residual Network (ResNet), using ResNet18 to process spectrogram data, avoiding gradient vanishing and overfitting during iteration, and using attention mechanism to enhance the model's attention to local information in spectrogram data. The experimental results show that the predictive performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to the compared algorithms. Compared with ResNet18 and feature transformation based image retrieval adversarial defense algorithms, the new algorithm has increased the AUC value for abnormal signal detection by approximately 47\% and 24\%, respectively, effectively improving the robustness of the network model and reducing the negative impact of adversarial samples on the neural network model. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the residual neural network model based on attention mechanism.},

Aimed at the AI and smart manufacturing's development in large volume and speed, English standard terminology could make international cooperation, information communication and industry standard more effective. There are main difficulties include the multidenoting and the obscurity of words, the rate new jargon, the confusion difference of industry and in language-culture difficulties, particularly language not English.For these challenges, the paper suggests ways: to establish authoritative terminology databases (i.e., ISO/TC 37) that regularly updates their definitions and use for latest version; to intensify collaborations of global and national standard bodies to create one single norm, develop one single standard to define their terminologies usage, to design for the rules of translation to reflect consistent terminologies use, and professionals’ terminology literacy in using terms. Three cases from authors show how those approaches help cross-industry and cross-cultural communications, including use of digital twin to advance the development of aircrafts, automotive, and automobile production in detail.Our research attempt combining linguistics, artificial intelligence, and manufacturing engineering in the presentation of not only theoretical foundations but also practical references for assisting effective international cooperation and normalized development of AI and smart manufacturing.

In a user study, we observed 12 UX design students using the system for both concept ideation and illustration tasks. Our findings identified AI-directed vs. user-directed creative strategies in both tasks and revealed the importance of supporting the interchange between narrative iteration and image generation. We also found effects of the design tasks on their strategies and preferences, providing insights for future development.},

  abstract = {The transfer and promotion of effectively inheritance and innovation of knowledge is a problem that higher education of Chinese medicine must face. This study provides a novel generative AI framework to promote the inheritance and innovative development of knowledge in traditional Chinese medical education. Utilizing multi-modal data processing (textual, visual and experiential) to construct a knowledge base, the model is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformer-based architecture. This context-aware and semantic-rich embedding is made possible using state-of-the-art technology, including attention mechanism and knowledge graph embedding. The learning structure of the model foreshadows the traditional Chinese medicine teaching model and cultivates students as good at in-depth understanding and creative application of knowledge. Furthermore, through transfer learning and domain-specific fine-tuning, the framework attains high fidelity of captured knowledge representation while also supporting the generation of new hypotheses and therapeutics. Our generative AI model improves knowledge transfer accuracy and depth, and encourage innovative thinking compared to traditional educational methodologies, as we demonstrate through experimental results.},

  abstract = {Aiming at the problem of large differences in feature information between different targets in remote sensing images and the complexity of the scene, an improved SwinIR Transformer remote sensing image super-resolution reconstruction algorithm is proposed, combining residual hybrid attention and spatial-gate feed-forward network. First, a new residual hybrid attention module (RHAB) is constructed, which is serially combined with multiple self-attention (MSA) to enhance feature extraction by mixing channel attention (CA), spatial attention (SA), and MSA, and to improve the model's ability in modeling locally and globally relevant information. Second, a spatial-gate feed-forward network (SGFN) is used instead of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) in the original network to effectively reduce redundant channel information, overcome the limitations of the MLP in dealing with local spatial features, and enhance the feature expression efficiency. The experiments use NWPU-RESISC45 and UCMerced_LandUse as the training set, RSOD-Dataset, RSSCN7 Data Set, and WHU-RS19 Data Set as the test set, and the model performance is evaluated by PSNR and SSIM metrics. The experimental results confirm that the model in this paper shows excellent performance in both objective evaluation and subjective visualization.},

This paper attempts to enhance the detection performance of small targets by integrating the bionic perception of brain-inspired intelligence with the data augmentation capabilities of generative models. Firstly, we simulate the multi-scale attention mechanism of the biological visual system using a brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN), enhancing the spatial sensitivity of small target detection. Secondly, we generate high-quality small target samples and optimize local feature representation through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), alleviating data scarcity and feature ambiguity. This paper proposes for the first time a solution providing a cross-modal collaborative framework for small target detection, exploring the potential of combining brain-inspired mechanisms with generative models.},

  abstract = {Reactive synthesis, or simply synthesis, is primarily used to automatically generate control-intensive programs. Applications of reactive synthesis span various domains, including robot motion planning, autonomous system control, and communication protocol development. This paper investigates the reactive synthesis for formulas expressed in Real-Time Linear Dynamic Logic over finite traces (RTLDLf). RTLDLf is more expressive than Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf). While RTLDLf and Linear Dynamic Logic over finite traces (LDLf) share equivalent expressive power, RTLDLf offers greater simplicity in its logical constructs compared to LDLf. Existing synthesis methods for LDLf predominantly rely on automata-based approaches. In this paper, we propose an RTLDLf synthesis method based on temporal testers. We first translate an RTLDLf specification into a temporal tester, a non-deterministic transducer. The tester is then transformed into a graph game between the system and the environment. We finally propose a symbolic algorithm to solve the game to derive a winning strategy for the system player. The proposed method has two advantages: (1) high composability, enabling convenient and efficient synthesis of complex RTLDLf formulas, and (2) symbolic representation of the tester's transition relations and state space, which facilitates the use of efficient symbolic algorithms based on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams.},

  abstract = {Virtual and Extended Reality technologies are increasingly adopted in fields such as healthcare, entertainment, and education. These applications heavily rely on Smart Eye-Wears (SEWs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide users with new ways to perceive their environment. However, SEWs face limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life. Offloading computations to external servers is a prominent example of edge computation. However, this also presents considerable challenges due to delays caused by varying network conditions and server workloads. This paper proposes self-adaptive techniques based on tabular reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the offloading of Deep Neural Network tasks between the SEW, the user’s smartphone, and cloud servers. The goal is to maintain a high-quality user experience while minimizing energy consumption and 5G connection costs. We evaluated our framework under varying 5G and WiFi bandwidths and cloud latency. The results show that Q-learning, SARSA, and Expected SARSA achieve near-optimal policies, with Q-learning demonstrating superior performance in reducing execution time violations (approximately at 10\%) and improving agent stability. Additionally, our approach offers a more favorable trade-off between energy efficiency and execution time violations compared to two baseline methods. Real-system experiments reveal that the proposed solution can double SEW battery life with respect to local computation while maintaining a good quality of service, with only 11\% execution time violations. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our approach in managing resources and enhancing the overall user experience in SEW AI applications.},

Recently, I have been inundated with questions, concerns, and critiques about the rise of augmentation technologies in writing and design processes, particularly generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools that support chat-based text generation and text-to-image production. I'm sure many UX researchers and designers face similar issues in their work. It remains unclear how generative AI should fit into existing workflow or design processes. Common questions include these:• How does AI work? What can it do? Is it free?• Is it cheating if I use AI to produce content?• Who is responsible for the quality of AI-generated content?• To what extent can I outsource my routine work to AI? In other words, what's an acceptable threshold for using AI before it is considered too much?Specific to UX is the value (cost and labor versus gains and effects) of generative AI in the research and design of user-centered products. Students in my UX courses are increasingly worried about the presence of AI and, consequently, the relevance of their developing skill sets in UX. Educators are growing wary about the presence of AI in the context of teaching and learning; many form partially informed decisions on academic policies for AI usage.},

From our experience in CS50, Harvard University's introductory course, we've seen firsthand the impactful role that generative artificial intelligence can play in education. Recognizing its potential and stakes, we integrated OpenAI's GPT into our own teaching methodology. The goal was to emulate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio, incorporating "pedagogical guardrails" to maintain instructional integrity. The result was a personalized, AI-powered bot in the form of a friendly rubber duck aimed at delivering instructional responses and troubleshooting without giving outright solutions. In this tutorial, we share our journey and offer insights into responsibly harnessing AI in educational settings. Participants will gain hands-on experience working with GPT through OpenAI's latest APIs, understanding and crafting prompts, answering questions using embedding-based search, and finally, collaboratively building their own AI chatbot. Ultimately, we'll not only share lessons learned from our own approach but also equip educators hands-on with the knowledge and tools with which they, too, can implement these technologies in their unique teaching environments.},

We identified 57 interactive systems and assigned six roles based on described behavior, tasks, and interactions. While the most prevalent role was task completer, some AI systems also served their team as problem solvers, evaluators, task motivators, or even teamwork support and team leaders. We contribute (1) a classification system for team roles, behaviors, tasks, and interactions of AI team members and (2) an overview of AI systems’ team roles in anesthesiology. We conclude that (3) AI systems’ intended social roles within teams need to be more consciously reflected, shaped and clearly communicated to meet healthcare standards.},

The proposed methodology for the technological model integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and GPT technologies, allowing the loading of documents in different formats, such as PDF and Markdown documents, which are then analyzed using the aforementioned technologies to respond to customer requests precisely, enabling a more personalized and efficient interaction. For testing the technological model, a prototype was designed, from which the level of satisfaction of a sample of 50 customers was evaluated after interacting with the application and the traditional method. As a result, it was observed that customers experienced a satisfaction level of 59.4\% when served traditionally, while with the technological model interaction, they recorded an average satisfaction of 92.6\%. Therefore, the research concludes that the proposed technological model represents an opportunity to efficiently address customer service requests, providing a more effective and satisfactory service, which also implies the optimization of resources and costs for an organization.},

  abstract = {As computers increasingly make decisions about who gets a loan, a job, or even bail, the expansion of AI algorithms has provoked public concern about ethical issues, and the need to understand what constitutes AI algorithms and how they make decisions becomes ever more pressing. For example, an increasing number of high-profile news reports that widely-used algorithms have unfairly discriminated against some groups of people (e.g., by gender and race) in parole decisions and other major life events. Focusing more attention on ethical bias in learning algorithms is key to unlocking the potential of automated decision systems while ensuring fairness and accountability so that everyone can advance equally in society. Ethical AI has become increasingly important and it has been attracting attention from academia and industry, due to its increased popularity in real-world applications with fairness concerns. It also places fundamental importance on ethical considerations in determining legitimate and illegitimate uses of AI. Organizations that apply ethical AI have clearly stated well-defined review processes to ensure adherence to legal guidelines. Therefore, the wave of research at the intersection of ethical AI in data mining and machine learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and social science.},

  abstract = {In recent years, mental health issues among college students have been on the rise, with frequent concerns such as anxiety, depression, and heightened stress. As a result, there is an increasing interest in and demand for psychological guidance and counseling. Issues related to mental wellness are particularly common during adolescence and are beginning to affect younger demographics more frequently. Among individuals aged 18-24, the risk of depression has been detected at a rate of 24.1\%. The college years represent a crucial phase in student development, characterized by academic demands, social hurdles, and shifts in self-awareness, all of which can significantly influence mental well-being. As such, it is becoming ever more crucial for colleges to prioritize the prevention of mental health challenges among their students and to offer counseling and therapeutic services. This paper delves into the significance of psychological counseling alongside the foundational concepts of artificial intelligence. By analyzing data from a sample of 566 college students, it utilizes t-tests and chi-square analyses to investigate the current implementation of AI in psychological counseling. Utilizing machine learning techniques in conjunction with predictive models powered by big data and AI algorithms, the study organizes and processes fundamental student information. Chi-square analyses are employed to explore the links between different mental health dimensions and personal characteristics, providing colleges with insights for assessing and supporting students' mental well-being.},

By comparing machine-generated scores with human scores and implementing a designed screening strategy, we ultimately identified samples that require re-evaluation by expert graders for final scoring. This method only requires a small amount of human scoring to train the model. Experiments on real data demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively identifies responses that need re-evaluation, thereby improving the overall grading quality.},

  abstract = {Project Based Learning (PBL) is a constructivist educational method. It addresses real-world problems and drives the learning process through collaborative exploration and iterative thinking among students. It shifts the educational goal from rote memorization of knowledge to the generation and development of abilities. However, PBL still faces many challenges in teaching implementation, mainly including three aspects: personalized project design, dynamic process guidance, and refined evaluation feedback. With the acceleration of digital transformation in education and the development of Large Scale Models technology, applying Generative AI to PBL will provide assistance for its effective implementation. Generative AI can assist in optimizing teaching project design, support personalized exploration processes for students, and achieve multi-dimensional ability assessment of students. At present, the application of Generative AI in PBL is in the exploratory stage. This article deconstructs the application of Generative AI in project design, implementation, and evaluation. Then, taking the exchange network construction teaching project as an example, it proposes the prompt language design of Generative AI in PBL teaching project design. Finally, it analyzes the potential risks brought by Generative AI. This study provides an implementation model and example for intelligent innovation in PBL.},

However, during the training process, models may memorize sensitive private data, posing risks to data security and privacy protection. Member Inference Attacks (MIA) aim to determine whether a specific record was used in the training of the target model. This approach is crucial for detecting privacy risks in models and has seen substantial progress in both traditional and fine-tuned models. However, this remains an unresolved issue for large language models (LLMs). Recent studies indicate that under proper experimental setups, the AUC-ROC of existing methods approaches 0.5 (random guessing). Subsequently, some research has shifted MIA to dataset inference, achieving promising results in this area. Our study shows that when fine-tuning a target model with aggregated samples, it is possible to distinguish whether these samples were used in training the target model by observing the initial loss returned by the model. Based on this observation, we propose a fine-tuning-based member inference method for large language models. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive experiments on three mainstream models and seven datasets. The results indicate that member inference attacks with aggregated samples can achieve acceptable outcomes.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development and widespread application of artificial intelligence technologies, the global employment landscape is undergoing profound changes. The demand for low-skilled jobs is decreasing, while the demand for high-skilled jobs is increasing. This study selects labour market data for major economies from 2015 to 2024, and applies regression and cluster analysis to explore the intrinsic link between the degree of technology penetration and labour restructuring.The study finds that AI technologies have replaced around a quarter of low-skilled jobs in manufacturing, while at the same time high-skilled jobs such as data science and AI development have grown rapidly, further widening the skills gap. Moreover, the impact has varied significantly across countries and industries. Developed countries have experienced a massive loss of low-skill jobs and a dramatic increase in high-skill jobs, while developing countries have experienced similar trends, but with relatively smaller changes.Based on the above findings, the study makes a series of targeted policy recommendations, including strengthening vocational training, promoting industrial upgrading, improving the social security system, and enhancing the adaptability of the labour force, with the aim of mitigating the impact of AI on the employment structure and promoting the smooth development of the labour market.},

  abstract = {When graduates of computing degree programs enter the software industry, they will most likely join teams working on legacy code bases developed by people other than themselves. In these so-called brownfield software development settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences undergraduate students’ programming performance, behaviors, and understanding when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10 undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 34.9\% faster (p &lt; 0.05) and made 50.0\% more solution progress (p &lt; 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover, our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 10.6\% less time manually writing code (p &lt; 0.05), and 11.6\% less time conducting web searches (p &lt; 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that leverage GenAI assistants’ benefits while fostering reflection on how and why GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks. Complete study results and analysis are presented at ghcopilot-icer.github.io.},

  abstract = {In factories, fans is an important part in production. However, how to ensure the safe and stable operation of it is always a difficult problem. In order to solve this problem, this study presents a fan anomaly detection method based on an improved CBAM attention mechanism using the MobileNetV3-Small model. In this model, the conventional SE module is replaced with an optimized CBAM, which uses dilated convolutions to enhance the model's sensitivity to anomalous sounds. At the same time, the model incorporates CutMix and Focal Loss as the loss function, further improving the model's robustness to imbalanced data. Additionally, to strengthen the nonlinear representation capacity of the architecture, we implement CELU activation functions as substitutes for conventional ReLU units within residual modules. According to experimental results, we can find that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 97\% in a -6dB noise environment, which is an improvement of 1.07 percentage points over the original MobileNetV3 model, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in fan anomaly detection.},

  abstract = {Software engineering has been a crucial discipline to support the advancement of our modern world, since software systems power all segments of society. This is possible due to the development of the discipline in the last decades, to a state in which we have qualified people (software engineers, practitioners, and researchers), proper processes, and cutting-edge technologies. To achieve this current state, the discipline of software engineering has been advanced by private companies, open-source communities, government agencies, and universities. What do all those different institutions have in common? They have talented, smart, and creative people. The doctoral degree is the highest academic degree, focusing on educating and preparing talented, smart, and creative people. While the discipline of software engineering has seen great development, the new demands from society and the emergence of new technologies (e.g., generative artificial intelligence, quantum computing, Internet of Things) create new challenges and uncover old ones. In this context, the current generation of doctoral students will be in charge of taming such new technologies to meet the demands for the benefit of humanity. Given this crucial role of doctoral students in the future of software engineering, we need to discuss what the expectations, responsibilities, benefits, and barriers are faced by a doctoral student. In this talk, I share my experiences as a software developer, doctoral student, post-doc researcher, and professor directly working with software engineering in the past 20 years. This talk aims to inspire and guide students as they navigate the complexities and milestones of their doctoral studies. The topics of talk involve collaboration with your pairs, publication of your work results, understanding your community (e.g., researchers and practitioners working on the domain of variability and systematic reuse), what students should do and what they should not do, and some provocative discussion to motivate critical thinking by the audience. After the talk, the students will be equipped with practical suggestions and advice so that they can avoid pitfalls, recognize good opportunities to grow, and plan their future careers.},

In this study, we applied AIGC in the teaching practice related to higher-order thinking, and conducted both qualitative and quantitative analyses on the field verification and review depth of 240 students through investigations. The results show that AIGC can effectively enhance students' HOTS. Specifically, males show a greater preference for field verification, while females demonstrate a higher level of review depth. However, it is also found that over-reliance on AIGC may weaken HOTS. These results offer practical and theoretical support for teaching according to students' aptitude and effectively promote the deep integration and reform of artificial intelligence with design teaching.

  abstract = {The application of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the strategic decision-making patterns of enterprises. To clarify the influence mechanism of AI on corporate strategic decision-making, to elucidate the mechanisms through which AI influences corporate strategic decision-making, this study uses Chinese A-share listed companies from 2013 to 2023 as a sample to empirically examine the impact of AI on strategic decision-making. The research finds that AI application significantly increases the overall strategic deviance of enterprises, supporting the "differentiation effect" hypothesis. Sub-dimensional tests show that AI drives enterprises to significantly deviate from industry norms in advertising investment, R&amp;D intensity, and fixed asset renewal, demonstrating characteristics of "active innovation"; while in the dimensions of capital intensity and financial leverage, enterprises tend to approach industry averages, reflecting a "rational contraction" tendency. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the strategic value of AI and offers practical insights for enterprises to optimize their technology application paths.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has attained human-level performance in tasks like text summarization, machine translation, and code generation while handling multimodal data. Despite these advances, AI poses challenges such as generating false or biased outputs, causing discrimination, and exhibiting opaque decision-making processes that hinder bias mitigation. Additionally, training large language models (LLMs) for AI consumes substantial energy and can enable autonomous warfare, posing a threat to eco-justice, and raising sustainability concerns. Their ability to create realistic content poses the risk of misuse and perpetuating misinformation. This article addresses these ethical issues and presents solutions through regulation and technology, with examples of global legislation tackling algorithmic discrimination and consumer rights. It emphasizes the need for a workforce skilled in navigating an AI-driven world. Future research directions touch upon mechanistic interpretability to understand AI outputs, new approaches to natural language processing and multimodal data understanding, and developing more interpretable neural network architectures with fewer parameters.

With participation from 248 students and 21 faculty, the study employed surveys and focus group discussions to capture participants' perceptions on AI, how AI is currently integrated into teaching, learning and assessment, and the impact of AI on these activities. The results show that both students and faculty perceive that AI is transforming higher education, and faculty are exploring AI integration in their work. However, many faculty have concerns about the negative effects of students' use of generative AI and continue to educate them on responsible use of AI for learning. Such concerns influence how faculty assess student learning reverting to in-person assessments among other strategies. Overall, the consensus is that AI is transforming higher education, and there is a need for institutions, faculty and students to adapt to this reality.},

Understanding how PR students view and respond to this technological shift is becoming necessary to education and career choice. This study examined how Chinese PR students' perceptions of AI affect their career choices in PR through the lens of social cognitive career theory (SCCT). The study investigated the relationships between AI self-efficacy, outcome expectation of AI, interest in AI, AI contextual support and barrier, and PR career choice. Using an online questionnaire, the researcher collected data from 444 PR students at a Chinese university. SPSS was used to analyze the data, and reliability analysis, exploratory factor analysis, correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis were conducted to test the hypothesized relationships among the variables. The regression results indicated that AI self-efficacy, outcome expectation of AI, interest in AI, and AI contextual support positively influenced students' intention to pursue a career in PR. AI contextual barrier showed a significant negative impact on PR career choice. This study contributes to understanding how emerging technologies affect career decisions in PR education and has important implications for curriculum development and career guidance. It suggests that PR educators should focus on developing students' AI competencies while fostering their professional interests and that institutions should provide adequate support systems for AI learning. In addition, the findings provide valuable insights for PR programs that prepare students for an AI-enhanced industry.},

However, the impact of chatbot-assisted learning on higher-order thinking skills is not yet known. In this study, a chatbot named C4D Helper was developed by using Coze, a chatbot creation platform in China like Google's Dialogflow. A chatbot-assisted learning model was designed based on the Design Thinking framework to cultivate students' higher-order thinking skills. In order to examine the effectiveness of this model, a pre-posttest quasi-experiment lasting for 5 weeks was conducted. The students in two classes, majoring in Digital Media Technology at Kashi University, were randomly assigned to control group(CG, n=31) and experimental group (EG, n=31). Students in CG learned by traditional teaching model while students in EG learned by chatbot-assisted learning model. The results showed that the chatbot-assisted learning model can significantly improve higher-order thinking skills, including problem-solving skills, critical thinking, creative thinking, and cooperation skills.},

It examines two different subsidy strategies and creates an evolutionary game model of AI medical technology diffusion in the context of a Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) network. The two subsidy strategies are analyzed in detail, factoring in the maturity of the technology, the initial proportion of firms, and the initial proportion of hospitals. The study finds that: 1) Government subsidies fixed in advance negatively affect technology diffusion when the maturity of the technology is uncertain. 2) Increased proportion of high-share hospitals increased the spread of AI technology because the enhanced market share benefits the firms using AI technology which causes them to attract other firms to copy that strategy. 3) From the perspective of the uncertainty of effectiveness, the adaptive subsidies perform better than fixed subsidies across all scenarios. 4) A higher initial proportion of hospitals using AI results in greater spreads of AI technology. The governments are recommended to use adaptive subsidies and to focus support on hospitals in order to reduce the barriers to entry. The government should also provide infrastructure and establish more higher-level hospitals to allow for the more effective use of resources.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, problems such as fragmentation of learning content and unequal distribution of resources as well as difficulties in evaluating the learning effects emerge for open learning. This paper proposes hybrid learning through AI-based intelligent recommendation and adaptive learning techniques as a solution. Statistics from the students' learning history and behavioural data are used with deep learning for the prediction of students' learning needs accurate enough to recommend personalised resources. Students' progress in understanding is checked through natural language processing before further personalisation. The complexity of the learning content then changes dynamically in accordance to every individual. The tasks of collecting data, training the proposed model, optimising its algorithm, and validating the experiments therein are undertaken. The experiments find that the performance of student learning using the hybrid model improved by 9.3\%, reduced learning time by 15.5\%, and improved finding the right recommendation by about 23.8\% compared to the non-intelligent platform. In conclusion, the study proves that Ai and open learning, in practice, can increase the efficiency of learning and enhance the learning experience, providing a way to bridge the equity in education with personalised education.},

China's Henan Province is used as a case study to examine the contemporary expression and application of traditional cultural elements in cultural creative product design. The study reports the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autocoders (VAE) in artistic style extraction from a large number of datasets and generating innovative images with regional cultural features. The study draws from cultural anthropology's "Three Elements of Culture Theory" in examining the material, organizational and spiritual dimensions. The study identifies three methods of cultural translation: direct translation, consecutive translation, and indirect translation.

  abstract = {Purpose–The purpose of this paper is to examine how social media influencers' adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to create posts content disclosure affects their followers' responses.Design/methodology/approach–In this paper, two experiments were designed to fit the real situation. The variable scales involved in the experiments were mature scales, and ANOVA and the process in SPSS were used for testing.Findings–Study 1 indicates that followers react negatively to influencers' adoption of GenAI for social media production, which is mitigated when influencers engage in honesty-based motive explanation disclosure. Study 2 reveals that influencer motive attribution and perceived influencers' authenticity play chain-mediated roles in the effects of GenAI's adoption of disclosure type on followers' attitudes and behaviors.Originality/value–First, this study extends the GenAI marketing literature, which is still in its infancy, to provide a novel idea and framework for studying social media content creation by GenAI. Second, this study draws on the literature in the field of sponsored disclosure to further demonstrate the potential effectiveness of similar motive explanation for this approach.},

  abstract = {In the face of the high requirements of vocational education for practical skills training, as well as the poor results and high costs of traditional training, this study aims to build an efficient and intelligent virtual training and simulation operation platform by introducing generative artificial intelligence technology to improve teaching quality and learning efficiency. This paper uses the adversarial generation ability of GAN and combines it with the knowledge graph in the field of vocational education to generate a high-fidelity and scalable virtual training environment. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to dynamically adjust the scene parameters to adapt to the needs of different majors and skill levels. Based on the Transformer multimodal dialogue model, a real-time operation guidance system integrating virtual and real is constructed. The physical engine is combined to simulate the feedback of equipment operation, and the long short-term memory network (LSTM) is used to capture the characteristics of the trainee's operation sequence, dynamically predict potential errors and trigger correction prompts. This paper also uses the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to build a personalized evaluation agent, using the trainee's operation data as the state space to generate targeted training suggestions. The average operation accuracy of the experimental group students reaches 89.715\%, the highest skill assessment pass rate reaches 100\%, and the overall distribution is more concentrated, reducing the cost of practical training. In addition, teachers and students highly evaluated the teaching adaptability, operation guidance and error correction functions of the platform. The teaching platform proposed in this study provides a new path and strategy for the modernization of vocational education.},

In order to improve the prediction accuracy and model adaptability, this paper proposes a labor demand prediction model based on generative adversarial deep learning (GADL) and multi-modal data fusion. The model uses generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate supplementary data to compensate for data scarcity, combined with convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer to conduct multimodal feature extraction, and finally time series modeling by long and short-term memory network (LSTM). The experimental results show that the GADL model is better than the LSTM and ARIMA method in several key performance indicators, and the mean square error (MSE) is reduced to 5\% of the traditional method, and the determination coefficient (R²) reaches 0.9966, which significantly improves the prediction accuracy. The research shows that GADL model can more effectively capture the changing trend of labor market and provide data support for the optimization of government employment policy, enterprise human resource planning and talent training in universities. The study in this paper provides a new methodology for labor market prediction and lays the foundation for subsequent research.},

The results show that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm all have a significant positive impact on behavior intention of dishonesty when online learning. Specifically, the attitude of dishonest behaviors in online learning is influenced by autonomous motivation (e.g., intrinsic interest, self-improvement) and controlled motivation (e.g., external rewards, avoidance of punishments); perceived behavioral control is influenced by autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and moral obligation; and the subjective norm is not only affected by autonomous motivation but also by moral obligation. Based on this, this study proposes some interventions to mitigate dishonest behaviors in online learning to create a good learning atmosphere for the online learning environment.},

AI is developing fast, with a large number of applications shown, such as polishing the statement. The rapid development of AI has allowed its integration into various sectors, including 3D printing. While the applications of AI in many industrial systems have been identified by existing studies, the applications of this emerging technology in another promising technology – 3D printing – have been largely unexplored. This points out the necessity of conducting researches on this issue to facilitate the further development of both AI and 3D printing technologies. This study examines the application of AI across different phases of 3D printing, such as design, usage, production, and maintenance. AI enhances the efficiency of 3D printing by providing generative design alternatives, automating parameter settings, optimizing process controls, and improving product quality through real-time monitoring. AI's ability to store and analyze vast amounts of data enables better decision-making, predictive maintenance, and customized production, reducing costs and enhancing production capabilities. However, AI implementation in 3D printing also faces challenges, including system complexity, data privacy concerns, and the need for extensive sensor networks. As AI technologies continue to evolve, they promise further advancements in flexibility, precision, and cost-efficiency, potentially revolutionizing the 3D printing industry. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of AI's applications in 3D printing, offering insights into how AI can drive future innovation in additive manufacturing.},

The permanence of fingerprints means security breaches can have lasting impacts. Traditionally, organizations store only fingerprint templates to mitigate the risks associated with stolen fingerprint images. However, advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly deepfake technologies, now enable adversaries to generate fingerprints from stolen templates, increasing the threat of data breaches.In this paper, we demonstrate and validate a previously theorized threat by evaluating an end-to-end attack in the physical world. Our approach involves: (1) generating fingerprint images from unseen templates, (2) fabricating silicone replicas of these deepfake fingerprints using a 3D resin printer, and (3) successfully deceiving fingerprint scanners with the replicas. The entire lab setup cost only $440 USD and only 7 cents to replicate each fingerprint thereafter, highlighting the attack's practicality.To support reproducibility and encourage the development of defenses, we publicly release our deepfake fingerprint pipeline.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the students' perceptions of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in upper-secondary mathematics education. Data was collected from Finnish high school students to represent how key constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model—Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Enjoyment, and Intention to Use—influence the adoption of AI tools. First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how AI tools can be integrated into mathematics education and highlights key differences between the Finnish educational context and previous studies based on structural equation modeling.},

In this paper a practice where an existing assessment is presented with the addition that students are not prevented from using Generative Artificial Intelligence but must declare and explain such use. These declarations and explanations are considered to better understand how students approached the assessment and how it could be refined in future.},

This paper proposes a different view: prompts function as cognitive interfaces that mediate between user intent and algorithmic generation. Integrating theories of external cognition, interface semiotics, and pragmatist theories of situated inquiry, the paper provides a theoretical framing of prompting along three interrelated dimensions: semantic projection, compositional structuring, and interpretive negotiation. Through an empirical vignette from branding communication, I show how prompting can be seen as a dynamic representational activity, deeply embedded in cognitive processes of exploration, articulation, and iterative refinement. By reframing the prompt as a site of cognitive labor rather than as a static interface, this expands our understanding of interaction with generative AI as epistemic, semiotic, and situated.},

Aiming at the problems of traditional algorithms in UAV path planning, such as local optima trapping and low convergence accuracy, this hybrid algorithm combines the advantages of both algorithms. The Fuch and Logistic chaotic maps are used for population initialization to enhance the global search ability. During the optimization process, the DBO algorithm's strong local exploitation ability and the GWO algorithm's global search characteristics are coordinated. A B\'{e}zier curve is employed to smooth the planned path. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid algorithm outperforms traditional algorithms in terms of path length, convergence speed, and path smoothness, validating its effectiveness in UAV three-dimensional path planning.},

  abstract = {From the innovation, Artificial Intelligence (AI) materialized as one of the noticeable research areas in various technologies and has almost expanded into every aspect of modern human life. However, nowadays, the development of AI is unpredictable with the stated values of those developing them; hence, the risk of misbehaving AI increases continuously. Therefore, there are uncertainties about endorsing that the development and deploying of AI are favorable and not unfavorable to humankind. In addition, AI holds a black-box pattern, which results in a lack of understanding of how systems can work based on the raised concerns. From the above discussion, trustworthy AI is vital for the extensive adoption of AI in many applications, with strong attention to humankind and the need to focus on AI systems developing into the system outline at the time of system design. In this survey, we discuss compound materials on trustworthy AI and the present state-of-the-art of trustworthy AI technologies, revealing new perspectives, bridging knowledge gaps, and paving the way for potential advances of robustness, and explainability rules which play a proactive role in designing AI systems. Systems that are reliable and secure and mimic human behavior significantly impact the technological AI ecosystem. We provide various contemporary technologies to build explainability and robustness for AI-based solutions, so AI works in a safer and more trustworthy manner. Finally, we conclude our survey article with high-end opportunities, challenges, and future research directions for trustworthy AI to investigate in the future.},

This  research is contributing to this development by exploring how a recommendation for the domain of Business Informatics in German speaking countries can be improved by formalizing the recommendations in a semantic model that relies on sophisticated European ontologies in the domain like the European Learning Model (ELM) and related data models. It employs Generative Artificial Intelligence Systems to create semantic models in an experimental way and evaluates the resulting model quality. The results show that a formalization using GenAI has a high potential, but currently also shows deficits in the correctness of the resulting models, requiring human oversight during the model creation.},

  abstract = {Formal communications such as public calls, announcements, or regulations are supposed to exhibit respect for diversity in terms of gender, race, age, and disability. However, human writers often lack adequate inclusive writing skills. For instance, they tend to overuse the masculine as a neutral form, mainly because they are self-trained on biased text examples. To overcome this issue, we propose to leverage Generative Artificial Intelligence to support inclusive language writing. Focusing on formal Italian communications, we have designed and developed an AI-assisted tool for non-inclusive text detection and reformulation. Thanks to the joint work with a team of linguistic experts, we first define a set of linguistic criteria necessary to model inclusive writing forms in Italian. Based on these criteria, we collect and annotate a dataset of Italian administrative documents enriched with fine-grained inclusive annotations. Finally, we train deep learning models on the collected data for non-inclusive language detection and inclusive language reformulation tasks. We perform quantitative and human-driven evaluations on the trained models. The best detection model correctly classifies 89\% of the sentences, whereas the best reformulation model produces 73\% fully correct reformulations. Both models have been integrated into a writing assistance tool acting as a text proofreader and self-learning tool for non-expert writers, namely Inclusively. Once a non-inclusive piece of text is detected, the proposed approach suggests inclusive reformulations. The tool also provides explanations of the models’ outputs to increase system transparency. Furthermore, it allows expert end-users to provide further annotations for system fine-tuning. The trained models and the writing assistance tool are publicly available for research purposes.},

  abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) represent a significant share of global resource usage. Notably, the energy consumption of data centres has emerged as a critical concern, escalating rapidly, especially with the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. This surge in energy demand calls for efforts focused on measuring and reducing the energy and carbon footprints of components used in ICT service delivery. However, the variety and multitude of devices involved in these services make it challenging to accurately measure and evaluate these footprints.In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to assess energy impacts by considering data centres for what they are: throughput computing systems offering ICT services. We define a simple experimental testbed and evaluate several machines with different hardware capacities. These machines serve two ICT services: a loop incrementing a counter until a defined limit, and an AI inference predicting the next token based on an input.Our experiment highlights three main take-aways: (a) the CPU usage is a poor predictor of the power consumption, (b) the energy or CO2 quantity associated with a service visit highly depends on the total load the service is facing, and (c) modern machines do not yield better energy figures compared to older ones in all circumstances.},

In this study, we submit a new transformed layer inside the VCS framework using cyclic boundary shifts over the text images. A new module, Transformed Variational Color Shift (TVCS) is proposed. This method integrates a generalized set of colors (the original dataset) in a manner that can transform the input dataset. The experimental results show that TVCS has superior recognition accuracy than VCS and has better robustness against interference. The algorithm proposed is innovative as the data augmentation of text images, especially in a noisy environment.},

  abstract = {Multimodal MRI synthesis is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, particularly in glioma segmentation. However, cross-subject synthesis faces significant challenges due to the variability in brain structures and tumor morphology across individuals. Existing methods often fail to preserve tumor region fidelity, limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose the Tumor Representation Consistency Alignment Generative Adversarial Network (TRCA-GAN), a novel framework designed to enhance tumor region fidelity in cross-subject multimodal MRI synthesis. TRCA-GAN introduces two key innovations: the Region-Aware Perturbation Module (RAPM), which enhances tumor structure preservation through adaptive perturbation and joint attention mechanisms, and the Local Contrast Discriminator Module (LCDM), which improves tumor contrast fidelity via a dual physical-feature constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2021 dataset demonstrate that TRCA-GAN significantly outperforms comparison methods in terms of image generation quality and tumor segmentation accuracy. The results highlight the effectiveness of TRCA-GAN in addressing the challenges of cross-subject MRI synthesis, making it a powerful tool for clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Regular network traffic prediction techniques, which generally rely on data normalization, often fail to account for the non-stable characteristics of network traffic, leading to a decline in estimate reliability. A novel approach to this problem is the Trend Decomposition Enhanced Large Language Model for Non-Static Network Traffic Prediction (TD-LLM). Applying trend decomposition as the preparation approach, the proposed strategy first divides raw information into resolved and non-fixed parts. The predetermined portion is standardized and processed, implementing a multi-head cross-attention mechanism, while a better self-attention mechanism improves the non-stationary element. Prompt engineering is used to create specially designed causes that serve as a guideline for the design throughout the forecast process. Finally, the processed data and creates are integrated into the large language model to produce the predicted results. In contrast to foundation models like Time- LLM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer, the TD-LLM type drastically reduces mean squared error for network traffic prediction across many regions, according to exploratory evaluations, with decreases of 19.73 \%, 54.71 \%, 76.88 \%, and 61.48 \%, respectively.},

However, deploying conversational agents is challenging and can easily have adverse effects. To this end, more conceptual clarity on how to design for, for example, trust, in conversational agents is needed. Ideally, using theories could provide conceptual clarity and guide and ground conversational agents designed for trust. We conducted a scoping review on how systematically trust is being designed for in conversational agents. The review shows that although the conversational agent work is well grounded, the variation in referential theories used, manipulations chosen, and measures used is high. Moreover, the relation between these dimensions is not always explicitly explained. This hinders the abstraction of more generalizable research findings. We conclude with the suggestion for the development of more intermediate levels of knowledge in the context of designing for trust in conversational agents.},

  abstract = {In computer-based learning environments (CBLEs), adopting effective self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies requires sophisticated coordination of multiple SRL processes. While various studies have proposed adaptive SRL scaffolds (i.e. real-time advice on adopting effective SRL processes) and embedded them in CBLEs to facilitate learners’ effective use of SRL strategies, two key research gaps remain. First, there is a lack of research on SRL scaffolds that are based on continuous assessment of both learners’ SRL processes and learning conditions (e.g., awareness of learning resources) to provide adaptive support. Second, current analytics-based scaffolding mechanisms lack the scalability needed to effectively address multiple learning conditions. Integration of analytics of SRL with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can provide scalable scaffolding for real-time SRL processes and evolving conditions. Yet, empirical studies implementing and evaluating effects of this integration remain scarce. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized control trial, assigning participants to three groups (control, process only, and process with condition groups) to investigate the effects of using GenAI to turn insights from real-time analytics about students’ SRL processes and conditions into adaptive scaffolds. The results demonstrate that integrating real-time analytics with GenAI in adaptive SRL scaffolds – addressing both SRL processes and dynamic conditions – promotes more metacognitive learning patterns compared to the control and process-only groups. In addition, the learners showed varying levels of compliance with analytics-based GenAI scaffolds, and this was also reflected in how the learners coordinated their SRL processes, particularly in the performance phase of SRL. This study contributes to the literature by designing, implementing, and evaluating the impact of adaptive scaffolds on learners’ SRL processes using real-time analytics with GenAI.},

  abstract = {Typeface design plays a vital role in graphic and communication design. Different typefaces are suitable for different contexts and can convey different emotions and messages. Typeface design still relies on skilled designers to create unique styles for specific needs. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been applied to typeface generation, but these methods face challenges due to the high annotation requirements of typeface generation datasets, which are difficult to obtain. Furthermore, machine-generated typefaces often fail to meet designers’ specific requirements, as dataset annotations limit the diversity of the generated typefaces. In response to these limitations in current typeface generation models, we propose an alternative approach to the task. Instead of relying on dataset-provided annotations to define the typeface style vector, we introduce a transformer-based language model to learn the mapping between a typeface style description and the corresponding style vector. We evaluated the proposed model using both existing and newly created style descriptions. Results indicate that the model can generate high-quality, patent-free typefaces based on the input style descriptions provided by designers.

Computer science student perceptions and behaviors towards GenAI tools have been studied, but the effects of such tools on student learning have yet to be determined conclusively. We investigate the impact of GenAI tools on computing students' performance in a database course and aim to understand why students use GenAI tools in assignments. Our mixed-methods study (N=226) asked students to self-report whether they used a GenAI tool to complete a part of an assignment and why. Our results reveal that students utilizing GenAI tools performed better on the assignment part in which LLMs were permitted but did worse in other parts of the assignment and in the course overall. Also, those who did not use GenAI tools viewed more discussion board posts and participated more than those who used ChatGPT. This suggests that using GenAI tools may not lead to better skill development or mental models, at least not if the use of such tools is unsupervised, and that engagement with official course help supports may be affected. Further, our thematic analysis of reasons for using or not using GenAI tools, helps understand why students are drawn to these tools. Shedding light into such aspects empowers instructors to be proactive in how to encourage, supervise, and handle the use or integration of GenAI into courses, fostering good learning habits.},

While there is considerable demand for XAI, there remains a scarcity of studies aimed at comprehensively understanding the practical distinctions among different methods and effectively aligning each method with users’ individual needs, and ideally, offer a mapping function which can map each user with its specific needs to a method of explainability. This study endeavors to bridge this gap by conducting a review of the relevant works in XAI, with a specific focus on Explainable Machine Learning (XML), and a keen eye on user needs to provide an observational study. Our main objective is to offer a classification of XAI methods within the realm of XML, categorizing current works into three distinct domains: philosophy, theory, and practice. Moreover, our study seeks to facilitate the connection between XAI users and the most suitable methods for them and tailor explanations to meet their specific needs by proposing a mapping function that take to account users and their desired properties and suggest an XAI method to them. This entails an examination of prevalent XAI approaches and an evaluation of their properties. The primary outcome of this study is the formulation of a clear and concise strategy for selecting the optimal XAI method to achieve a given goal, all while delivering personalized explanations tailored to individual users.},

  abstract = {Underwater optical object detection (UOD), aiming at identifying and localising objects in underwater optical images or videos, presents significant challenges due to the optical distortion, water turbidity, and changing illumination in underwater scenes. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) based methods, especially deep learning methods, have shown promising performance in UOD. To further facilitate future advancements, we comprehensively study AI-based UOD. In this survey, we first categorise existing algorithms into traditional machine learning-based methods and deep learning-based methods, and summarise them by considering learning strategies, experimental datasets, learning stages, employed features or techniques, and underlying frameworks. Next, we discuss the potential challenges and suggest possible solutions and new directions. We also perform both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of mainstream algorithms across multiple benchmark datasets, taking into account the diversity and biases in experimental setups. Finally, we introduce two off-the-shelf detection analysis tools, Diagnosis and TIDE, which will examine the effects of object characteristics and various types of errors on detector performance. These tools help identify the strengths and weaknesses of different detectors, providing insights for further improvement. The source code, trained models, utilised datasets, detection results, and detection analysis tools are publicly available at  and will be regularly updated.},

  abstract = {The metaverse presents an emerging creative expression and collaboration frontier where generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can play a pivotal role with its ability to generate multimodal content from simple prompts. These prompts allow the metaverse to interact with GenAI, where context information, instructions, input data, or even output indications constituting the prompt can come from within the metaverse. However, their integration poses challenges regarding interoperability, lack of standards, scalability, and maintaining a high-quality user experience. This article explores how GenAI can productively assist in enhancing creativity within the contexts of the metaverse and unlock new opportunities. We provide a technical, in-depth overview of the different generative models for image, video, audio, and 3D content within the metaverse environments. We also explore the bottlenecks, opportunities, and innovative applications of GenAI from the perspectives of end users, developers, service providers, and AI researchers. This survey commences by highlighting the potential of GenAI for enhancing the metaverse experience through dynamic content generation to populate massive virtual worlds. Subsequently, we shed light on the ongoing research practices and trends in multimodal content generation, enhancing realism and creativity and alleviating bottlenecks related to standardization, computational cost, privacy, and safety. Last, we share insights into promising research directions toward the integration of GenAI with the metaverse for creative enhancement, improved immersion, and innovative interactive applications.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers new possibilities for generating personalized programming exercises, addressing the need for individual practice. However, the task quality along with the student perspective on such generated tasks remains largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper introduces and evaluates a new feature of the so-called Tutor Kai for generating comprehensive programming tasks, including problem descriptions, code skeletons, unit tests, and model solutions. The presented system allows students to freely choose programming concepts and contextual themes for their tasks. To evaluate the system, we conducted a two-phase mixed-methods study comprising (1) an expert rating of 200 automatically generated programming tasks w.r.t. task quality, and (2) a study with 26 computer science students who solved and rated the personalized programming tasks. Results show that experts classified 89.5\% of the generated tasks as functional and 92.5\% as solvable. However, the system's rate for implementing all requested programming concepts decreased from 94\% for single-concept tasks to 40\% for tasks addressing three concepts. The student evaluation further revealed high satisfaction with the personalization. Students also reported perceived benefits for learning. The results imply that the new feature has the potential to offer students individual tasks aligned with their context and need for exercise. Tool developers, educators, and, above all, students can benefit from these insights and the system itself.},

  abstract = {Traditional homography estimation uses methods such as SIFT and ORB in feature extraction but suffers from problems such as feature sparsity in large baseline scenes with large viewing angles and low overlap, causing inaccurate homography estimation. This paper proposes an unsupervised method that combines edge detection and feature fusion to solve the above problems. Firstly, three layers of image features are extracted by the feature pyramid; secondly, the edge detection module extracts the edge features of the input image and feature map; then, the features are fused by adaptive feature fusion and attentional feature fusion; finally, correlation is computed layer-by-layer using the fused features to estimate the homography. In this paper, experiments have been conducted to verify the method's effectiveness by calculating the PSNR and SSIM metrics. Experimental results show that this method can estimate homography more accurately than other related methods when stitching large baseline images.},

  abstract = {Most of the attention on GenAI in computing education has focused on programming-centric tasks, such as code generation, giving feedback on code, or providing synthetic programming partners. Yet in advanced software engineering and project courses, interpersonal skills such as team meetings or customer interviews are equally important but difficult and instructor-intensive to teach realistically. GenAI presents the possibility of scaffolding the teaching of some of these practices by enabling exercises in which students develop the ability to investigate a topic by iteratively asking questions to find a solution. The goal is to create scenarios in which students train to interact with humans in real-world situations, simulating these interactions in a controlled, guided environment. These simulations could help students practice and refine ''soft skills,'' such as teamwork and interviewing, by mimicking the types of exchanges and problem-solving they would encounter in professional environments. This approach allows learners to engage in realistic communication exercises, improving their ability to handle complex, interpersonal tasks through repeated practice with AI-guided feedback. As an example, we envision examples that include requirements elicitation with customers, development team meetings, and discussion with potential investors, to name just a few.},

With the increasing availability of generative Artificial Intelligence Assistants, there is a renewed push to focus on higher-order skills beyond syntax and solving programming problems by matching sample outputs.This poster examines the impact of conceptual explanation-based exercises in introductory programming courses through the implementation of a scaffolded semi-flipped classroom. This method is currently in its third semester as a part of an ongoing, iterative, semi-experimental approach to support student resilience in entrance-level courses. This approach aimed to enhance student engagement, retention, and performance by integrating weekly practice sessions and "group-tutoring" sessions facilitated by peer learning assistants. In these sessions, students were encouraged to articulate their problem-solving strategies and the reasoning behind their solutions, fostering a deeper understanding of programming language paradigms and problem-solving techniques.The findings indicate that this method significantly increased classroom engagement, as students became more active participants in their learning journey. Retention rates improved as students became more confident in understanding and applying programming concepts. Overall, student performance saw a notable rise, with students demonstrating a better grasp of programming paradigms and problem-solving approaches beyond rote memorization and matching sample outputs.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the increasing number of vehicles has led to heightened traffic congestion. Traditional surveillance is limited to monitoring fixed locations. However, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography provides advantages such as convenience and a wide perspective, gradually replacing these conventional techniques for traffic video collection. Nonetheless, challenges including complex scenes, varying scales and frequent occlusions result in issues such as false positives, missed targets, and identity switches (IDSW). To tackle these, we developed the UVD detection algorithm based on YOLOv8-n and the AByteTrack tracking algorithm derived from ByteTrack. The integration of these two components forms the UVD-ATrack algorithm. In the backbone of the detection section, we introduced the RFAConv and designed RF_C2f to enhance feature extraction capabilities. For the neck component, the adaptive weight fusion module (AWFM) was developed to effectively combine multi-scale local information. During the tracking phase, we optimized the motion model. Additionally, camera motion compensation (CMC) was implemented to adaptively mitigate the effects of sharp perspective changes. Test results utilizing the Visdrone dataset indicate that mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 improved by 4.4\% and 3.6\% respectively in the detection section. In the tracking test, IDF1, HOTA, MOTA and MOTP also exhibited significant enhancement while IDSW decreased by 77\%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our proposed algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance.},

  abstract = {Most current generative models for anomaly detection, which rely on reconstruction methods, primarily use either Variational Autoencoders or Generative Adversarial Networks. However, VAEs tend to suffer from poor reconstruction quality, while GANs face challenges related to training stability and limited pattern coverage. Additionally, due to privacy and security concerns, the available training data for anomaly detection is often limited, whereas generative models typically require large datasets to avoid the risk of overfitting. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection model utilizing diffusion techniques, designed specifically for tabular data, using a reconstruction-based approach. We adopt the diffusion model as the backbone for anomaly detection, aiming to enhance reconstruction quality and ensure training stability. To further improve reconstruction quality and accelerate inference, we employ a truncated diffusion strategy during inference. What's more, to overcome the challenge of insufficient training data, we introduce a SMOTE-based data augmentation method optimized for feature space in tabular data, incorporating a VAE to address the limitations of the original SMOTE algorithm in capturing complex data structures and handling nonlinear relationships. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate that our method achieves higher detection accuracy compared to conventional methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

  abstract = {The adoption of learning analytics (LA) and artificial intelligence (AI) in education has long been a challenge, in part due to the ethical issues it engenders (e.g., the alignment of technology-embedded and human stakeholder values). Value-sensitive design (VSD) is a human-centered and theory-grounded approach to technology design that explicitly elicits and accounts for human values. However, there is scant concrete guidance on how to involve students in co-designing LA technologies from a VSD perspective, in an efficient manner. This paper presents a novel method, called VALA/AID, to elicit student values, challenges and motivations, in the early stages of an LA design process. We briefly illustrate the application of the method and the kind of evidence and design insights that can be distilled from it, for a relatively under-explored context in LA research: doctoral education.},

We also propose a metric (CLIP score ) to guide which denoising steps will conduct fusion.

  abstract = {The first typical generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) model ChatGpt 1 was introduced in 2018, but has not drawn much attention until the release of ChatGpt 3 in 2022. Since then, researchers and educators have been experimenting with Gen AI tools to explore their possibilities in various fields. In education, the use of Gen AI in assessment is a research focus. To reveal the research patterns in this field, the study employed Vosviewer and CiteSpace to analyze 816 papers in the Web of Science (WOS) database published between 2019 and 2024. The annual publications surged during the period of 2023-2024 due to the release of higher versions of Gen AI tools such as ChatGpt 3. Researchers in the United States, United Kingdom and China engage most actively in the field. American and Hong Kong universities are particularly productive. However, the collaboration between institutions and authors still needs to be enhanced. Highly influential journals such as Nature and famous medical journals such as JMIR Medical Education and Cureus Journal of Medical sciences are most frequently cited. The analysis of co-occurrence keywords and keyword clusters identified two research areas: responding to the academic integrity issue with the use of Gen AI in assessment and exploring the valuable use of Gen AI in assessments in higher education especially medical education. Future research could explore the design of innovative or alternative assessments and the use of Gen AI tools in interactive and game-based assessment creation, marking and feedback giving.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an Android certificate validation vulnerability detection framework that integrates static analysis, adversarial sample training, and optimization via large language models. Centered around the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network, the framework aims to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of static detection models against complex and obfuscated attack patterns. Static analysis is performed on 2,000 popular Android applications from the androzoo dataset, with code and configuration features extracted, focusing on certificate-related API usage, permission declarations, and network security settings. Among them, 110 APKs are identified as containing high-risk certificate misconfigurations. Based on these features, a Transformer-based model is constructed for feature vectorization and vulnerability identification. To further improve model robustness, WGAN is employed to generate adversarial samples that mimic real-world evasive vulnerabilities, which are used for adversarial training. Additionally, large language models are used to perform In-Context Learning, enabling semantic filtering, sample refinement, and iterative generator feedback. This results in a closed-loop, self-improving detection pipeline that combines detection, optimization, and feedback. Experimental results across standard, adversarial, and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves an F1 score of 0.91 and reduces the false positive rate to 7.2\%, significantly outperforming traditional static detection tools in both accuracy and resilience.},

  abstract = {While educational researchers in various disciplines are grappling with how to develop policies and pedagogical approaches that address the use of generative artificial intelligence, the challenge is particularly complex in computer science education where the new technology is changing the core of the field. In this paper, we take a look at the pedagogy of other subjects with a longer history than computer science and a more extensive body of educational research to collect insights on how this challenge can be met. We begin by drawing from recent neurological research to find domains that share cognitive commonalities with computer programming and then build upon comparisons that others have made to literacy and mathematics education. We then consider how the "reading wars" and "math wars" have shaped these fields, which we see as conflicts between less effective top-down pedagogy and more effective bottom-up pedagogy, and reflect on what would be comparable approaches in teaching computing. We find that approaches that make heavy use of large language models without teaching fundamentals can be compared to the top-down pedagogy of reading and mathematics and are likely to be ineffective on their own. Therefore, we advise against the exclusive use of such approaches with novices. However, we also acknowledge that the social science surrounding computer science education is complex and that effectiveness only tells a part of the story, with other factors such as engagement, motivation and social dynamics also being important.},

From all of these, we distilled our findings in the form of 5 insights. We found that the skills \&amp; knowledge to be a successful AI-enhanced developer are organized into four domains (using Generative AI effectively, core software engineering, adjacent engineering, and adjacent non-engineering) deployed at critical junctures throughout a 6-step task workflow. In order to "future proof" developers for this age of AI, on-the-job learning initiatives and computer science degree programs will need to target both "soft" skills and the technical skills \&amp; knowledge in all four domains to reskill, upskill and safeguard against deskilling.},

This is critical in the era of generative artificial intelligence and pervasive digital technologies, where technology design substantially shapes what and how humans are learning. This paper introduces “support for learning” as an explicit design goal for everyday technologies. To provide background, we first differentiate four relationships between learning and technology: (1) learning to use technology, (2) learning about technology, (3) learning as a primary design goal, and (4) learning through technology. Designers can intentionally facilitate the latter (a) by following established design principles for usability and user experience, but need to go beyond such known ground by (b) identifying potential learning goals, and (c) connecting to high-quality learning resources and technology designed from within the system. A future research agenda should investigate the relationships between patterns of technology design, patterns of technology use, and learning.},

  abstract = {The systematic testing of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models by collaborative teams and distributed individuals, often called red-teaming, is a core part of the infrastructure that ensures that AI models do not produce harmful content. Unlike past technologies, the black box nature of generative AI systems necessitates a uniquely interactional mode of testing, one in which individuals on red teams actively interact with the system, leveraging natural language to simulate malicious actors and solicit harmful outputs. This interactional labor done by red teams can result in mental health harms that are uniquely tied to the adversarial engagement strategies necessary to effectively red team. The importance of ensuring that generative AI models do not propagate societal or individual harm is widely recognized—one less visible foundation of end-to-end AI safety is also the protection of the mental health and wellbeing of those who work to keep model outputs safe. In this paper, we argue that the unmet mental health needs of AI red-teamers are a critical workplace safety concern. Through analyzing the unique mental health impacts associated with the labor done by red teams, we propose potential individual and organizational strategies that could be used to meet these needs, and safeguard the mental health of red-teamers. We develop our proposed strategies through drawing parallels between common red-teaming practices and interactional labor common to other professions (including actors, mental health professionals, conflict photographers, and content moderators), describing how individuals and organizations within these professional spaces safeguard their mental health given similar psychological demands. Drawing on these protective practices, we describe how safeguards could be adapted for the distinct mental health challenges experienced by red teaming organizations as they mitigate emerging technological risks on the new digital frontlines. Note: This work includes descriptions of violence, trauma, and mental illness.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice-Conversion (VC) using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have made it possible to generate high-quality and realistic human-like audio. This introduces significant challenges to distinguishing AI-synthesized speech from the authentic human voice and could raise potential issues of misuse for malicious purposes such as impersonation and fraud, spreading misinformation, deepfakes, and scams. However, existing detection techniques for AI-synthesized audio have not kept pace and often exhibit poor generalization across diverse datasets. In this article, we introduce SONAR, a synthetic AI-Audio Detection Framework and Benchmark, aiming at providing a comprehensive evaluation for distinguishing cutting-edge AI-synthesized auditory content. SONAR includes a novel evaluation dataset sourced from 9 diverse audio synthesis platforms, including leading TTS providers and state-of-the-art TTS models. It is the first framework to uniformly benchmark AI-audio detection across both traditional and foundation model-based deepfake detection systems. Through extensive experiments, (1) we reveal the generalization limitations of existing detection methods and demonstrate that foundation models exhibit stronger generalization capabilities, which can be attributed to their model size and the scale and quality of pretraining data. (2) Our evaluation of the generalization across languages suggests that speech foundation models demonstrate robust cross-lingual generalization capabilities, maintaining strong performance across diverse languages despite being fine-tuned solely on English speech data. This finding also suggests that the primary challenges in audio deepfake detection are more closely tied to the realism and quality of synthetic audio rather than language-specific characteristics. (3) We also explore the effectiveness and efficiency of few-shot fine-tuning in improving generalization, highlighting its potential for tailored applications, such as personalized detection systems for specific entities or individuals.

Not because there is no potential for harm from AI systems and not because AI systems should not be regulated, but because “Artificial Intelligence” is a vaguely defined label that is neither suitable nor necessary for comprehensive regulation of technological risks. Instead of regulating a particular set of approaches and algorithms, lawmakers should focus and double down on regulating high-risk applications of software, independent of whether it is labelled as AI or not.},

  abstract = {Oral traditions, vital to cultural identity, are losing relevance among youth due to the dominance of modern media. This study addresses the revitalization of these traditions by reconnecting young people with folklore. We introduce&nbsp;Anansi the Spider VR, a novel virtual space that combines first-person virtual reality (VR) with generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI)-driven narrative personalization. This space immerses users in the story of Anansi the Spider, empowering them to influence the narrative by envisioning themselves as the protagonists, thereby enhancing personal reflection. In a 2 \texttimes{} 2 between-subjects study with 48 participants, we employed a mixed-method approach to measure user engagement and changes in interest, complemented by semi-structured interviews providing qualitative insights into personalization and immersion. Our results indicate that personalization in VR significantly enhances engagement and cultural interest. We recommend that future studies using VR and Gen-AI to revitalize oral storytelling, maintain cultural integrity, and involve cultural communities to ensure authentic, respectful narratives.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has recently made rapid advancements, blurring the boundaries of intelligence between humans and machines. Its characteristic of generating different answers to the same question often evokes the thought process of humans. This study explores how AI-generated code, with minimal human intervention, can improve performance. There are over 100 algorithms capable of solving an NP-hard problem, the traveling salesperson problem, and it is difficult for one person to know all of them. Therefore, it is nearly impossible for a human to manually combine the advantages of various algorithms into a hybrid code. However, by leveraging AI, even someone who has no knowledge of the algorithms can generate a hybrid code that combines the strengths of different algorithms. In this experiment, AI-generated codes based on multiple algorithms are applied to genetic algorithms. The performance of hybrid codes, after undergoing crossover and mutation, was evaluated. The results showed that the performance of the AI-generated hybrid code surpassed that of the best-performing single algorithm code. This study demonstrates that AI can go beyond the mere application of existing algorithms by autonomously generating code and combining different algorithms to implement hybrid optimization techniques.},

  abstract = {Chinese Spelling Error Correction, which aims to detect and correct spelling mistakes in Chinese text, is an essential branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. However, the similarity of character sounds and shapes poses considerable challenges in Chinese spelling correction. Although significant progress has been made in the BERT-based Masked Language Models (MLMs) incorporating phonological and morphological information, further research is needed on improving correction accuracy in multiple error scenarios. Therefore, the paper proposes the Chinese Error Correction based on Whole Words Replacement fusing Confusion Set (WWR-CS) model which utilizes the whole words replacement method, incorporating confusion set in the noise generation module. Furthermore, due to the fact that most spelling errors stem from phonetic misuse, the model incorporates the pronunciation of Chinese characters and comprehensively considers character correction and pinyin prediction to obtain the final correction result. The experimental results on the Sighan datasets exhibits improved performance compared to the models proposed in recent years, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

  abstract = {The integration of generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) into everyday life raises questions about the competencies required to critically engage with these technologies. Unlike visual errors in genAI, textual mistakes are often harder to detect and require specific domain knowledge. Furthermore, AI’s authoritative tone and structured responses can create an illusion of correctness, leading to overtrust, especially among children. To address this, we developed AI Puzzlers, an interactive system based on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), to help children identify and analyze errors in genAI. Drawing on Mayer \&amp; Moreno’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, AI Puzzlers uses visual and verbal elements to reduce cognitive overload and support error detection. Based on two participatory design sessions with 21 children (ages 6 - 11), our findings provide both design insights and an empirical understanding of how children identify errors in genAI reasoning, develop strategies for navigating these errors, and evaluate AI outputs.},
