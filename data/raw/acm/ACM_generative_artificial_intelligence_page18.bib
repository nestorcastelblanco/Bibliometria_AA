abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly integrated into our daily routines. Recognizing the significance of AI, educators are expected not only to teach about AI but also to utilize AI tools in their teaching, ensuring that their students are equipped with the necessary knowledge to navigate the AI-driven society. Thus, it is important to understand how educators perceive AI. In this study, we explore educators’ perceptions of AI, as well as whether they teach AI, the challenges they face in teaching AI, potential support for teaching AI in the future, and possible differences between Cypriot and international educators. Two online surveys, involving 197 educators, followed by interviews with 10 Cypriot educators were conducted to examine how they perceive AI. The findings revealed a shared conceptualization of AI as “human-like”, intelligent machines, capable of learning and solving problems using data. Notable differences in the definitions of AI emerged between Cypriot educators and their international counterparts. Furthermore, the findings showed that even though educators perceive teaching AI as important, they lack formal training and specialized educational tools on AI, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions and tailored resources.},

abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.},

Yet, users’ understanding of how such ecosystems work remains unknown. In this paper, we investigate users’ mental models of how GenAI Chatbot Ecosystems work. This is an important question because users’ mental models guide their behaviors, including making decisions that impact their privacy. Through 21 semi-structured interviews, we uncovered users’ four mental models towards first-party (e.g., Google Gemini) and third-party (e.g., ChatGPT) GenAI Chatbot Ecosystems. These mental models centered around the role of the chatbot in the entire ecosystem. We further found that participants held a more consistent and simpler mental model towards third-party ecosystems than the first-party ones, resulting in higher trust and fewer concerns towards the third-party ecosystems. We discuss the design and policy implications based on our results.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized different aspects of society, including higher education. This paper investigates faculty members' perceptions of using artificial intelligence, chatbots, and generative AI in teaching and learning in Uzbeki's higher education contexts. The researchers employed a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to collect the data. Purposeful sampling was employed to select participants in this study, and the interviews were conducted face-to-face at the university campus. The study's underlying theory is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, including effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, which were employed as a lens to direct the research. The data were transcribed and analyzed using the deductive approach for the thematic analysis. The findings revealed that lecturers have a positive attitude to adopt and use AI for content creation, assessment and feedback, and doing research in their institution. Some instructors may see it as a valuable tool for generating creative content and aiding student learning. In contrast, others may have concerns about its potential to replace human creativity or biases in generated materials. Lecturers also view AI as a technology to achieve accessibility and equity after overcoming the challenges. Findings revealed that some measurements should be taken about the facilitating conditions and the perceived risks of using AI.},

abstract = {Socio-technological developments are driving the profound impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on education. Driven by the “disruptive technology revolution” in different fields, AI is reshaping knowledge acquisition, teaching and learning, from personalized learning systems to the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the traditional “factory” mode of education is difficult to adapt to personalized learning development needs. Learning development needs, and artificial intelligence-driven systems in support of adaptive learning, intelligent tutoring and automatic assessment, in addition to greatly improve the learning efficiency “liberation of productivity”, but also to change the way of knowledge transfer, affect human cognition and independent learning. It is foreseeable that the competition for education in the age of artificial intelligence may shift from knowledge accumulation to computational power domination. That is to say, individuals with more computing power will have access to better learning resources, which will definitely increase the “digital education gap” on the other hand. This paper analyzes the current situation, challenges, and future trends of AI in education, and explores the impact of AI on self-directed learning, cognitive processes, and the possible evolution of education towards computational competitiveness. Using research methods such as literature review, case study, and technology trend prediction, this study combines the theories of cognitive science, philosophy of AI, and pedagogy to assess the educational impact of AI and propose policy recommendations to promote equity and optimize AI cooperation.},

abstract = {Underwater optical object detection (UOD), aiming at identifying and localising objects in underwater optical images or videos, presents significant challenges due to the optical distortion, water turbidity, and changing illumination in underwater scenes. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) based methods, especially deep learning methods, have shown promising performance in UOD. To further facilitate future advancements, we comprehensively study AI-based UOD. In this survey, we first categorise existing algorithms into traditional machine learning-based methods and deep learning-based methods, and summarise them by considering learning strategies, experimental datasets, learning stages, employed features or techniques, and underlying frameworks. Next, we discuss the potential challenges and suggest possible solutions and new directions. We also perform both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of mainstream algorithms across multiple benchmark datasets, taking into account the diversity and biases in experimental setups. Finally, we introduce two off-the-shelf detection analysis tools, Diagnosis and TIDE, which will examine the effects of object characteristics and various types of errors on detector performance. These tools help identify the strengths and weaknesses of different detectors, providing insights for further improvement. The source code, trained models, utilised datasets, detection results, and detection analysis tools are publicly available at  and will be regularly updated.},

abstract = {The study builds an AI support framework based on Tomlinson's theory, and achieves accurate learning diagnosis through five-dimensional data (cognitive, behavioural, emotional, environmental and social). Practice has proven that AI can dynamically optimise teaching. However, there are challenges in AI application: over-reliance on technology undermines teacher-student interaction, algorithmic bias exacerbates educational injustice, and data privacy risks need to be regulated. The study emphasises that AI in education should be based on the essence of “educating people”, and promote the role of teachers to shift from “knowledge transfer” to “growth guidance” under the ethical framework, and synergise technological empowerment and humanistic care. The future needs to explore localised adaptation paths. In the future, it is necessary to explore the local adaptation path, not only to make use of AI to break through the bottleneck of large-scale education but also to prevent the alienation of the technology, and build an intelligent education ecology of “teaching in accordance with one's aptitude”.},

In the medical realm, AI takes a pivotal role, leveraging robust machine learning (ML) algorithms. AI technology in medical imaging aids physicians in X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnoses, conducts pattern recognition and disease prediction based on acoustic data, delivers prognoses on disease types and developmental trends for patients, and employs intelligent health management wearable devices with human-computer interaction technology to name but a few. While these well-established applications have significantly assisted in medical field diagnoses, clinical decision-making, and management, collaboration between the medical and AI sectors faces an urgent challenge: How to substantiate the reliability of decision-making? The underlying issue stems from the conflict between the demand for accountability and result transparency in medical scenarios and the black-box model traits of AI. This article reviews recent research grounded in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), with an emphasis on medical practices within the visual, audio, and multimodal perspectives. We endeavor to categorize and synthesize these practices, aiming to provide support and guidance for future researchers and healthcare professionals.},

abstract = {In the context of the information era of rapid development of artificial intelligence, the frequency of data updating and the role of data is always in dynamic change, and the research of design behavior is facing new opportunities and challenges. This paper focuses on the study of factors affecting design behavior in the view of artificial intelligence, aiming to analyze the weight of each influencing factor accurately. Through the hierarchical analysis method (AHP), its advantage of quantitative subjective judgment is brought into play, and experts' subjective perception of the importance of design behavior factors is deeply explored. At the same time, combined with the entropy weight method, the weights are determined based on the objective information entropy of the data, which effectively makes up for the lack of subjective assignment. Using the AHP-entropy weight method combined with these two methods, a comprehensive and systematic weight evaluation of design behavior factors is carried out to improve the efficiency of multi-attribute decision-making.},

To address these challenges, this paper describes the design of a multilingual chatbot for Bengali-English customer service interactions utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and targeted prompt engineering. This research provides valuable insights for the human-computer interaction (HCI) community, emphasizing the importance of designing systems that accommodate linguistic diversity to benefit both customers and businesses.

abstract = {Alternative text (alt text) or image descriptions for scientific figures make them accessible to screen reader users. Yet, generating high-quality alt text remains a significant challenge, particularly for people lacking subject-matter expertise. Emerging AI tools, such as generative AI, can help people understand contexts where they lack subject expertise. This work explores how university Disability Services Office (DSO) professionals write alt text for scientific figures without subject expertise. We conducted a user study with 12 DSO professionals who authored alt text for scientific figures, first without and then using generative AI. We assessed the participants’ processes for alt text generation and their confidence in the resulting output. We also conducted semi-structured interviews to understand DSO professionals’ experiences with the alt text generation. Our findings reveal that AI assistance improved participants’ confidence and efficiency, but introduced new challenges for interaction and trust. Participants expressed caution about relying on AI-generated descriptions without sufficient domain knowledge and editing. These insights highlight the need for AI-augmented tools that better scaffold the alt text writing process for accessibility professionals.},

Using data from an online survey of 83 ATCOS, our model explains 78.5\% of the variance in the intention to use AI. Notably, technology trust (TT) and emotion (EM) significantly influence the intention to use AI, with TT mediating the impact of perceived transparency (PT).

Teachers express a lack of understanding on incorporating ChatGPT into education and perceive a lack of support from school leadership and the Swedish National Agency for Education. Identified scenarios suggest ChatGPT’s potential for understanding concepts, but resistance toward its use in examinations. The students have a statistically significant enhancement in confidence and understanding of magnetism concepts after engaging with ChatGPT.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence has been deeply integrated into all areas of social production. At present, China's housing market has long faced the problems of supply-demand imbalance and structural imbalance, and there is an urgent need to use the technological advantages of AI to promote the intelligent transformation of supply-demand balance management. This paper constructs a theoretical model of imbalance from a national perspective, measures the scale of housing supply and demand using hyperbolic aggregation equations, quantifies the degree of regional supply-demand imbalance, and puts forward policy proposals to regulate the imbalance in the housing market by combining with AI technology, which provides a new way of thinking and a practical way for the government to realize intelligent management of the housing market.},

abstract = {Current recommendation methods based on knowledge graphs rely on entity and relation representations for several steps along the pipeline, with knowledge completion and path reasoning being the most influential. Despite their similarities, the most effective representation methods for these steps differ, leading to inefficiencies, limited representativeness, and reduced interpretability. In this paper, we introduce KGGLM, a decoder-only Transformer model designed for generalizable knowledge representation learning to support recommendation. The model is trained on generic paths sampled from the knowledge graph to capture foundational patterns, and then fine-tuned on paths specific of the downstream step (knowledge completion and path reasoning in our case). Experiments on ML1M and LFM1M show that KGGLM beats twenty-two baselines in effectiveness under both knowledge completion and recommendation.

abstract = {Nowadays, the global digital transformation of healthcare is advancing rapidly with the help of technologies such as electronic medical records, telemedicine, and mobile medical applications. However, there are still challenges in EMR interoperability, security, and data exchange. To address these existing limitations, This study proposes a voice electronic medical record system driven by artificial intelligence and blockchain, which is designed to improve clinical records and nursing coordination. This system adopts a dedicated deep learning architecture. It transcribe the conversations between doctors and patients into text, and then uses natural language processing to extract the relevant medical information. At the same time, it also provides diagnostic prompts, which can reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Doctors can view and edit these summaries generated by artificial intelligence. Then safely record them on the decentralized crypto blockchain ledger. With federated learning, the model can be continuously improved in multiple centers without infringing on data privacy. This solution integrates automatic speech recognition, distributed ledger technology, and collaborative deep learning, aiming to enhance the EMR efficiency, security, data integrity, and care continuity of medical institutions. The combination of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence technology holds great potential. It can transform fragmented health data into portable and interoperable records under patient control, thus bringing strategic advantages to the health system that is undergoing a comprehensive digital transformation.},

abstract = {In order to explore the design application of context-awareness in the scenic mobility scooter under the background of artificial intelligence. Firstly, the concepts of artificial intelligence, context-awareness and scenic mobility scooter are introduced, and the current status of theoretical research and existing problems of scenic mobility scooter are sorted out. Secondly, combining the advantages and characteristics of context-aware intervention in the scenic scooter, the context information related to the scenic scooter under the view of artificial intelligence is divided into four categories: user, environment, task, and equipment, and at the same time, different stages of the use of the context information hierarchy is categorized and corresponds to the pain point needs, and the corresponding artificial intelligence access points are analyzed. Finally, four design strategies are proposed based on the above four contextual factors. It is concluded that the application of context-awareness theory to the design of scenic mobility scooters under the perspective of artificial intelligence strengthens the ability to perceive multidimensional contextual information, explores the user's needs in dynamic situations from a multidimensional perspective, simplifies the user's operation path, and enhances the user's touring experience.},

abstract = {This study contributes to the global conversation on artificial intelligence (AI) literacy, with a specific focus on Uganda, a sub-Saharan African region that has received limited attention in AI education research. As AI becomes increasingly pervasive, it is essential to introduce AI concepts to young children to promote their AI literacy. However, the current landscape of AI education in Uganda is not well understood. To address this gap, this research explores a community-based approach to teaching AI and machine learning (ML) to young children in out-of-school settings. The study aims to discover the kinds of AI-related knowledge and skills that young children can develop and how they can learn about AI in a non-formal educational context. The study will employ a design science methodology (DSM) to create and evaluate practical solutions, including methods, models, and concepts, that can inform AI education in Uganda. By combining systematic literature reviews, qualitative and quantitative methods, the research will generate robust empirical evidence that supports the effectiveness and relevance of the proposed solutions. Through these methods, the research will explore the role of community-based approaches in fostering young children's AI literacy. The study will investigate the effectiveness of informal learning environments, including homes, museums, churches, and children's camps. This will provide design recommendations for community-based AI education programs and in doing so, the study addresses the limited initiatives on promoting AI education for everyone, particularly in developing regions using informal settings.},

Aimed at the AI and smart manufacturing's development in large volume and speed, English standard terminology could make international cooperation, information communication and industry standard more effective. There are main difficulties include the multidenoting and the obscurity of words, the rate new jargon, the confusion difference of industry and in language-culture difficulties, particularly language not English.For these challenges, the paper suggests ways: to establish authoritative terminology databases (i.e., ISO/TC 37) that regularly updates their definitions and use for latest version; to intensify collaborations of global and national standard bodies to create one single norm, develop one single standard to define their terminologies usage, to design for the rules of translation to reflect consistent terminologies use, and professionals’ terminology literacy in using terms. Three cases from authors show how those approaches help cross-industry and cross-cultural communications, including use of digital twin to advance the development of aircrafts, automotive, and automobile production in detail.Our research attempt combining linguistics, artificial intelligence, and manufacturing engineering in the presentation of not only theoretical foundations but also practical references for assisting effective international cooperation and normalized development of AI and smart manufacturing. In the further study, we expand the case of study on larger ranges of cultures and industrial fields in order to realize more effective terminology standardization for the current emerging technologies.},

Globally, medical AI has tremendous potential to support the United Nations’ sustainable development goals pertaining to health and well-being. In particular, large language models (LLMs) afford opportunities for positively disrupting medical AI-related research and practice. We present a research framework for LLMs in medical AI. Our framework considers the interplay between health and well-being goals, disease lifecycle stages, and the important emerging role of LLMs in medical AI processes related to various lifecycle stages. As part of our framework, we describe the LLM multiplex—important multimodal, multi-model, multicultural, and multi-responsibility considerations for LLMs in medical AI. We discuss how the five articles in the special issue relate to this framework and are helping us learn about the opportunities and challenges for LLMs in medical AI.},

Since such models will be integrated into future educational tools, a human-centered design approach that takes students’ perspectives into account is essential while designing such applications.This paper describes two co-design workshops which were conducted with 79 student groups to examine how they design and prototype future educational tools integrated with MLLMs. Through various activities in the workshops, students discussed relevant educational problems, created journey maps, storyboards and low fidelity prototypes for their applications, and evaluated their applications based on relevant design principles. We found that students’ applications used MLLMs for important learning environment design features such as multimodal content creation, personalization, and feedback. Based on these findings, we discuss future research directions for the design of multimodality in generative AI educational applications.},

We show that robustness and cybersecurity demand resilience against performance disruptions.

Our analysis informs efforts to develop harmonized standards, guidelines by the European Commission, as well as benchmarks and measurement methodologies under Art.&nbsp;15(2)&nbsp;AIA.

abstract = {Engineering process management aims to formally specify processes which are executable, measurable, and controllable. Common representations include text-based domain-specific languages (DSLs) or graphical notations such as the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN). The specification itself can be seen as a Software Product Line (SPL), building upon concepts such as tasks, UI forms, fields and actions. Domain experts provide requirements for processes but often lack the technical programming skills to formalize them in a process specification language. We present an interactive SPL application prototype that allows domain experts to model simple processes in natural language. Our framework for the reliable generation of formal specifications with Large Language Models (LLMs) supports the machine-translation from natural language to a JSON-based process DSL. In this case study, five domain experts were asked to model any process of their choice through natural-language interactions. As a result, the user interface corresponding to the process DSL was shown as immediate feedback. We documented their perceived translation quality and interviewed them on their impressions of this methodology. An average user-assessed performance rating of 68\% was achieved. Even though the modelling strategies differed greatly between individuals, the tool was able to adequately capture the majority of instructions, leaving an overall positive impression on the participants. More context awareness and additional conventional interaction elements were the main aspects found to be improved for a productive implementation.},
