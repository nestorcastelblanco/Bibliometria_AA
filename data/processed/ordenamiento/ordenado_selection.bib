 abstract = {With recent advances in AI, many technology firms and developers are exploring whether Generative AI (GenAI) tools can help improve productivity, code quality and the overall developer experience. Current evaluations primarily depend on subjective questionnaire data or code quality metrics. A supplemental objective, continuous, real-time developer-centered measure is missing. Wearables with body sensors that measure the physiological activity of a person have the aforementioned benefits. With their help, impeding factors from GenAI tools on a developer's well-being and cognitive load may be detected. Implications for productivity may be deduced from these cognitive load measures. This research aims to use body sensor data to (1) assess the ability of wearables to measure developers' cognitive load in their everyday working context to then (2) evaluate developer experience, productivity and GenAI interactions in real-life work environments. A holistic mixed-method approach by combining subjective and objective measures in a developer-centered manner is taken.},

 abstract = {Execution tracing is essential for understanding system and software behaviour, yet lost trace events can significantly compromise data integrity and analysis. Existing solutions for trace reconstruction often fail to fully leverage available data, particularly in complex and high-dimensional contexts. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence, particularly diffusion models, have set new benchmarks in image, audio, and natural language generation. This study conducts the first comprehensive evaluation of diffusion models for reconstructing incomplete trace event sequences. Using nine distinct datasets generated from the Phoronix Test Suite, we rigorously test these models on sequences of varying lengths and missing data ratios. Our results indicate that the SSSDS4 model, in particular, achieves superior performance, in terms of accuracy, perfect rate, and ROUGE-L score across diverse imputation scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of diffusion-based models to accurately reconstruct missing events, thereby maintaining data integrity and enhancing system monitoring and analysis.},

 abstract = {Simulation-based testing is widely used to assess the reliability of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), but its effectiveness is limited by the operational design domain (ODD) conditions available in such simulators. To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then performed system-level testing to evaluate the ability of the ADS to generalize to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help to increase the coverage of ODD for system-level ADS testing. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3\%, retaining the correctness and quality of the images generated for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing.},

 abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence extends beyond its success in image/text synthesis, proving itself a powerful uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique through its capability to sample from complex high-dimensional probability distributions. However, existing methods often require a complicated training process, which greatly hinders their applications to real-world UQ problems, especially in dynamic UQ tasks where the target probability distribution evolves rapidly with time. To alleviate this challenge, we have developed a scalable, training-free score-based diffusion model for high-dimensional sampling. We incorporate a parallel-in-time method into our diffusion model to use a large number of GPUs to solve the backward stochastic differential equation and generate new samples of the target distribution. Moreover, we also distribute the computation of the large matrix subtraction used by the training-free score estimator onto multiple GPUs available across all nodes. Compared to existing methods, our approach completely avoids training the score function, making it capable of adapting to rapid changes in the target probability distribution. We showcase the remarkable strong and weak scaling capabilities of the proposed method on the Frontier supercomputer, as well as its uncertainty reduction capability in hurricane predictions when coupled with AI-based foundation models.},

However, their scale and complexity pose significant challenges for processing and analysis. In this paper we discuss our experiences in developing and using a scientific research application using an automated multi-facility workflow that orchestrates data collection, preprocessing, artificial intelligence (AI) inferencing, and data movement across diverse computational resources, leveraging the Advanced Computing Ecosystem Testbed at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF). We demonstrate that our workflow can be seamlessly integrated and orchestrated across research facilities managed by different federal agencies, thus allowing users to extract new scientific insights from climate datasets. The experimental results indicate that the multi-facility workflow significantly reduces processing time, enhances scalability, and maintains high efficiency across varying workloads. Notably, our workflow processes 12,000 high-resolution satellite images in just 44 seconds using 80 workers distributed across 10 nodes on the OLCF systems. Such high throughput is essential for dynamic tokenization and sharding of petascale satellite data for distributed AI model training and inferencing at scale across thousands of GPUs.},

 abstract = {Concrete is the most widely used engineered material in the world with more than 10 billion tons produced annually. Unfortunately, with that scale comes a significant burden in terms of energy, water, and release of greenhouse gases and other pollutants; indeed 8\% of worldwide carbon emissions are attributed to the production of cement, a key ingredient in concrete. As such, there is interest in creating concrete formulas that minimize this environmental burden, while satisfying engineering performance requirements including compressive strength. Specifically for computing, concrete is a major ingredient in the construction of data centers. In this work, we use conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs), a type of semi-supervised generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, to discover concrete formulas with desired properties. Our model is trained just using a small open dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository joined with environmental impact data from standard lifecycle analysis. Computational predictions demonstrate CVAEs can design concrete formulas with much lower carbon requirements than existing formulations while meeting design requirements. Next we report laboratory-based compressive strength experiments for five AI-generated formulations, which demonstrate that the formulations exceed design requirements. The resulting formulations were then used by Ozinga Ready Mix—a concrete supplier—to generate field-ready concrete formulations, based on local conditions and their expertise in concrete design. Finally, we report on how these formulations were used in the construction of buildings and structures in a Meta data center in DeKalb, IL, USA. Results from field experiments as part of this real-world deployment corroborate the efficacy of AI-generated low-carbon concrete mixes.},

A key question, then, is whether people believe news headlines generated by AI as much as news headlines generated by humans. AI is viewed as lacking human motives and emotions, suggesting that people might view news written by AI as more accurate. By contrast, two pre-registered experiments on representative U.S. samples (N = 4,034) showed that people rated news headlines written by AI as less accurate than those written by humans. People were more likely to incorrectly rate news headlines written by AI (vs. a human) as inaccurate when they were actually true, and more likely to correctly rate them as inaccurate when they were indeed false.

 abstract = {Tasks are central to information retrieval (IR) and drive interactions with search systems [2, 4, 10]. Understanding and modeling tasks helps these systems better support user needs [8, 9, 11]. This keynote focuses on search tasks, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the implications of recent work at their intersection for the future of search. Recent estimates suggest that half of Web search queries go unanswered, many of them connected to complex search tasks that are ill-defined or multi-step and span several queries[6]. AI copilots, e.g., ChatGPT and Bing Chat, are emerging to address complex search tasks and many other challenges. These copilots are built on large foundation models such as GPT-4 and are being extended with skills and plugins. Copilots broaden the surface of tasks achievable via search, moving toward creation not just finding (e.g., interview preparation, email composition), and can make searchers more efficient and more successful.Users currently engage with AI copilots via natural language queries and dialog and the copilots generate answers with source attribution [7]. However, in delegating responsibility for answer generation, searchers also lose some control over aspects of the search process, such as directly manipulating queries and examining lists of search results [1]. The efficiency gains from auto-generating a single, synthesized answer may also reduce opportunities for user learning and serendipity. A wholesale move to copilots for all search tasks is neither practical nor necessary: model inference is expensive, conversational interfaces are unfamiliar to many users in a search context, and traditional search already excels for many types of task. Instead, experiences that unite search and chat are becoming more common, enabling users to adjust the modality and other aspects (e.g., answer tone) based on the task.The rise of AI copilots creates many opportunities for IR, including aligning generated answers with user intent, tasks, and applications via human feedback [3]; understanding copilot usage, including functional fixedness [5]; using context and data to tailor responses to people and situations (e.g., grounding, personalization); new search experiences (e.g., unifying search and chat); reliability and safety (e.g., accuracy, bias); understanding impacts on user learning and agency; and evaluation (e.g., model-based feedback, searcher simulations [12] repeatability). Research in these and related areas will enable search systems to more effectively utilize new copilot technologies together with traditional search to help searchers better tackle a wider variety of tasks.},

 abstract = {This workshop aims to design advanced empathic user interfaces for in-vehicle displays, particularly for high-level automated vehicles (SAE level 3 or higher). Incorporating model-based approaches for understanding human emotion regulation, it seeks to enhance the user-vehicle interaction. A unique aspect of this workshop is the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the design process. The workshop will explore generative AI’s potential in crafting contextual responses and its impact on user experience and interface design. The agenda includes brainstorming on various driving scenarios, developing emotion-oriented intervention methods, and rapid prototyping with AI tools. The anticipated outcome includes practical prototypes of affective user interfaces and insights on the role of AI in designing human-machine interactions. Through this workshop, we hope to contribute to making automated driving more accessible and enjoyable.},

 abstract = {We present AI Archive, a footwear design tool using generative artificial intelligence (AI) that we successfully integrated into the design process at adidas. AI Archive is based on diffusion models and was trained on the entire archive of adidas sneakers, which dates back to the company’s beginning in the 1950ies. Being trained on this unique dataset enables the AI to generate new and innovative sneaker designs that draw inspiration from the archive and pay homage to the rich history of the adidas brand. AI Archive has been rolled out to our designers as a web application in 2022. The tool has since established itself as an essential ingredient in the concept-to-prototype process of many of our designers. The proposed system gives users a high level of control over the design process, enabling them to precisely guide the AI to create designs according to their direction. We believe that the use of generative AI in footwear design has the potential to transform the industry, as it allows designers to explore hundreds of different concepts in almost no time.},

 abstract = {Generative AI has made impressive strides in enabling users to create diverse and realistic visual content such as images, videos, and audio. However, training generative models on large centralized datasets can pose challenges in terms of data privacy, security, and accessibility. Federated learning (FL) is an approach that uses decentralized techniques to collaboratively train a shared deep learning model while retaining the training data on individual edge devices to preserve data privacy. This paper proposes a novel method for training a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) across multiple data sources using FL techniques. Diffusion models, a newly emerging generative model, show promising results in achieving superior quality images than Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our proposed method Phoenix is an unconditional diffusion model that leverages strategies to improve the data diversity of generated samples even when trained on data with statistical heterogeneity or Non-IID (Non-Independent and Identically Distributed) data. We demonstrate how our approach outperforms the default diffusion model in a FL setting. These results indicate that high-quality samples can be generated by maintaining data diversity, preserving privacy, and reducing communication between data sources, offering exciting new possibilities in the field of generative AI.},

Subsequently, we will present a method that allows local editing by finding a Parts and Appearances decomposition in the GAN latent space&nbsp;[2]. Then, we will present recent works on reenactment&nbsp;[1], where the goal is to transfer the facial activity (pose, expressions, speech) of a certain person to another one, and recent works in which supervision for generation comes from language models&nbsp;[3].

Thus, we raise a specific research question: would an LLM-based system be able to search for relevant GUI layouts? To address this question, we conducted a controlled study evaluating how Instigator, an LLM-based system for searching GUI layouts of web pages by generative pre-trained training, would return GUI layouts that are relevant to a given instruction and what would be the user experience of (N =34) practitioners interacting with Instigator. Our results identify a very high similarity and a moderate correlation between the rankings of the GUI layouts generated by Instigator and the rankings of the practitioners with respect to their relevance to a given design instruction. We highlight the results obtained through thirteen UEQ+ scales that characterize the user experience of the practitioner with Instigator, which we use to discuss perspectives for improving such future tools.},

 abstract = {The application of pretrained language models in real-world business domains has gained significant attention. However, research on the practical use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to address real-world downstream tasks is limited. This study aims to enhance the routine tasks of customer service (CS) representatives, particularly in the finance domain, by applying a fine-tuning method to dialogue summarization in CS centers. KakaoBank handles an average of 15,000 CS calls daily. By employing a fine-tuning method using real-world CS dialogue data, we can reduce the time required to summarize CS dialogues and standardize summarization skills. To ensure effective dialogue summarization in the finance domain, pretrained language models should acquire additional knowledge and skills, such as specific knowledge of financial products, problem-solving abilities, and the capacity to handle emotionally charged customers. In this study, we developed a reference fine-tuned model using Polyglot-Ko (5.8B) as the baseline PLM and a dataset containing a wide range of zero-shot instructions and partially containing summarization instructions. We compared this reference model with another model fine-tuned using KakaoBank’s CS dialogues and summarization data as the instruct dataset. The results demonstrated that the fine-tuned model based on KakaoBank’s internal datasets outperformed the reference model, showing a 199\% and 12\% improvement in ROUGE-L and RDASS, respectively. This study emphasizes the significance of task-specific fine-tuning using appropriate instruct datasets for effective performance in specific downstream tasks. Considering its practical use, we suggest that fine-tuning using real-world instruct datasets is a powerful and cost-effective technique for developing generative AI in the business domain.},

 abstract = {Policy advising in government centers on the analysis of public problems and the developing of recommendations for dealing with them. In carrying out this work, policy analysts consult a variety of sources and work to synthesize that body of evidence into useful decision support documents commonly called briefing notes. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) have led to the continuing development of tools that can undertake a similar task. Given a brief prompt, a large language model (LLM) can synthesize information in content databases. This article documents the findings from an experiment that tested whether contemporary NLP technology is capable of producing public policy relevant briefing notes that expert evaluators judge to be useful. The research involved two stages. First, briefing notes were created using three models: NLP generated; human generated; and NLP generated/human edited. Next, two panels of retired senior public servants (with only one panel informed of the use of NLP in the experiment) were asked to judge the briefing notes using a heuristic evaluation rubric. The findings indicate that contemporary NLP tools were not able to, on their own, generate useful policy briefings. However, the feedback from the expert evaluators indicates that automatically generated briefing notes might serve as a useful supplement to the work of human policy analysts. And the speed with which the capabilities of NLP tools are developing, supplemented with access to a larger corpus of previously prepared policy briefings and other policy-relevant material, suggests that the quality of automatically generated briefings may improve significantly in the coming years. The article concludes with reflections on what such improvements might mean for the future practice of policy analysis.},

The pressure to "publish or perish" drives researchers to use all the tools available to try to improve their papers and their impact. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) that can create content such as text, tables, and images can be used for many tasks in academic writing such as summarizing, translating, paraphrasing, data analysis, and presentation. Therefore, AI is expected to be widely used in academic writing in the near future and have a significant impact. Understanding this impact is far from trivial and needs to be carefully studied. The first step in doing so is to be able to identify papers written with the help of AI tools. This can be done by adding metadata on the use of AI in academic results. In this paper, we embark on an initial endeavor to devise such metadata and delineate the potential advantages that the inclusion of AI-related metadata in academic publications may bring forth.},

The continuous enhancement in the quality of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC), including but not limited to images and text, is forging new paradigms for its application, particularly within the domain of Augmented Reality (AR). Nevertheless, the application of GenAI within the AR design process remains opaque.

However, users often feel uncertain about whether generative art should be considered created by AI or by themselves. Losing the sense of ownership of the outcome might impact the learning process and confidence of novice designers and design learners who seek to benefit from using Generative Design Tools. In this context, we propose OwnDiffusion, a design pipeline that utilizes Generative AI to assist in the physical prototype ideation process for novice product designers and industrial design learners while preserving their sense of ownership. The pipeline incorporates a prompt weight assessing tool, allowing designers to fine-tune the AI’s input based on their sense of ownership. We envision this method as a solution for AI-assisted design, enabling designers to maintain confidence in their creativity and ownership of a design.},

Based on our interviews, focus group discussions (FGD), and social media-based qualitative study, this paper reports how popular text-to-image GAI tools (ex., DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Firefly) are affecting various image-related local creative fields. We report how these tools limit the creative explorations of marginal artists, struggle to understand linguistic nuances, fail to generate local forms of art and architecture, and misrepresent the diversity among citizens in the image production process. Drawing from a rich body of work on critical image theory, postcolonial computing, and design politics, we explain how our findings are pertinent to HCI’s broader interest in social justice, decolonization, and global development.},

We probed them to characterize their practices, and sample their attitudes, concerns, and expectations. We found that experienced designers are confident in their originality, creativity, and empathic skills, and find GenAI’s role as assistive. They emphasized the unique human factors of “enjoyment” and “agency”, where humans remain the arbiters of “AI alignment’’. However, skill degradation, job replacement, and creativity exhaustion can adversely impact junior designers. We discuss implications for human-GenAI collaboration, specifically copyright and ownership, human creativity and agency, and AI literacy and access.

However, traditional approaches could be underperforming as they often use data-driven strategies and assume that people only need additional information about their consumption to change behavior. A proposed path to overcome this issue is to design eco-feedback to foster emotional connections with users. However, not much is known about the effectiveness of such designs. In this paper, we propose a novel care-based eco-feedback system. Central to the system is a Tamagotchi-inspired digital character named Infi who gets its life force from the user’s energy savings. Additionally, we harness the latest advancements in generative artificial intelligence to enhance emotional attachment through conversational interactions that users can have with Infi. The results of a randomized controlled experiment (N=420) convey the fact that this design increases emotional attachment, which in turn increases energy-saving behavior.},

 abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed unprecedented growth in text-to-image AI tools. Yet, much remains unknown about users’ prompt journey with such tools in the wild. In this paper, we posit that designing human-centered text-to-image AI tools requires a clear understanding of how individuals intuitively approach crafting prompts, and what challenges they may encounter. To address this, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 existing users of a text-to-image AI tool. Our findings (1) offer insights into users’ prompt journey including structures and processes for writing, evaluating, and refining prompts in text-to-image AI tools and (2) indicate that users must overcome barriers to aligning AI to their intents, and mastering prompt crafting knowledge. From the findings, we discuss the prompt journey as an individual yet a social experience and highlight opportunities for aligning text-to-image AI tools and users’ intents.},

 abstract = {Children with high-functioning autism (HFA) often face challenges in emotional recognition and expression, leading to emotional distress and social difficulties. Conversational agents developed for HFA children in previous studies show limitations in children's learning effectiveness due to the conversational agents’ inability to dynamically generate personalized and contextual content. Recent advanced generative Artificial Intelligence techniques, with the capability to generate substantial diverse and high-quality texts and visual content, offer an opportunity for personalized assistance in emotional learning for HFA children. Based on the findings of our formative study, we integrated large language models and text-to-image models to develop a tool named EmoEden supporting children with HFA. Over a 22-day study involving six HFA children, it is observed that EmoEden effectively engaged children and improved their emotional recognition and expression abilities. Additionally, we identified the advantages and potential risks of applying generative AI to assist HFA children in emotional learning.},

Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. Following successful workshops in 2022 and 2023, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations.

Although this technology has raised great concerns about its misuse and harmful applications, it holds great potential to revolutionize traditional ways of teaching and learning. The use of GenAI in education has increased markedly, however, pedagogical research on this rapidly emerging technology is yet to be studied extensively. There is an urgent need to investigate the unexamined potential of this technology. Therefore, this ongoing research will explore the potential of AI-generated pedagogical agents (PA), or avatars, in instructional videos to facilitate learning. The effects of the type of PA (AI-generated, real-life human), and voice (AI-generated, human voice) on an individual's learning outcomes, cognitive load, motivation, and attention will be studied. Findings from a pilot study provide some preliminary evidence that PA appearance influences learners’ retention and cognitive load, but not attention. The type of PA influenced learners' perception of the agent's ability to facilitate learning, its human-like qualities, and its engagement level. However, it did not affect its credibility. This ongoing work will contribute to the growing understanding of the impact of AI in education, provide evidence of the efficacy of AI-generated PAs in instructional videos for learning, and narrow the gap between human-computer interaction research and education.},

Through a user study involving ten qualitative researchers, we found ChatGPT to be a valuable collaborator for thematic analysis, enhancing coding efficiency, aiding initial data exploration, offering granular quantitative insights, and assisting comprehension for non-native speakers and non-experts. Yet, concerns about its trustworthiness and accuracy, reliability and consistency, limited contextual understanding, and broader acceptance within the research community persist. We contribute five actionable design recommendations to foster effective human-AI collaboration. These include incorporating transparent explanatory mechanisms, enhancing interface and integration capabilities, prioritising contextual understanding and customisation, embedding human-AI feedback loops and iterative functionality, and strengthening trust through validation mechanisms.},

Interestingly, participants who had tried the technology rated its future importance lower than those who had not tried it.

 abstract = {Video streaming stands as the cornerstone of telecommunication networks, constituting over 60\% of mobile data traffic as of June 2023. The paramount challenge faced by video streaming service providers is ensuring high Quality of Experience (QoE) for users. In HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS), including DASH and HLS, video content is encoded at multiple quality versions, with an Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithm dynamically selecting versions based on network conditions. Concurrently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the industry, particularly in content recommendation and personalization. Leveraging user data and advanced algorithms, AI enhances user engagement, satisfaction, and video quality through super-resolution and denoising techniques.However, challenges persist, such as real-time processing on resource-constrained devices, the need for diverse training datasets, privacy concerns, and model interpretability. Despite these hurdles, the promise of Generative Artificial Intelligence emerges as a transformative force. Generative AI, capable of synthesizing new data based on learned patterns, holds vast potential in the video streaming landscape. In the context of video streaming, it can create realistic and immersive content, adapt in real time to individual preferences, and optimize video compression for seamless streaming in low-bandwidth conditions.This research proposal outlines a comprehensive exploration at the intersection of advanced AI algorithms and digital entertainment, focusing on the potential of generative AI to elevate video quality, user interactivity, and the overall streaming experience. The objective is to integrate generative models into video streaming pipelines, unraveling novel avenues that promise a future of dynamic, personalized, and visually captivating streaming experiences for viewers.},

 abstract = {This article aims to explore the consistency between a few popular generative AI robots in the evaluation of e-learning platforms. The three robots adopted in the study were GPT-4, Sage, and Dragonfly, which were requested to award rating scores to the six major dimensions, namely (1) features and capabilities, (2) ease of use and customization, (3) cost, (4) security, (5) customer support, and (6) scalability, of 10 to 20 currently most popular e-learning platforms. For each of the three robots, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the rating scores for each of the six dimensions were computed across all the e-learning platforms. The rating score difference for each of the six dimensions between any pair of robots was calculated for each platform. The mean of the absolute value, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the differences for each dimensions between each pair of robots were calculated across all platforms. Finally, a Cronbach alpha coefficient of the rating scores was computed for each of the six dimensions between all the three robots across all the e-learning platforms. The computational results were to reveal whether the three robots accorded discrimination in evaluating each dimension across the platforms and whether there was consistency between the three robots in evaluating each dimension across the platforms. Among some auxiliary results, it was found that the evaluation by the three robots was severely inconsistent for the two dimensions cost and security, inconsistent to a lesser extent for the dimension scalability, and consistent for the remaining three dimensions.},

These systems offer exciting capabilities for CS Education (CSEd), such as generating programs, that students can well utilize for their learning. Among the many dimensions that might affect the effective adoption of GenAI for CSEd, in this paper, we investigate students' trust. Trust in GenAI influences the extent to which students adopt GenAI, in turn affecting their learning. In this paper, we present results from a survey of 253 students at two large universities to understand how much they trust GenAI tools and their feedback on how GenAI impacts their performance in CS courses. Our results show that students have different levels of trust in GenAI. We also observe different levels of confidence and motivation, highlighting the need for further understanding of factors impacting trust.},

 abstract = {In Summer 2023, we developed and integrated a suite of AI-based software tools into CS50 at Harvard University. These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course's own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had "a personal tutor.'' Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues. In this paper, we detail how AI tools have augmented teaching and learning in CS50, specifically in explaining code snippets, improving code style, and accurately responding to curricular and administrative queries on the course's discussion forum. Additionally, we present our methodological approach, implementation details, and guidance for those considering using these tools or AI generally in education.},

Such chat interfaces are based on large language models (LLMs) and possess a vast array of abilities spanning conversation, the writing and debugging of code, the writing of papers, and the creation of images, music, and songs. With students now having access to a myriad of GAI tools, academia has been permanently altered.Our proposed system, named Code Analysis and Education Tutor (CAET), integrates GAI into early Computer Science education by providing students with an ethical alternative to existing GAI tools. CAET is designed to assist students with programming tasks in a manner tailored to their individual needs without jeopardizing the integrity of their learning. A point of uniqueness from existing works is CAET's ability to display or hide generated code based on its pertinence to the problem at hand. After subjecting multiple GAI models to common programming errors and queries, we settled on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model due to its comprehensive capabilities and cost-effectiveness. Overall, CAET underscored the model's conversational dynamics and provided insights for creating a more personalized learning experience for students in an introductory computer science course.},

Given the widespread use of this tool and the lack of knowledge over how it can support learning, there is a need for educators to have a framework for using it in the classroom and teaching their students usage strategies that are beneficial for learning. One pathway forward is through creativity, a process crucial for learning and also connected to the act of using gen-AI. This poster demonstrates the results of a study designed to provide an in-depth view on how creativity intersects with gen-AI usage in a computational physics course. In the course, students learn about computing tools during group-based, open-ended computational physics activities. Students are often tasked with using gen-AI to explore and help make decisions. The findings demonstrate a connection between using gen-AI and engaging in creative processes, and the implications point to strategies for supporting student usage of gen-AI.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have revolutionized information retrieval and content generation, opening up new opportunities for the e-commerce industry. In particular, text-to-image generation models offer a novel approach to guiding the image generation process using natural language input, which is inspiring for multimodal search advertising. Traditional multimodal search ads require advertisers to prepare ad creatives, such as ad images, which is time-consuming and requires uniform image specifications and content quality inspection. To this end, we propose a streamlined generation framework for search ad image creatives. First, we prepare a Chinese image caption model with high-quality image-caption pairs to bootstrap training data refinement. With curated high-quality images and synthesized descriptive captions, we then train a Chinese text-to-image generation model, the largest to date, using SDXL and a 10-billion multimodal text encoder. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage bilingual multimodal representation alignment process to seamlessly integrate the text encoder with the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, including assessments of image captioning and image generation. The implementation of our framework in Baidu Search Ads shows significant revenue increase, For example, beauty industry ads with generated image creatives achieve a 29\% higher click-through rate (CTR).},

In this study, we documented the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) learning experience of seven students from two special schools who participated in a series of game design workshops. We analysed their learning process, usage, and perspectives of text-to-image GenAI through video analysis, questionnaire, and evaluation of design outputs. Our findings reveal the students' willingness to learn and utilise AI technology. This AI experience allows students, especially those who struggle with fine motor skills, to translate their ideas into digital images. Moreover, the text-to-image interaction enhances students' ability to convey their ideas in writing and develop their skills in conceptualisation. We also summarised significant human-AI interaction challenges, including difficulties with typing, Chinese and English spelling, and prompt writing. We conclude with recommendations for designing future inclusive human-AI interaction experiences for students with SEN in China.},

We found that designers not only would fall in a dilemma when deciding whether to consider AI as a co-creative agent according to different stakeholders’ interests, but they also face many challenges in effectively co-creating with the current systems, including challenges in consistently adjusting AI outputs and getting design inspiration within the iterative generation process, etc. Based on our findings, we concluded both the epistemological and creative patterns of collaborating with generative AI and highlighted several design opportunities from both technical and ethical perspectives to better support future designer-AI co-creation.},

 abstract = {Since the launch of applications such as dall•e, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, generative artificial intelligence has been controversial as a tool for creating artwork. Some writers have presented worries about these technologies as harbingers of fully automated futures to come, but more pressing is the impact of generative AI on creative labour in the present. Already, business leaders have begun replacing human artistic labour with AI-generated images. In response, the artistic community has launched a protest movement, which argues that AI image generation is a kind of theft. This paper analyzes, substantiates, and critiques these arguments, concluding that AI image generators involve an unethical kind of labour theft. If correct, many other AI applications also rely upon theft.},

 abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are evaluated using competitive methods that rely on benchmark datasets to determine performance. These benchmark datasets, however, are often constructed through arbitrary processes that fall short in encapsulating the depth and breadth of the tasks they are intended to measure. In this paper, we interrogate the naturalization of benchmark datasets as veracious metrics by examining the historical development of benchmarking as an epistemic practice in AI research. Specifically, we highlight three key case studies that were crucial in establishing the existing reliance on benchmark datasets for evaluating the capabilities of AI systems: (1) the sharing of Highleyman’s OCR dataset in the 1960s, which solidified a community of knowledge production around a shared benchmark dataset, (2) the Common Task Framework (CTF) of the 1980s, a state-led project to standardize benchmark datasets as legitimate indicators of technical progress; and (3) the Netflix Prize which further solidified benchmarking as a competitive goal within the ML research community. This genealogy highlights how contemporary dynamics and limitations of benchmarking developed from a longer history of collaboration, standardization, and competition. We end with reflections on how this history informs our understanding of benchmarking in the current era of generative artificial intelligence.},

 abstract = {Manual verification has become very challenging based on the increasing volume of information shared online and the role of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Thus, AI systems are used to identify disinformation and deep fakes online. Previous research has shown that superior performance can be observed when combining AI and human expertise. Moreover, according to the EU AI Act, human oversight is inevitable when using AI systems in a domain where fundamental human rights, such as the right to free expression, might be affected. Thus, AI systems need to be transparent and offer sufficient explanations to be comprehensible. Much research has been done on integrating eXplainability (XAI) features to increase the transparency of AI systems; however, they lack human-centered evaluation. Additionally, the meaningfulness of explanations varies depending on users’ background knowledge and individual factors. Thus, this research implements a human-centered evaluation schema to evaluate different XAI features for the collaborative human-AI disinformation detection task. Hereby, objective and subjective evaluation dimensions, such as performance, perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust in the AI system, are used to evaluate different XAI features. A user study was conducted with an overall total of 433 participants, whereas 406 crowdworkers and 27 journalists participated as experts in detecting disinformation. The results show that free-text explanations contribute to improving non-expert performance but do not influence the performance of experts. The XAI features increase the perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust in the AI system, but they can also lead crowdworkers to blindly trust the AI system when its predictions are wrong.},

 abstract = {As generative artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more common in day-to-day life, AI-generated content (AIGC) needs to be accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. These characteristics typically are determined by subjective, human-based image quality assessment; however, there is limited research on the qualification of AI-generated image quality. Over 9,800 images were generated using Craiyon and OpenAI's DALL-E 2 text-to-image models and evaluated on the three criteria proposed for determining the quality of visual AIGC: (1) the number of objects, (2), resolution (strictly image quality; label/prompt exclusive), and (3) representativeness (consideration for how well the image matches the label/prompt). We observe that the paid, DALL-E 2 model, produced a dataset with fewer objects per image, higher resolution, and higher representativeness compared to Craiyon (free). There is an inverse relationship between the number of objects/images and its resolution and representativeness. This study establishes three subjective metrics for the evaluation of synthetic images to support the creation of more inclusive AIGC.},

The proliferation of these technologies suggests that it would be prudent to raise awareness of the potential consequences of irresponsible use of these models. Indeed, to achieve trustworthy AI solutions, it is essential to promote AI education as a fundamental step. Educating people to use AI responsibly not only improves their understanding of the technology, but also equips them to address issues of bias and discrimination. Indeed, informed users are more likely to recognize when AI is producing biased or discriminatory results and to demand appropriate solutions. This awareness of the ethical implications of AI decisions is crucial for the responsible and socially conscious adoption of AI.

While the prevalence of GenAI in education has motivated numerous research initiatives, integrating these technologies within the learning analytics (LA) cycle and their implications for practical interventions remain underexplored. This paper delves into the prospective opportunities and challenges GenAI poses for advancing LA. We present a concise overview of the current GenAI landscape and contextualise its potential roles within Clow’s generic framework of the LA cycle. We posit that GenAI can play pivotal roles in analysing unstructured data, generating synthetic learner data, enriching multimodal learner interactions, advancing interactive and explanatory analytics, and facilitating personalisation and adaptive interventions. As the lines blur between learners and GenAI tools, a renewed understanding of learners is needed. Future research can delve deep into frameworks and methodologies that advocate for human-AI collaboration. The LA community can play a pivotal role in capturing data about human and AI contributions and exploring how they can collaborate most effectively. As LA advances, it is essential to consider the pedagogical implications and broader socioeconomic impact of GenAI for ensuring an inclusive future.},

 abstract = {Ethical AI has become increasingly important, and it has been attracting attention from academia and industry, due to its increased popularity in real-world applications with fairness concerns. It also places fundamental importance on ethical considerations in determining legitimate and illegitimate uses of AI. Organizations that apply ethical AI have clearly stated well-defined review processes to ensure adherence to legal guidelines. Therefore, the wave of research at the intersection of ethical AI in data mining and machine learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and social science. Despite these successes, ethical AI still faces many challenges, such as a lack of interpretable and explainable methods for fairness-aware deep learning models, etc. Consequently, there is an urgent need to bring experts and researchers together at prestigious venues to discuss ethical AI, which has been rarely seen in previous KDD conferences. This workshop will provide a premium platform for both research and industry from different backgrounds to exchange ideas on opportunities, challenges, and cutting-edge techniques in ethical AI.},

 abstract = {The traditional evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems is generally very costly as it requires manual relevance annotation from human experts. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence -specifically large language models (LLMs)- can generate relevance annotations at an enormous scale with relatively small computational costs. Potentially, this could alleviate the costs traditionally associated with IR evaluation and make it applicable to numerous low-resource applications. However, generated relevance annotations are not immune to (systematic) errors, and as a result, directly using them for evaluation produces unreliable results.In this work, we propose two methods based on prediction-powered inference and conformal risk control that utilize computer-generated relevance annotations to place reliable confidence intervals (CIs) around IR evaluation metrics. Our proposed methods require a small number of reliable annotations from which the methods can statistically analyze the errors in the generated annotations. Using this information, we can place CIs around evaluation metrics with strong theoretical guarantees. Unlike existing approaches, our conformal risk control method is specifically designed for ranking metrics and can vary its CIs per query and document. Our experimental results show that our CIs accurately capture both the variance and bias in evaluation based on LLM annotations, better than the typical empirical bootstrapping estimates. We hope our contributions bring reliable evaluation to the many IR applications where this was traditionally infeasible.},

This progress has had a disruptive impact on the design industry, where designers are increasingly embracing generative AI images as innovative tools and techniques to enhance design ideation and creative expression. Integrating generative AI images into design education has become an inevitable trend, as it guides students in developing a deeper understanding of design aesthetics. However, the current application of generative AI images in design education lacks innovative use grounded in design theory. Therefore, the incorporation of generative AI images within the framework of design theory becomes crucial to interpret and refine design processes and design thinking. This research aims to explore the application of generative AI images in design semiotics, utilizing design theory as its foundation. By integrating design processes and incorporating design case studies, the study seeks to analyze how generative AI images can be effectively applied in design semiotics. Ultimately, the research strives to establish a pedagogical approach for the application of generative AI image-based design semiotics.},

This experience report describes reflections regarding using ChatGPT as a source of consultation in a written HCI exam in 2023. The paper describes experiences with analysis of the types of questions ChatGPT was able to solve immediately without mediation and the types of questions that could benefit from ChatGPT’s assistance without compromising the assessment of higher-level learning outcomes that professors want to analyse in teaching HCI. The paper uses Bloom’s taxonomy to analyse different questions and abilities to be evaluated and how they can be solved solely by using ChatGPT. The paper discusses questions that need mediation, previous lived experience in class and understanding of the knowledge acquired in class that cannot be answered directly by copying and pasting questions into ChatGPT. The discussions can raise reflections on the learning outcomes that can be assessed in HCI written exams and how professors should reflect upon their experiences and expectations for exams in the age of growing generative artificial intelligence resources.},

However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research.},

 abstract = {Task-oriented chatbots are increasingly used to access all sorts of services – like booking a flight, or setting a medical appointment – through natural language conversation. There are many technologies for implementing task-oriented chatbots, including Dialogflow, Watson, and Rasa. They rely on an explicit definition of the user intents, conversation flows, and chatbot outputs, which is costly to specify, and sometimes results in suboptimal user experiences and artificial conversations with limited diversity of chatbot responses. Recently, the advances in generative artificial intelligence fostered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new range of open-domain chatbots, like ChatGPT, able to converse fluently on any topic. However, they are general-purpose, and therefore not directly usable to solve specialised tasks reliably. In this paper, we study the power of LLMs to build task-oriented chatbots, resulting in lighter specifications – no intent definition required – and more natural conversations than in intent-based approaches. To this end, we propose a lightweight domain-specific language based on YAML to specify chatbots using modules of different types (e.g., menus, question-answering, data gathering). These specifications are compiled into structured LLM prompts that use the ReAct framework to inform our runtime how to interpret the user input and coordinate the tasks that the chatbot must perform. The paper presents the design and realisation of our framework, and an assessment that encodes a set of existing intent-based chatbots using our approach, showing its benefits in terms of specification size, conversation flexibility and output diversity.},

Analyzed the fault propagation law of lightweight block cipher TWINE and used differential fault analysis method to analyze TWINE. This method is based on the principle of half byte and half random fault attack, and deeply analyzes the degree of differential fault attack on TWINE through multiple rounds of fault propagation. The experimental results show that injecting a total of 4 faults in the 32nd round can fully recover the 80bit seed key, which is the best attack result so far against the differential fault attack of the TWINE algorithm.},

 abstract = {This research delves into integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI within Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to bolster fraud prevention measures. The study commences by thoroughly mapping the fraud tree taxonomy with existing ERP applications to identify areas susceptible to fraudulent activities, encompassing corruption, asset misappropriation, and financial statement fraud. The research proposes the utilisation of specific NLP and Generative AI APIs tailored to address these areas, effectively building upon these identified vulnerabilities. By establishing standardised criteria for API development, the research provides a comprehensive roadmap for the accounting and finance profession to adopt and implement these advanced technologies to combat fraud more efficiently. The suggested roadmap encompasses crucial stages, including evaluating organisational requirements, assessing API providers, seamlessly integrating APIs into ERP systems, conducting thorough testing, and establishing robust monitoring and governance mechanisms. The findings underscore the tremendous potential of NLP and Generative AI in fortifying fraud prevention endeavours within ERP systems while highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of this research, which amalgamates insights from ERP systems, fraud detection, NLP, and Generative AI. The study also encourages future empirical investigations to validate and refine the proposed solutions within real-world contexts.},

However, the process can be non-deterministic and often involves tedious trial-and-error as users struggle to formulate effective prompts to achieve their desired results. This paper describes a generative approach that empowers users to easily work with a large text-to-image (TTI) model to create their preferred painterly content. The authors propose a large model personalization method, namely Semantic Injection, to personalize a large TTI model in a given specific artistic style, i.e., Kandinsky’s paintings in Bauhaus era, as the Artist Model. Through working with a Kandinsky expert, the authors first establish a semantic descriptive guideline and a TTI dataset of Kandinsky style and then apply the Semantic Injection method to obtain an Artist Model of Kandinsky, empowering users to create preferred Kandinsky content in a deterministically controllable manner.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have shown incredible promise for zero shot image-to-image translation and editing. Most of these approaches work by combining or replacing network-specific features used in the generation of new images with those taken from the inversion of some guide image. Methods of this type are considered the current state-of-the-art in training-free approaches, but have some notable limitations: they tend to be costly in runtime and memory, and often depend on deterministic sampling that limits variation in generated results. We propose Filter-Guided Diffusion (FGD), an alternative approach that leverages fast filtering operations during the diffusion process to support finer control over the strength and frequencies of guidance and can work with non-deterministic samplers to produce greater variety. With its efficiency, FGD can be sampled over multiple seeds and hyperparameters in less time than a single run of other SOTA methods to produce superior results based on structural and semantic metrics. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments to evaluate the performance of FGD in translation tasks and also demonstrate its potential in localized editing when used with masks.},

Computer science student perceptions and behaviors towards GenAI tools have been studied, but the effects of such tools on student learning have yet to be determined conclusively. We investigate the impact of GenAI tools on computing students' performance in a database course and aim to understand why students use GenAI tools in assignments. Our mixed-methods study (N=226) asked students to self-report whether they used a GenAI tool to complete a part of an assignment and why. Our results reveal that students utilizing GenAI tools performed better on the assignment part in which LLMs were permitted but did worse in other parts of the assignment and in the course overall. Also, those who did not use GenAI tools viewed more discussion board posts and participated more than those who used ChatGPT. This suggests that using GenAI tools may not lead to better skill development or mental models, at least not if the use of such tools is unsupervised, and that engagement with official course help supports may be affected. Further, our thematic analysis of reasons for using or not using GenAI tools, helps understand why students are drawn to these tools. Shedding light into such aspects empowers instructors to be proactive in how to encourage, supervise, and handle the use or integration of GenAI into courses, fostering good learning habits.},

Code interviews (1) pushed students to discuss their work, motivating more nuanced but sometimes repetitive insights; (2) enabled peer learning, reducing stress in some ways but increasing stress in other ways; (3) scaled with TA-led sections, replacing familiar practice with an unfamiliar assessment; (4) focused on student contributions, limiting opportunities for TAs to give guidance and feedback.

To aid in this effort, we designed an open-ended generative AI project for the freshmen taking our general-education introduction to computing course. Students were required to team with generative AI to create something beyond what they alone (or the AI alone) could accomplish. Upon completion, students submitted a short written critical analysis documenting their experiences and presented a three-minute demonstration of their project in class. Despite limited course coverage of AI and generative AI prior to this project, we were impressed by the creativity and sophistication of the submitted final products as well as the breadth of generative AI tools explored. Student reflections on the experience illustrated numerous insights into the strengths and limitations of the tools they employed. Our results underscore that students can learn about the benefits and limitations of generative AI in as little as a single assignment and that covering such topics need not require extensive amounts of course time and resources.},

 abstract = {While educational researchers in various disciplines are grappling with how to develop policies and pedagogical approaches that address the use of generative artificial intelligence, the challenge is particularly complex in computer science education where the new technology is changing the core of the field. In this paper, we take a look at the pedagogy of other subjects with a longer history than computer science and a more extensive body of educational research to collect insights on how this challenge can be met. We begin by drawing from recent neurological research to find domains that share cognitive commonalities with computer programming and then build upon comparisons that others have made to literacy and mathematics education. We then consider how the "reading wars" and "math wars" have shaped these fields, which we see as conflicts between less effective top-down pedagogy and more effective bottom-up pedagogy, and reflect on what would be comparable approaches in teaching computing. We find that approaches that make heavy use of large language models without teaching fundamentals can be compared to the top-down pedagogy of reading and mathematics and are likely to be ineffective on their own. Therefore, we advise against the exclusive use of such approaches with novices. However, we also acknowledge that the social science surrounding computer science education is complex and that effectiveness only tells a part of the story, with other factors such as engagement, motivation and social dynamics also being important.},

 abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is transforming Computer Science education, and every instructor is reflecting on how AI will impact their courses. Instructors must determine how students may use AI for course activities and what AI systems they will support and encourage students to use. This task is challenging with the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and related AI systems. The contribution of this work is an experimental evaluation of the performance of multiple open-source and commercial LLMs utilizing retrieval-augmented generation in answering questions for computer science courses and a cost-benefit analysis for instructors when determining what systems to use. A key factor is the time an instructor has to maintain their supported AI systems and the most effective activities for improving their performance. The paper offers recommendations for deploying, using, and enhancing AI in educational settings.},

 abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners. It is frequently used to address major security problems such as supply chain attacks, ransomware threats, and social engineering. In this context, integrating AI into cybersecurity workflows requires incorporating AI-driven approaches into the educational training of the cybersecurity workforce. This paradigm shift in academic settings will introduce the necessary skills for cybersecurity professionals to operate modern AI-based systems. Yet, the current cybersecurity curriculum still suffers from the absence of AI resources, particularly the detailed understanding of the appropriate AI mechanisms. Such absence leaves skill gaps for future professionals and practitioners in the industry. To address this, we designed an academic lecture module on AI covering both theory and practice. Then, we taught the module across six cybersecurity courses in our institution. To assess the effectiveness of integrating AI materials into cybersecurity education, we collected data by presenting two surveys before and after the lecture (concluding 81 participants per survey). Specifically, we utilized widely accepted models for unbiased analysis of our data. Our experimental results show positive AI knowledge improvement by 30\% of the participants, demonstrating the beneficial impact of the lecture. Then, we observed a high similarity score between the survey responses and the lecture content, reaching 84\%. Moreover, our sentiment analysis results reflect positive feedback from the participants with a positive score of 0.50. Overall, our study serves as a reference for instructional designers for developing educational curricula aiming to integrate AI into cybersecurity education.},

From our experience in CS50, Harvard University's introductory course, we've seen firsthand the impactful role that generative artificial intelligence can play in education. Recognizing its potential and stakes, we integrated OpenAI's GPT into our own teaching methodology. The goal was to emulate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio, incorporating "pedagogical guardrails" to maintain instructional integrity. The result was a personalized, AI-powered bot in the form of a friendly rubber duck aimed at delivering instructional responses and troubleshooting without giving outright solutions. In this tutorial, we share our journey and offer insights into responsibly harnessing AI in educational settings. Participants will gain hands-on experience working with GPT through OpenAI's latest APIs, understanding and crafting prompts, answering questions using embedding-based search, and finally, collaboratively building their own AI chatbot. Ultimately, we'll not only share lessons learned from our own approach but also equip educators hands-on with the knowledge and tools with which they, too, can implement these technologies in their unique teaching environments.},

 abstract = {Recent advancements in large language model-based generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have transformed computer science education, presenting both opportunities and challenges. A study investigating students' attitudes toward these tools was conducted during an Introduction to Computer Science course. The target of the study was to gauge students' evolving attitudes toward using GenAI tools in the course, before, during and after ChatGPT was gradually assimilated into homework assignments. The study refers to three phases: preliminary phase, assimilation phase, and calibration stage, which currently takes place. Findings show that, in the preliminary phase, students appreciated the efficiency of GenAI tools offered but were concerned about developing a dependency on these tools and about ''cheating''. Findings from the assimilation phase indicate that consistent, guided exposure to GenAI tools positively shifted students' views, alleviating initial concerns and promoting a positive attitude toward using GenAI tools in the course. The targets of the calibration phase are: a) to examine how to leverage independent learning by formulating clear guidelines that can build trust in the technology and help overcome concerns regarding reliability and credibility; b) to check how GenAI can help students in a Introduction to Computer Science course acquire skills such as critical thinking and code comprehension. The study offers insights for educators on the integration of GenAI tools into computer science courses to enhance learning while maintaining academic integrity.},

 abstract = {Most of the attention on GenAI in computing education has focused on programming-centric tasks, such as code generation, giving feedback on code, or providing synthetic programming partners. Yet in advanced software engineering and project courses, interpersonal skills such as team meetings or customer interviews are equally important but difficult and instructor-intensive to teach realistically. GenAI presents the possibility of scaffolding the teaching of some of these practices by enabling exercises in which students develop the ability to investigate a topic by iteratively asking questions to find a solution. The goal is to create scenarios in which students train to interact with humans in real-world situations, simulating these interactions in a controlled, guided environment. These simulations could help students practice and refine ''soft skills,'' such as teamwork and interviewing, by mimicking the types of exchanges and problem-solving they would encounter in professional environments. This approach allows learners to engage in realistic communication exercises, improving their ability to handle complex, interpersonal tasks through repeated practice with AI-guided feedback. As an example, we envision examples that include requirements elicitation with customers, development team meetings, and discussion with potential investors, to name just a few.},

 abstract = {The release of popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT have prompted universities to introduce new policies or update existing ones. Currently, most institutions adapt their policies reactively as challenges arise, often without adopting a systematic framework, with minimal guidance and limited knowledge of the approaches taken by other institutions across the United States (U.S.). This study aims to bridge this gap by identifying core themes surrounding AI policies and guidelines across the top 50 U.S. universities. Given the labor- and time-intensive nature required to manually synthesize multiple policy documents across many institutions, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to identify common and prevalent themes. Our framework first summarizes AI policies at the institutional level, followed by the generation of multiple sets of themes through an iterative process of prompt chaining and self-refinement. Finally, the common themes from these distinct sets were consolidated. This framework is designed to address potential flaws in pre-trained LLMs, such as hallucinations. Seven distinct themes are uncovered: (1) academic integrity and responsible AI use, (2) communication of AI policies, (3) data privacy and security concerns, (4) ethical considerations in AI use, (5) continuous adaptation and policy evolution, (6) documentation and transparency in AI usage, and (7) instructor discretion in AI integration. Our work lays the foundation for future analyses or recommendations in developing comprehensive and equitable AI policies. Furthermore, leveraging LLMs allows us to respond swiftly to developments surrounding AI policies across universities.},

In this work, we introduce our strategy for configuring an LLM to serve as a ''rubber duck debugging'' coding assistant to help novice programmers when they encounter difficulties in programming assignments. The key contribution of this work is not in the idea of using LLMs for debugging itself (which has already been demonstrated elsewhere, e.g., [3]) but to demonstrate the ease, flexibility, and pedagogical potential of the strategy. In particular, through carefully crafted prompts and easily accessible platforms, rubber duck LLMs can assist learners with specific questions while also situating those questions alongside larger computer science concepts and computational thinking practices. This work contributes an easily replicated and model-agnostic instructional strategy that productively and responsibly leverages the power of LLMs to assist novice programmers in developing foundational programming skills.},

This method is currently in its third semester as a part of an ongoing, iterative, semi-experimental approach to support student resilience in entrance-level courses. This approach aimed to enhance student engagement, retention, and performance by integrating weekly practice sessions and "group-tutoring" sessions facilitated by peer learning assistants. In these sessions, students were encouraged to articulate their problem-solving strategies and the reasoning behind their solutions, fostering a deeper understanding of programming language paradigms and problem-solving techniques.The findings indicate that this method significantly increased classroom engagement, as students became more active participants in their learning journey. Retention rates improved as students became more confident in understanding and applying programming concepts. Overall, student performance saw a notable rise, with students demonstrating a better grasp of programming paradigms and problem-solving approaches beyond rote memorization and matching sample outputs.},

 abstract = {The rapidly increasing amount of online information and the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) make the manual verification of information impractical. Consequently, AI systems are deployed to detect disinformation and deepfakes. Prior studies have indicated that combining AI and human capabilities yields enhanced performance in detecting disinformation. Furthermore, the European Union (EU) AI Act mandates human supervision for AI applications in areas impacting essential human rights, like freedom of speech, necessitating that AI systems be transparent and provide adequate explanations to ensure comprehensibility. Extensive research has been conducted on incorporating explainability (XAI) attributes to augment AI transparency, yet these often miss a human-centric assessment. The effectiveness of such explanations also varies with the user’s prior knowledge and personal attributes. Therefore, we developed a framework for validating XAI features for the collaborative human-AI fact-checking task. The framework allows the testing of XAI features with objective and subjective evaluation dimensions and follows human-centric design principles when displaying information about the AI system to the users. The framework was tested in a crowdsourcing experiment with 433 participants, including 406 crowdworkers and 27 journalists for the collaborative disinformation detection task. The tested XAI features increase the AI system’s perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust. With this publication, the XAI evaluation framework is made open source.},

 abstract = {User Experience (UX) practitioners, like UX designers and researchers, have begun to adopt Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools into their work practices. However, we lack an understanding of how UX practitioners, UX teams, and companies actually utilize GenAI and what challenges they face. We conducted interviews with 24 UX practitioners from multiple companies and countries, with varying roles and seniority. Our findings include: 1) There is a significant lack of GenAI company policies, with companies informally advising caution or leaving the responsibility to individual employees; 2) UX teams lack team-wide GenAI practices. UX practitioners typically use GenAI individually, favoring writing-based tasks, but note limitations for design-focused activities, like wireframing and prototyping; 3) UX practitioners call for better training on GenAI to enhance their abilities to generate effective prompts and evaluate output quality. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for GenAI integration in the UX sector.},

 abstract = {The continuous advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) enable designers to efficiently obtain vast amounts of inspirational materials during the design conception phase. Various modalities of stimuli can impact designers’ creativity. However, the relationship between the sequence of different modalities (Text, Images, and Virtual Models) and creativity remains to be explored. In this study, we investigate the effects of 6 sequential combinations of 3 modalities on designers’ creativity. Designers (N=36) used the creative stimulation platform InspireMe, accessing inspirational stimuli in various sequences to execute their design tasks. We analyzed the impact on creativity through assessments of work innovation and user interviews. The findings indicate that the sequence of material combinations significantly influences designers’ creativity, with varying impacts on the different sub-attributes of creativity. Drawing on experimental findings and qualitative research, this paper introduces a creativity demand-matching inspirational stimulation interaction strategy—the CDI strategy—that assists designers in developing more targeted design solutions. Furthermore, we propose the 3C Framework, a design strategy for creativity stimulation platforms aimed at designers in the intelligent era. This framework aims to guide the development of creative stimulation platforms for designers in the intelligent era.},

In this context, we explore AI as a tool that mediates cultural understanding and remediates human values – that are often influenced by biases and inequities. Using participatory design for learning with a group of 13 children (ages 8-13), we engaged in five co-design sessions featuring different modalities for socio-cultural approaches to AI literacy. We found that children were more aware of the cultural mediation aspect of AI when the content of the interaction aligned with their cultural background and context. This underscored the significance of aligning the representation of culture in these GenAI systems with people’s socio-cultural ecosystems in modern technological literacies. We conclude with design principles for a more critical and holistic approach to AI literacy.},

This paper investigates faculty members' perceptions of using artificial intelligence, chatbots, and generative AI in teaching and learning in Uzbeki's higher education contexts. The researchers employed a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to collect the data. Purposeful sampling was employed to select participants in this study, and the interviews were conducted face-to-face at the university campus. The study's underlying theory is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, including effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, which were employed as a lens to direct the research. The data were transcribed and analyzed using the deductive approach for the thematic analysis. The findings revealed that lecturers have a positive attitude to adopt and use AI for content creation, assessment and feedback, and doing research in their institution. Some instructors may see it as a valuable tool for generating creative content and aiding student learning. In contrast, others may have concerns about its potential to replace human creativity or biases in generated materials. Lecturers also view AI as a technology to achieve accessibility and equity after overcoming the challenges. Findings revealed that some measurements should be taken about the facilitating conditions and the perceived risks of using AI.},

 abstract = {Engineering process management aims to formally specify processes which are executable, measurable, and controllable. Common representations include text-based domain-specific languages (DSLs) or graphical notations such as the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN). The specification itself can be seen as a Software Product Line (SPL), building upon concepts such as tasks, UI forms, fields and actions. Domain experts provide requirements for processes but often lack the technical programming skills to formalize them in a process specification language. We present an interactive SPL application prototype that allows domain experts to model simple processes in natural language. Our framework for the reliable generation of formal specifications with Large Language Models (LLMs) supports the machine-translation from natural language to a JSON-based process DSL. In this case study, five domain experts were asked to model any process of their choice through natural-language interactions. As a result, the user interface corresponding to the process DSL was shown as immediate feedback. We documented their perceived translation quality and interviewed them on their impressions of this methodology. An average user-assessed performance rating of 68\% was achieved. Even though the modelling strategies differed greatly between individuals, the tool was able to adequately capture the majority of instructions, leaving an overall positive impression on the participants. More context awareness and additional conventional interaction elements were the main aspects found to be improved for a productive implementation.},

The nature of different families and classes of malware images is imbalanced, which leads to a challenging issue of biased classification, where the majority classes dominate the model's performance. Attention is drawn to generative artificial intelligence, in which a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to synthesize more training samples (particularly in minority classes). A more balanced dataset can reduce biased classification towards the majority class. However, a robust GAN model usually requires high computing power and a lot of epochs. In this paper, we aim to design a lightweight GAN model to enhance the performance of malware image classification in imbalanced datasets.

 abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, have performed interestingly well when assisting developers on computer programming tasks, a.k.a., coding, thus potentially resulting in convenient and faster software constructions. This new approach significantly enhances efficiency but also presents challenges in unsupervised code construction with limited security guarantees. LLMs excel in producing code with accurate grammar, yet they are not specifically trained to guarantee the security of the code. In this paper, we provide an initial exploration into using formal software specifications as a starting point for software construction, allowing developers to translate descriptions of security-related behavior into natural language instructions for LLMs, a.k.a., prompts. In addition, we leveraged automated verification tools to evaluate the code produced against the aforementioned specifications , following a modular, step-by-step software construction process. For our study, we leveraged Role-based Access Control (RBAC), a mature security model, and the Java Modeling Language (JML), a behavioral specification language for Java. We test our approach on different publicly-available LLMs, namely, OpenAI ChatGPT 4.0, Google Bard, and Microsoft CoPilot. We provide a description of two applications-a security-sensitive Banking application employing RBAC and an RBAC API module itself-, the corresponding JML specifications, as well as a description of the prompts, the generated code, the verification results, as well as a series of interesting insights for practitioners interested in further exploring the use of LLMs for securely constructing applications.},

 abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are being applied to numerous applications from Healthcare to Cyber Security to Finance. For example, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are being applied to solve security problems such as malware analysis and insider threat detection. However, there are many challenges in applying ML algorithms for various applications. For example, (i) the ML algorithms may violate the privacy of individuals. This is because we can gather massive amounts of data and apply ML algorithms to the data to extract highly sensitive information. (ii) ML algorithms may show bias and be unfair to various segments of the population. (iii) ML algorithms themselves may be attacked possibly resulting in catastrophic errors including in cyber-physical systems such as transportation systems. Finally, (iv) the ML algorithms must be safe and not harm society. Therefore, when ML algorithms are applied to transportation systems for handling congestion, preventing accidents, and giving advice to drivers, we must ensure that they are secure, ensure privacy and fairness, as well as provide for the safe operation of the transportation systems. Other AY techniques such as Generative AI (GenAI) are also being applied not only to secure systems design but also to determine the attacks and potential solutions. This presentation is divided into two parts. First, we describe our research over the past decade on Trustworthy ML systems. These are systems that are secure as well as ensure privacy, fairness, and safety. We discuss our ensemble-based ML models for detecting attacks as well as our research on developing Adversarial Machine Learning techniques. We also discuss securing the Internet of Transportation systems that are based on traditional methods such as Extended Kalman Filters to detect cyberattacks. Second, Second, we discuss our work on Finally, we discuss the research we recently started as part of the USDOT National University Technology Center TraCR (Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency) led by Clemson University. In particular, we describe (i) the application of federated machine learning techniques for detecting attacks in transportation systems; (ii) publishing synthetic transportation data sets that preserve privacy, (iii) fairness algorithms for transportation systems, and (iv) examining how GenAI systems are being integrated with transportation systems to provide security. Our focus includes the following: · Data Privacy: We are designing a Privacy-aware Policy-based Data Management Framework for Transportation Systems. Our work involves collecting the requisite data and developing analysis tools to identify and quantify privacy risks. Existing privacy-preserving, differentially private synthetic data generation techniques, which tailor data utility for generic ML accuracy, are not well suited for specific applications. We are developing synthetic data generation tools for transportation systems applications. We will develop new ML algorithms that can leverage these datasets. · Fairness: We have developed a novel adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning algorithm, FairSAOML, which adapts to changing environments in both bias control and model precision. Our current work is focusing on adapting our framework to fairness in transportation systems. and control bias over time, especially ensuring group fairness across different protected sub-populations; identifying interesting attributes using explainable AI techniques that might help to mitigate bias and develop equitable algorithms. We have also developed a second system, FairDolce, that recognizes objects involving fairness constraints in a changing environment. We are adapting it to transportation applications. For example, pedestrian detection (whether or not the object being seen is a pedestrian) must be fair with respect to the race or gender of the individuals being detected under changing environments (e.g., rainy, cloudy sunny). Adversarial ML: Our prior work on adversarial ML models worked on traditional datasets such as network traffic data. Our current focus is on adapting our approach to AV-based sensor data. Our ML models are being applied to sensor data for object recognition and traffic management. These ML models may be attacked by the adversary. We will study various attack models and investigate ways of how interactions may occur between the model and the adversary and subsequently develop appropriate adversarial ML models that operate on the AV sensor data. · Attack Detection - Smart vehicles are often exposed to various attacks making it difficult for manufacturers to collaboratively train anomaly/attack detection models. Yet it would be ideal if all the data available across manufacturers could be used in building robust attack detection systems. To achieve this, we developed FAST-SV, which incorporates federated learning in conjunction with augmentation techniques to build a highly performant attack detection system for smart cars. Safety: Safety has been studied for cyber-physical systems and formal methods have been applied to specify safety properties and subsequently verify that the system satisfies the specifications. However, our goal is to ensure that the ML algorithms utilized by the transportation systems are safe. This would involve developing an AI Governance framework that would require transparency and explainability (among others) of the ML algorithms utilized by the transportation system.},

 abstract = {Navigation aids such as headers and internal links provide vital support for screen-reader users on web documents to grasp a document’s structure. However, when such navigation aids are unavailable or not appropriately marked up, this situation can cause serious difficulties. This article presents the design and evaluation of a tool for automatically generating navigation aids with headers and internal links for screen readers with topicalisation and labelling algorithms. The proposed tool uses natural language processing techniques to divide a web document into topic segments and label each segment in two cycles based on its content. We conducted an initial user study in the first cycle with eight blind and partially-sighted screen reader users. The evaluation involved tasks with questions answered by participants with information from texts with and without automatically generated headers. The results in the first cycle provided preliminary indicators of performance improvement and cognitive load reduction. The second cycle involved co-designing an improved version with two blind experts in web accessibility, resulting in a browser extension which injects automatically generated headers and in-page navigation with internal links, along with improvements in the generation of labels using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The browser extension was evaluated by seven blind participants using the same four texts used to evaluate the preliminary prototype developed in the first cycle. With the two development cycles, the study provided important insights into the design of navigation aids for screen-reader users using natural language processing techniques, including the potential use of generative artificial intelligence for assistive technologies and limitations that need to be explored in future research.},

 abstract = {Trustworthy artificial intelligence (Trusted AI) is of utmost importance when learning-enabled components (LECs) are used in autonomous, safety-critical systems. When reliant on deep learning, these systems need to address the reliability, robustness, and interpretability of learning models. In addition to developing strategies to address these concerns, appropriate software architectures are needed to coordinate LECs and ensure they deliver acceptable behavior even under uncertain conditions. This work describes Anunnaki, a model-driven framework comprising loosely-coupled modular services designed to monitor and manage LECs with respect to Trusted AI assurance concerns when faced with different sources of uncertainty. More specifically, the Anunnaki framework supports the composition of independent, modular services to assess and improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems. The design of Annunaki was guided by several key software engineering principles (e.g., modularity, composability, and reusability) in order to facilitate its use and maintenance to support different aggregate monitoring and assurance analysis tools for LESs and their respective data sets. We demonstrate Anunnaki on two autonomous platforms, a terrestrial rover, and an unmanned aerial vehicle. Our studies show how Anunnaki can be used to manage the operations of different autonomous learning-enabled systems with vision-based LECs while exposed to uncertain environmental conditions.},

 abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence systems based on transformers, including both text generators such as GPT-4 and image generators such as DALL-E 3, have recently entered the popular consciousness. These tools, while impressive, are liable to reproduce, exacerbate, and reinforce extant human social biases, such as gender and racial biases. In this article, we systematically review the extent to which DALL-E Mini suffers from this problem. In line with the Model Card published alongside DALL-E Mini by its creators, we find that the images it produces tend to represent dozens of different occupations as populated either solely by men (e.g., pilot, builder, plumber) or solely by women (e.g., hairdresser, receptionist, dietitian). In addition, the images DALL-E Mini produces tend to represent most occupations as populated primarily or solely by White people (e.g., farmer, painter, prison officer, software engineer) and very few by non-White people (e.g., pastor, rapper). These findings suggest that exciting new AI technologies should be critically scrutinized and perhaps regulated before they are unleashed on society.},

 abstract = {This article aimed to address the problems of word order confusion, context dependency, and ambiguity in traditional machine translation (MT) methods for verb recognition. By applying advanced intelligent algorithms of artificial intelligence, verb recognition can be better processed and the quality and accuracy of MT can be improved. Based on Neural machine translation (NMT), basic attention mechanisms, historical attention information, dynamically obtain information related to the generated words, and constraint mechanisms were introduced to embed semantic information, represent polysemy, and annotate semantic roles of verbs. This article used the Workshop on MT (WMT), British National Corpus (BNC), Gutenberg, Reuters Corpus, and OpenSubtitles corpus, and enhanced the data in the corpora. The improved NMT model was compared with traditional NMT models, Rule-Based MT (RBMT), and Statistical MT (SMT). The experimental results showed that the average verb semantic matching degree of the improved NMT model in five corpora was 0.85, and the average Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score in five corpora was 0.90. The improved NMT model in this article can effectively improve the accuracy of verb recognition in MT, providing new methods for verb recognition in MT.},

 abstract = {The global ultra-wide display market is growing rapidly due to widespread consumer adoption. However, existing content, especially on TV screens, is mainly designed for lower aspect ratios like 4:3. As TVs shift towards wider formats, there’s a need to develop a method to transform legacy content and adapt to varying screen sizes. This shift holds the potential to revolutionize the content viewing experience for gamers, content creators, and streaming enthusiasts. While delivering high-quality visual content for dynamic aspect ratios remains a challenge, recent advancements in Deep Learning show promise in addressing these problems with generative approaches. Our contribution begins with a survey of prior video completion efforts, providing a foundational backdrop. We then introduce our novel solution, combining optical flow methodologies with generative latent diffusion models. These models, conditioned on an initial prompt and evolving video frame, refine content generation. We validate our approach on the DAVIS dataset, demonstrating its efficacy and robustness. In summary, our study pioneers advancements in content generation for ultra-wide displays.},

 abstract = {Technological intervention to support care areas that some people may not have access to is of paramount importance to promote sustainable development of good health and wellbeing. This study aims to explore the linguistic similarities and differences between human professionals and Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) conversational agents in therapeutic dialogues. Initially, the MISTRAL-7B Large Language Model (LLM) is instructed to generate responses to patient queries to form a synthetic equivalent to a publicly available psychology dataset. A large set of linguistic features (e.g., text metrics, lexical diversity and richness, readability scores, sentiment, emotions, and named entities) is extracted and studied from both the expert and synthetically-generated text. The results suggest a significantly richer vocabulary in humans than the LLM approach. Similarly, the use of sentiment was significantly different between the two, suggesting a difference in the supportive or objective language used and that synthetic linguistic expressions of emotion may differ from those expressed by an intelligent being. However, no statistical significance was observed between human professionals and AI in the use of function words, pronouns and several named entities; possibly reflecting an increased proficiency of LLMs in modelling some language patterns, even in a specialised context (i.e., therapy). However, current findings do not support the similarity in sentimental nuance and emotional expression, which limits the effectiveness of contemporary LLMs as standalone agents. Further development is needed towards clinically validated algorithms.},

We applied a convergent mixed-methods approach to offer a comprehensive understanding of AI adoption dynamics. We initially conducted a questionnaire survey with 100 software engineers, drawing upon the Technology Acceptance Model, the Diffusion of Innovation Theory, and the Social Cognitive Theory as guiding theoretical frameworks. Employing the Gioia methodology, we derived a theoretical model of AI adoption in software engineering: the Human-AI Collaboration and Adaptation Framework. This model was then validated using Partial Least Squares–Structural Equation Modeling based on data from 183 software engineers. Findings indicate that at this early stage of AI integration, the compatibility of AI tools within existing development workflows predominantly drives their adoption, challenging conventional technology acceptance theories. The impact of perceived usefulness, social factors, and personal innovativeness seems less pronounced than expected. The study provides crucial insights for future AI tool design and offers a framework for developing effective organizational implementation strategies.},

 abstract = {Attack-defense trees, an extension of attack trees, are extensively used by security engineers to document potential countermeasures for security threats present in a system's design. These trees help integrate initial system models with countermeasures, allowing for early testing of their efficiency and impact in the design cycle. Despite advancements in automating attack tree construction, selecting the initial set of countermeasures for conversion into an attack-defense tree remains largely manual. This paper proposes an approach and a tool that extends the TTool-AI attack tree generation feature by leveraging large language models and natural language processing to create a set of countermeasures and generate attack-defense trees based on an input attack tree. To evaluate our contribution, our approach is tested using attack-defense trees generated from attack trees, each representing possible threats to an associated system specification. In addition, we introduce metrics to assess the semantic correctness and completeness of the generated attack-defense trees. We compared, using our metrics, the attack-defense trees created from our methodology to those created by an engineer and found that attack-defense trees created using AI and secondary mitigation data provided better trees than solely using AI. We also discovered that this approach generated trees that were comparable to the quality of attack-defense trees generated from a security engineer at the associate level. From these results, we believe that our contribution could aid engineers in identifying not only appropriate countermeasures for attack trees but also the optimal number of countermeasures, avoiding the complexity of redundant mitigations. Furthermore, our approach complements standard modeling practices, particularly during the initial design phase, reducing the need for time-consuming re-engineering throughout the system's lifecycle.},

 abstract = {The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has brought many conveniences to people, and at the same time has had a huge impact on the traditional education model. Interactive learning platforms have become mainstream in the context of the big data era. This article takes an online course in a university as an example to explore user interest points, demand characteristics and knowledge acquisition rules in an artificial intelligence system environment. After processing and analyzing students' browsing behavior in different scenarios, the corresponding results are returned to the database to better grasp the user's preference information and provide more services for teaching. At the same time, through the application of machine intelligence algorithms and AI technology, the personalized recommendation capabilities of the learning platform can be improved to meet students' personalized learning needs. This article tests the algorithm of the system. The test results show that the content-based recommendation algorithm performs medium to high in accuracy, but its coverage is low and is not affected by data sparsity. The collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm performs generally highest in terms of accuracy and coverage, with an accuracy rate of 96\%, and is sensitive to sparse data. The hybrid recommendation algorithm has high accuracy and coverage, and factors such as data sparsity have a medium to high impact on it. Recommendation algorithms based on deep learning show high levels of accuracy and coverage, and their impact on factors such as data sparsity is also moderate to high. However, although artificial intelligence technology has broad prospects for application in the field of education, it also faces some challenges, such as privacy protection and compliance with data use. Therefore, in the process of promoting and applying artificial intelligence technology, it is necessary to strengthen compliance with relevant laws and regulations to ensure that students' information security and privacy rights are effectively protected.},

 abstract = {The rise in capability and ubiquity of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has enabled its application to the field of Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs). Despite significant interest in leveraging modern AI-powered components in real-time SIA research, substantial friction remains due to the absence of a standardized and universal SIA framework. As such, we developed Estuary: a multimodal (text, audio, and soon video) framework which facilitates the development of low-latency, real-time SIAs. Estuary seeks to reduce repeat work between studies and to provide a flexible platform that can be run entirely off-cloud to maximize configurability, controllability, reproducibility of studies, and speed of agent response times. We achieve this by constructing a robust multimodal framework which incorporates current and future components seamlessly into a modular and interoperable architecture.},

 abstract = {Abstract: At present, Artificial intelligence technology is extensively applied across diverse sectors of the social economy and daily life. Firstly, this study introduces the current research status and relevant theoretical basis at home and abroad. Secondly, this study analyzes and summarizes the key problems and optimization goals that need to be solved in intelligent evolutionary game theory. Finally, this study improves the genetic algorithm by constructing models of different levels, and designs a comprehensive iterative cross-validation strategy combined with genetic operators to achieve the optimal control effect of the final performance index. The results show that by optimizing the intelligent algorithm, the bit error rate of the system is reduced from 0.001 to 1e-25, which greatly reduces the possibility of data corruption. Moreover, the packet loss rate decreases with the increase of distance. The result of a packet loss rate of 0.0001 makes the wireless signal more stable in data transmission. It can be seen that the application of intelligent algorithms not only improves the performance of the system, but also improves the reliability of data transmission. This can improve the stability of the communication system in complex environments, and provide users with better, more secure and reliable experience and convenience services.},

This paper focuses on the role and advantages of edge computing in 5G communication, the application of artificial intelligence combined with edge computing in 5G communication, and the realization of edge AI technology architecture. Finally, two sets of simulation results are as follows: The average accuracy error of the optimized edge AI model and cloud AI model is less than 1\%, and the average response time is reduced by 31.9ms.

This model extracts and fuses text features through attention mechanism, and achieves deep training of the neural network through skip links, making the neural network have better performance. The results showed that the performance of the TMMCJL model was outstanding, with the fastest convergence speed and the best convergence effect. In the experiment of processing 50 to 400 segments of text, the average accuracy of the TMMCJL was 86.5\%, and the F1 score reached 87.5, surpassing the accuracy of the BERT wwm model at 77.9\% and 76.2 F1 scores, as well as the Roberta model at 81.5\% and 85.6 F1 scores. These data clearly demonstrate the significant advantages of the TMMCJL model in terms of accuracy and F1 score.

By utilizing concise text prompts, Stable Diffusion is capable of producing images that are either strikingly realistic or visually stunning, bridging the gap between textual descriptions and visual representations. A notable challenge associated with Stable Diffusion is the retrieval of corresponding prompts from generated images. To tackle this challenge, we employed a strategy that leverages the capabilities of the ConvNeXt model within the OpenCLIP framework. Having trained the model on an extensive dataset of nearly 2.1 million Stable Diffusion generated images, we then subjected our approach to the evaluation of the Kaggle Stable Diffusion - Image to Prompts competition. The effectiveness of our methodology is underscored by a mean cosine similarity score of 0.63032 between the predicted and actual prompt embedding vectors on the private test set, securing a silver medal position. This achievement not only attests to the robustness of our approach but also signifies its potential in diverse sectors where the retrieval of text from images is of great importance.},

Specifically, I focus on researching ways that AI-assisted creative tools could be designed to lift the expression ceiling and reduce effort for blind and low vision creators. Starting with a formative mixed-method study that uncovers the blind and low vision community's needs for visual content creation and editing support, this dissertation explores and designs accessible content creation support for three highly desired visual creative tasks: (1) private visual content obfuscation, (2) social media video editing, and (3) aesthetic visual content authoring.

 abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence is widely used for various tasks such as language translation and art creation. Generative inference employs the key and value tensors to encode relational information among the tokens in the input and output sequences. Most of the existing generative inference frameworks use KV caching (KVC), which caches the key and value tensors (i.e., the KV cache) to avoid recomputing the key and value tensors for each of the processed tokens. Despite the widespread use of KVC, in-depth characterization of KVC with tensor offloading, which enables generative inference with a single GPU, remains yet to be explored. To bridge this gap, this work presents an in-depth characterization study of KVC, which demonstrates that KVC makes a sub-optimal trade-off between computations and communications in the context of generative inference with tensor offloading. Guided by the characterization results, we propose a novel caching technique called activation sequence caching (ASC) for high-throughput and memory-efficient generative inference with a single GPU. ASC is designed to significantly reduce the memory usage and communication overheads of generative inference at the cost of the increased computational complexity. We provide an analytical analysis of the three caching techniques (i.e., zero caching, KVC, and ASC) for generative inference in terms of the memory usage, communication overheads, and computational complexity. Our quantitative evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of ASC in that ASC significantly (e.g., 78.3\% higher throughput) outperforms a state-of-the-art generative inference framework (i.e., FlexGen) that implements KVC across various model sizes, input and output sequence lengths, and GPUs.},

We use data collected from interviews with immigrants discussing the Puente Hills Landfill Park design in Los Angeles, which will re-purpose a former landfill into a new public park. We use Dream Studio as a Design Probe, generating images from the interviewees’ insights and critically reflecting on the design process through internal interviews and a reflective workshop. We analyze our case in three domains: Opportunities, Risks and Challenges, and Features and Requirements. In the opportunities domain, we discuss how the enhanced translation of words to images changes the relationship between stakeholder engagement, multiplicity, and efficiency. In the risks and challenges domain, we discuss how IGAI might enhance power imbalances and biases.

 abstract = {Voting advice applications (VAAs) are pivotal web-based tools that guide citizens to align with political parties and candidates that match their preferences. Traditional methods for creating candidate profiles predominantly rely on questionnaire responses, a time-intensive and costly process. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-centric methodology utilizing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), culminating in creating political avatars. These political avatars are engineered using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 and Bard. They are adept at processing and interpreting data primarily sourced from Twitter and leveraging bespoke, self-trained datasets. Integrating advanced AI technology with diverse data sources equips political avatars with unprecedented analytical and predictive capabilities, setting a new standard in political analysis. Unlike traditional methods, political avatars are adept at emulating the responses of real politicians or experts, showcasing a remarkable capacity to interact with VAA surveys. This novel approach presents the potential to either compete with or enhance the insights traditionally obtained from human experts. Another critical aspect of our study is comparing political avatars and previous research employing question-answering (QA) models based on advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for political profiling. This comparative analysis reveals that Political Avatars offer a significantly more robust solution for profile construction. While QA models provide structured responses based on specific queries, political avatars bring an element of dynamism and depth, capable of generating nuanced, context-aware responses. This shift from static, questionnaire-based profiling to dynamic, AI-driven avatars marks a substantial leap in political analysis. Generative AI in crafting Political Avatars introduces a transformative element to data analysis. This approach facilitates a layered and more sophisticated interpretation of political stances, moving beyond the limitations of traditional profiling methods. By employing political avatars, our methodology not only streamlines the profiling process but also enriches the quality of insights derived, paving the way for a more nuanced understanding of the political landscape.},

 abstract = {The launch of the generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) application ChatGPT by OpenAI launched artificial intelligence into public discourse and led to a wave of mass uptake of this technology in organizations in the private sector. At the same time, AI is increasingly incorporated into government functions and the public sector. We propose that governments and the public sector can set an example for the responsible use of AI technologies by following the principles of algorithmic governance traditionally recommended to the private sector. Algorithmic governance has traditionally been defined in the literature as governance by algorithms, or how artificial intelligence is used to make governance decisions and affect social ordering. However, we take an alternative approach; instead, we conceptualize algorithmic governance as the governance of algorithms. We begin by summarizing the risks of generative AI use in government, then outline algorithmic governance principles, a step-by-step approach to implementing algorithmic governance into government or public sector projects, opportunities for inter-sector collaboration, and final conclusions.},

 abstract = {The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced a monumental shift with the emerging of Generative AI (GenAI), which has demonstrated to be a transformative tool across diverse sectors. GenAI outputs can span various digital formats, including text, images, videos, and audio, generating particular interest in the public sector. The growing interest of governments in integrating GenAI technologies in public sector operations is marked by the creation of emerging governance instruments and the formulation of soft laws, like standards, principles, and guidelines. This study aims to delve into the intricacies and potential risks associated with the deployment of GenAI within government. Through a qualitative content analysis, the research meticulously examines GenAI usage guidelines issued by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and South Korea. The objective is to discern the risks acknowledged by these countries' soft laws and compare them with the risks identified by scholars in the field. The performed comparative analysis across countries suggest that the use of GenAI in the public sector raises common risks such as information leakage, data privacy, security, and concerns over public trust. By elucidating the varied risk perceptions across different national contexts, this study provides theoretical and practical implications related to the risks of GenAI within the public sector. Moreover, it sets a foundation for future research and policy development, ensuring that generative AI is used as a force for good in public governance.},

 abstract = {As a result of the prominence of generative artificial intelligence across diverse fields, it has become necessary for governments to develop national strategies for directing the ethical use of artificial intelligence to respect fundamental human values. This paper explores the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in technology sovereignty, its contributions, and benefits for the government, associated risks, and challenges, and how it influences government policies. It begins with examining GAI's capabilities to comprehend how it understands natural language, trains on existing data, and generates realistic outputs, followed by a discussion of its potential benefits for governments that enable them to act independently and autonomously in diverse sectors. It highlights how it can empower them to administer technological ecosystems, promote domestic innovation, and facilitate policy-making processes. However, contrary to its benefits, GAI is also capable of inflicting negative consequences on society. Therefore, the paper also addresses the risks and challenges associated with GAI that necessitate reflection on existing policies and developing new ones that align with a nation's legal frameworks. Exploring the influence of GAI on government policies, the paper highlights the significance of collaboration in policy-making endeavors to ensure ethical future developments and bring value to public interest and democratic values. This comprehensive analysis aims to shed light on the responsible and ethical use of GAI to preserve human rights, promote economic growth, sustain social justice, and inform the responsible use of GAI within the framework of technology sovereignty.},

 abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems bring innovative ways of information provision and knowledge delivery. In the public sector, generative AI has the potential to decrease bureaucratic discretion in the decision-making process. Increasing reliance on this technology brings challenges of unfair treatment, colonized responses from the system, and data governance. Because of historical interaction, tribal communities are the most underrepresented in policy planning and implementation. Indigenous communities suffer from the neglect of tribal sovereignty by the U.S. federal government and limited accessibility and literacy in the digital world. Generative AI systems exacerbate these challenges with insufficient tribal input. However, the negative impact can be alleviated with digital equity and knowledge cocreation. Digital equity emphasizes the importance of tribal knowledge representation, and knowledge cocreation focuses on the collaboration between Indigenous communities and relevant actors in data governance for generative AI systems. This study proposes two research questions to discuss tribal knowledge cocreation in generative AI systems: (1) what are the biases in the system responses from the tribal perspective? (2) what are the potential resolutions for these problems? The findings from in-depth interviews with tribal members in the U.S. indicate that the insufficient articulation of tribal culture, the lack of crucial tribal historical events, and the inappropriate appellation of tribal nations are the primary drawbacks in the system responses. From the Indigenous perspective, tribal oral traditions, native publications and documents, and collaboration with tribal governments can address the problems of generative AI responses. This study contributes to the theory development of digital equity and knowledge cocreation in tribal generative AI system responses. Policy recommendations and future research agendas are included in this research.},

Using a comparative research methodology, the study analyzed the most recent policy documents from these regions through text-mining techniques to assess their key differences in terms of word frequency and specific content. This work highlights the different strategies, goals, and approaches to regulating generative AI across the regions. It found that the EU adopts a more comprehensive and stringent regulation of generative AI, emphasizing regional harmonization and foresight; the U.S. regulation is characterized by pragmatism, closely aligned with industry innovation, and a focus on risk avoidance; while China focuses more on macro-level regulation aimed at promoting innovation and encouraging ecological construction.Participants may be interested in this study because it not only uses up-to-date materials but also employs text-mining methods to present the findings in a clearer way than previous studies. It provides insights into how regulatory policies for generative AI affect the development and practice of digital government. The study sheds light on different countries’ strategies for technology governance, which is crucial for understanding and designing effective digital government policies. In addition, due to the potential of generative AI technologies to deliver public services and drive government transparency, these insights help participants better assess the opportunities and challenges of technological innovation in the digital government space.},

It is born to solve the problems faced by the previous generation of the Internet such as imbalanced distribution of interests, monopoly of platform resources, and leakage of personal privacy. In this survey, we discuss the latest development status of Web 3.0 and the application of emerging AI technologies in it. First, we investigate the current successful practices of Web 3.0 and various components in the current Web 3.0 ecosystem and thus propose the hierarchical architecture of the Web 3.0 ecosystem from the perspective of application scenarios. The architecture we proposed contains four layers: data management, value circulation, ecological governance, and application scenarios. We dive into the current state of development and the main challenges and issues present in each layer. In this context, we find that AI technology will have great potential. We first briefly introduce the role that artificial intelligence technology may play in the development of Web 3.0. Then, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the current application status of artificial intelligence technology in the four layers of Web 3.0 and provide some insights into its potential future development directions.},

 abstract = {Mathematical stories have demonstrated the ability to bolster the motivation and interest of students in learning mathematics, thereby exerting a positive influence on their academic performance. However, due to a lack of adequate resources and the desire to engage students in the creation process, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is utilized to generate mathematical stories accompanied by images. This study presents a framework for automatic quality assessment to evaluate the coherence of multimodal text and images generated by GAI, as well as the appropriateness of the stories for different grade levels. The dataset comprises mathematical stories generated by GAI for grades 3, 4, and 5, obtained from an American online learning platform, each story consisting of titles, bodies, and image illustrations generated by GP4, images generated by DALL-E3. Initially, a method is devised based on CLIP model and Mini-GPT4 for extracting multimodal semantic features to establish the relationship between text and images in mathematical stories and their generation parameters. Subsequently, mathematical text features are designed, including nine mathematical text attributes and ten traditional text readability indicators, followed by collinearity feature selection and statistical testing. Finally, five machine learning grade regressor for mathematical stories were trained, and the correlation between these 19 features and grades is explored using genetic algorithm-based factor mining and the interpretable artificial intelligence method SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To further understand advanced text features, the latest natural language processing (NLP) readability indicators are also integrated into the analysis. Through multimodal features, traditional text readability metrics, and NLP readability indicators, this method introduces a novel approach for automatically assessing the quality of GAI-generated multimodal mathematical stories, providing a tool for grade predictor and shedding light on the factors (Image-text relevance and textual features) influencing the grade level of analyzed stories, thereby offering new insights for leveraging GAI in mathematical education.},

For example, medical staff repeatedly process the contextual data in each stage of the prenatal examinations, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. If a dispute happens, the data will become the evidence to support whether the prenatal examinations were handled appropriately. Therefore, if the prenatal examination data is not accurately recorded and properly preserved, it will become a source of pressure for medical staff to face disputes in the future. This research takes the prenatal examinations of pregnant as a use case. We apply robotic process automation technology to assist in the automation of prenatal examinations and blockchain technology to establish trustworthy prenatal examinations. Besides, we also use generative artificial intelligence technology to provide intelligent user-assisted consultation in open-domain question answering. The contribution of this work is to build an automated reliable prenatal examination information service to provide good care for pregnant.},

As educators, we need to understand the potential and limitations of AI in HCI education and ensure our graduating HCI students are aware of the potential and limitations of AI in HCI. In this paper, we report on the main pedagogical insights gained from the inclusion of generative AI into a 10-week undergraduate module. We designed the module to encourage student experimentation with GAI models as part of the design brief requirement and planned practical sessions and discussions. Our insights are based on replies to a survey sent out to the students after completing the module. Our key findings, for HCI educators, report on the use of AI as a persona for developing project ideas and creating resources for design, and AI as a mirror for reflecting students’ understanding of key concepts and ideas and highlighting knowledge gaps. We also discuss potential pitfalls that should be considered and the need to assess students’ literacies and assumptions of GAIs as pedagogical tools. Finally, we put forward the case for educators to take the opportunities GAI presents as an educational tool and be experimental, creative, and courageous in their practice. We end with a discussion of our findings in relation to the TPACK framework in HCI.},

 abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is versatile for various applications, but security and privacy concerns with third-party AI vendors hinder its broader adoption in sensitive scenarios. Hence, it is essential for users to validate the AI trustworthiness and ensure the security of data boundaries. In this paper, we present a dye testing system named Dye4AI, which injects crafted trigger data into human-AI dialogue and observes AI responses towards specific prompts to diagnose data flow in AI model evolution. Our dye testing procedure contains 3 stages: trigger generation, trigger insertion, and trigger retrieval. First, to retain both uniqueness and stealthiness, we design a new trigger that transforms a pseudo-random number to a intelligible format. Second, with a custom-designed three-step conversation strategy, we insert each trigger item into dialogue and confirm the model memorizes the new trigger knowledge in the current session. Finally, we routinely try to recover triggers with specific prompts in new sessions, as triggers can present in new sessions only if AI vendors leverage user data for model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on six LLMs demonstrate our dye testing scheme is effective in ensuring the data boundary, even for models with various architectures and parameter sizes. Also, larger and premier models tend to be more suitable for Dye4AI, e.g., trigger can be retrieved in OpenLLaMa-13B even with only 2 insertions per trigger item. Moreover, we analyze the prompt selection in dye testing, providing insights for future testing systems on generative AI services.},

The ability to analyze considerable streams of data in real time makes these technologies the most promising tool in many domains, including cybersecurity. As an outstanding example, ML can be used for identifying malware because of its ability to detect patterns otherwise difficult to see for humans and hard-coded rules. However, the use of AI and ML in security-relevant domains raised rightful concerns about their trustworthiness and robustness, espe- cially in front of adaptive attackers. Additionally, privacy threats are now emerging as a crucial aspect and need proper testing and possibly mitigation to prevent data stealing and leakage of sensitive information.

 abstract = {AI/ML techniques have been used to solve systems problems, but their applicability to customize solutions on-the-fly has been limited. Traditionally, any customization required manually changing the AI/ML model or modifying the code, configuration parameters, application settings, etc. This incurs too much time and effort, and is very painful. In this paper, we propose a novel technique using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology, wherein instructions can be provided in natural language and actual code to handle any customization is automatically generated, integrated and applied on-the-fly. Such capability is extremely powerful since it makes customization of application settings or solution techniques super easy. Specifically, we propose ECO-LLM (LLM-based Edge Cloud Optimization), which leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to dynamically adjust placement of application tasks across edge and cloud computing tiers, in response to changes in application workload, such that insights are delivered quickly with low cost of operation (systems problem). Our experiments with real-world video analytics applications i.e. face recognition, human attributes detection and license plate recognition show that ECO-LLM is able to automatically generate code on-the-fly and adapt placement of application tasks across edge and cloud computing tiers. We note that the trigger workload (to switch between edge and cloud) for ECO-LLM is exactly the same as the baseline (manual) and actual placement performed by ECO-LLM is only slightly different i.e. on average (across 2 days) only 1.45\% difference in human attributes detection and face recognition, and 1.11\% difference in license plate recognition. Although we tackle this specific systems problem in this paper, our proposed GenAI-based technique is applicable to solve other systems problems too.},

 abstract = {This study examined 120 Turkish stories written for primary, secondary, high school, and undergraduate education levels by ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini1.5 Pro. The data was processed by software created with Natural Language Processing methods in mind. The general characteristics, quantitative characteristics, and readability of the stories were all reviewed within the scope of the study. Using the Ate\c{s}man and Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formulas, which are widely used for Turkish texts, the readability of the stories was calculated. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that AI is able to produce distinct stories, and it generates cohesive stories by utilizing subjects and themes that are suitable for a specific educational audience. When the average readabilities are taken into account, it has been found that ChatGPT-3.5 generates better stories suited for the education level based on the Ate\c{s}man formula and Gemini based on the Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formula, and the difficulty level of ChatGPT-3.5 stories rises in tandem with education level in both formulas. Also, the stories at the undergraduate level were found to be the hardest to read and with primary schools having the easiest readability. When the number of stories at readability levels is taken into account, it has been found that GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 in the Ate\c{s}man formula and ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini in the Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formula generate appropriate stories for the education level; the levels range from easy to difficult as the education level increases. Additionally, it has been found that the number of stories included is gradually increasing. It was concluded that AIs produced stories above their educational level; while ChatGPT-3.5 and Gemini were more successful in story production, the Bezirci-Y\i{}lmaz formula was better in determining readability.},

This work-in-progress proposes a study to explore the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in promoting critical consciousness, which is the ability to recognize and take action against inequality and injustice, among middle school students.&nbsp; Framed by Constructionism theory, this study will explore designed activities where students will collaboratively use GAI to create meaningful artifacts addressing social issues. Through a curriculum embedded with GAI-driven activities, students will engage in dialogues, collaborative projects, and reflective practices on environmental injustice. The collaboration with GAI will result in the co-creation of artifacts. Qualitative methods centering on reflective interviews will shed light on students’ collaborative co-creative processes to understand how these experiences influence their perspectives and critical thinking abilities.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, Generative Large Language Models (GLLMs) have made a significant impact in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). One of the domains extensively explored for these models is their ability as generators of functional source code for software projects. Nevertheless, their potential as assistants to write the code needed to generate and model Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) architectures has not been fully explored to date. For this reason, this work focuses on evaluating the extent to which different tools based on GLLMs, such as ChatGPT or Copilot, are able to correctly define the source code necessary to generate viable predictive models. The use case defined is the forecasting of a time series that reports the indoor temperature of a greenhouse. The results indicate that, while it is possible to achieve good accuracy metrics with simple predictive models generated by GLLMs, the composition of predictive models with complex architectures using GLLMs is still far from improving the accuracy of predictive models generated by human data scientists.},

 abstract = {Multimodal generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers new affordances for inclusive education, particularly for children with vision impairments (CVIs), by enabling alternate representations that align with non-visual mental models. While GenAI tools are rapidly reshaping mainstream educational practices worldwide, their design and deployment often presume a digitally literate, sighted teaching workforce and well-resourced institutional contexts. In this paper, we address a critical gap in HCI and accessibility research: the near-total absence of empirical studies on teachers with vision impairments (TVIs), who play a central pedagogical role in schools for the blind across the Global South. Through in-depth interviews with 15 TVIs in Karnataka and a nationwide survey of 105 TVIs across 15 Indian states, we surface the everyday teaching practices, technological aspirations, and systemic constraints that shape their engagement with digital technologies, including GenAI. Our findings reveal a disjuncture between the potential of GenAI and the readiness of the institutional and infrastructural ecosystem in which TVIs operate. We document pervasive challenges, including limited access to devices and connectivity, insufficient training, resistance from school management, and entrenched barriers to STEM education, while also highlighting sites of resilience, innovation, and professional commitment. This study advances the HCI discourse by centering disabled educators as key agents in the design of accessible educational futures. We argue that realizing GenAI’s inclusive potential requires moving beyond assistive technology retrofits toward co-designed, contextually grounded systems that respond to the lived realities of TVIs in the Global South.},

Our work builds on this scholarship by investigating how neurodivergent individuals use Large Language Model-based chatbots in real-life settings. We conducted interviews with 15 neurodivergent participants to understand their expansive use of these chatbots, which we present as use case categories. We then designed diary studies to capture prompting strategies participants employ within these use cases while conversing with the Large Language Model-based chatbot Gemini.

Emerging AI tools, such as generative AI, can help people understand contexts where they lack subject expertise. This work explores how university Disability Services Office (DSO) professionals write alt text for scientific figures without subject expertise. We conducted a user study with 12 DSO professionals who authored alt text for scientific figures, first without and then using generative AI. We assessed the participants’ processes for alt text generation and their confidence in the resulting output. We also conducted semi-structured interviews to understand DSO professionals’ experiences with the alt text generation. Our findings reveal that AI assistance improved participants’ confidence and efficiency, but introduced new challenges for interaction and trust. Participants expressed caution about relying on AI-generated descriptions without sufficient domain knowledge and editing. These insights highlight the need for AI-augmented tools that better scaffold the alt text writing process for accessibility professionals.},

We initiated the study by considering the traditional AT-making processes performed by OTs and prototyped a web interface that incorporates generative AI to support these processes. Through a series of user studies, we collected OTs' preliminary insights on how generative AI could bridge the gap between clinical reasoning and technical design, potentially streamlining the AT creation and adaptation process while maintaining the crucial element of personalized AT solutions. The study's findings highlight several key benefits of generative AI in OT practice: 1) customization of AT solutions tailored to individual client needs, 2) improved visualization capabilities for client communication, 3) inspiration for new AT design ideas, and 4) potential for rapid prototyping and practice. However, key drawbacks were noted, including limitations in inputting measurements, which can lead to inaccurate outputs and necessitate substantial modifications to the created AT, along with challenges associated with the current state of generative AI.},

 abstract = {In the past years, a growing number of highly-automated systems has build on Artificial-Intelligence (AI) capabilities, for example, self-driving vehicles or predictive health-state diagnoses. As for any software system, there is a risk that misbehavior occurs (e.g., system failure due to bugs) or that malicious actors aim to misuse the system (e.g., generating attack scripts), which can lead to safety and security incidents. While software safety and security incidents have been studied in the past, we are not aware of research focusing on the specifics of AI incidents. With this paper, we aim to shed light on this gap through a case survey of 240 incidents that we elicited from four datasets comprising safety and security incidents involving AI from 2014 to 2023. Using manual data analyses and automated topic modeling, we derived relevant topics as well as the major issues and contexts in which the incidents occurred. We find that the topic of AI incidents is, not surprisingly, becoming more and more relevant, particularly in the contexts of autonomous driving and process-automation robotics. Regarding security and its intersection with safety, most incidents connect to generative AI (i.e., large-language models, deep fakes) and computer-vision systems (i.e., facial recognition). This emphasizes the importance of security to also ensure safety in the context of AI systems, with our results further revealing a high number of serious consequences (system compromise, human injuries) and major violations of confidentiality, integrity, availability, as well as authorization. We hope to support practitioners and researchers in understanding major safety and security issues to support the development of more secure, safe, and trustworthy AI systems.},

Human behaviour, modeling and input are major aspects of designing visualization systems. Yet, the task of evaluating these developed visualization systems is both time-consuming and challenging, and it is often prone to cases where user evaluation is limited owing to a lack of different stakeholders and end users during the design process. Recognizing the potential of advanced Generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs), our study aims to explore their capabilities in evaluating web-based security visualization tools and dashboards, particularly in the context of smart cities and buildings. We study and compare the feasibility of using various LLMs available today, for conducting usability testing, serving as an additional resource given the limited availability of human participants. In particular, we focus on three different LLMs: Bing Chat, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4o. While each had its strengths and drawbacks, our findings revealed that the results obtained had a strong correlation with human test subjects. LLMs can be a valuable aid during evaluation, by offering in-depth insights and evaluations, tailored to the specific requirements of smart buildings, cities and automation cybersecurity. Moreover, our research and findings also reveal that LLMs can similarly be used for the evaluation of a wide range of other visual systems for industrial environments.},

Our empirical findings demonstrate that modeling correlations of audio-visual modalities is important for video-level deepfake detection. Therefore, we introduce the model denoted Audio-Visual Local-Global Neural Network (i.e., AV-LGNN) in which the core design is the proposed AV-LGI Module (Audio-Visual Local-Global Interaction Module). The AV-LGI Module is composed of three stages: Local Intra-Region Interaction, Global Inter-Region Interaction, and Local-Global Interaction, which can better capture detailed information at local-level and efficiently learn the fine-grained correlations of inter-modalities in video deepfake detection under lower computational overheads. We further propose an adaptive modality selection strategy to facilitate model learning. Besides, a variety of data augmentation techniques are incorporated for audio-visual branches to enhance the robustness of the AV-LGNN.

Gamification transforms educational content into interactive experiences, fostering deeper engagement and learning. Moreover, aligning with the mission of museum institutions for cultural heritage preservation, a module for digital conservation and reconstruction was developed resorting to photogrammetry-based approaches. This module aims to create a virtual catalog accessible to both experts and the general public. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools automate tasks such as generating thematic quizzes for gamification and cataloging scanned artifacts.

 abstract = {Starting in November 2022 with the free provision of ChatGPT, large language models (LLM) are now publicly available. This has significantly increased the number of publications that scope potential changes caused by the application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in various societal domains. The private use of AI and the economic integration of generative LLMs have increased significantly. However, for parliamentarians and parliamentary professionals, the technology often remains abstract, impacting everyday work only peripherally. Due to the special responsibility of parliaments, governments, and administrations as the organizational instances of society, and through the inherent legitimations by society itself, there is a necessity to examine the implications of the use of generative LLMs within these institutions and traditional structures as well as their influence on political system logic. The article analyzes the responses that the generative LLMs GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 have provided via ChatGPT, based on the same input command (prompt) over different times. The responses help to assess how LLMs can be used in the parliamentary context, to reflect what dangers exist as well as to respond to the question on how a business model of an AI department in parliament might look like. Furthermore, it shall be explored whether there are fluctuations in the quality of the responses and how these should be evaluated against the backdrop of the need for accurate and precise workflows in parliamentary operations. Ultimately, the article aims to provide an answer as to whether the application of ChatGPT together with the LLMs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 could already deliver this necessary quality and consistency for the parliamentarian working environment today.},

 abstract = {The co-occurring sector trends in the stock market reveal interdependencies among certain industry sectors. This study proposes a novel approach to construct index features by leveraging this correlation phenomenon to forecast the future trends of sector indices. By computing the correlation coefficients between sector indices, sectors with strong positive correlations with a specific sector are identified. The historical trends of these strongly correlated sectors are extracted, and a joint forecasting model based on Long Short-term Memory Networks (LSTM) is established. Multi-dimensional time-series features are extracted to predict the future trend changes of specific sector indices. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves effective results in predicting the trends of some industry sectors, obtaining weighted F1 score greater than 0.75 for multiple industry sectors such as Automotive Services and Energy Metals. The findings of this study suggest that leveraging industry sector correlations can enhance the accuracy and reliability of index trend forecasting, albeit with attention required to market risks and model errors in practical applications. This research provides insights and guidance for stock market trend forecasting studies.},

 abstract = {This study proposes a theoretical model for analyzing the risk contagion process resulting from unexpected decreases in fund NAV, which can trigger fire sales and asset price impacts. The model demonstrates that the effect of redemptions on asset prices is linear, and the subsequent impact on fund performance is contingent on the initial shock level and asset liquidity diversity. Our findings suggest that funds those holding illiquid stocks face higher liquidity risks, and the liquidity level of underlying common assets between mutual fund portfolios dictates the extent of losses in the liquidated stock prices and the connected fund NAVs. Second, higher liquidity levels of common assets result in lower level of portfolio overlap. These findings highlight the urgency of establishing unified liquidity standard measurements and a cash buffer criterion. To manage fund stability and liquidity effectively, it is essential to implement measures such as minimum cash requirements and optimized asset allocation. These strategies have been proven to offer valuable insights for achieving financial success.},

 abstract = {In order to solve the problem of low segmentation accuracy due to the interference of noise information such as light and shadow in the current lightweight blind segmentation model, we propose a fast tactile paving segmentation model based on reparameterize. The multi-branch training structure learns spatial features such as tactile paving, light and shadow while compensating for the loss of information in the feature map due to downsampling operations as well as enhancing the learning of its features in the channel dimension. The single-branch structure obtained after reparameterization of the multibranch structure ensures faster inference of the model as well as lower memory access costs. The introduction of coordinate attention allows the model to learn the distribution law of the features of tactile paving, light and shadow, etc. in the spatial dimension and automatically generate the attention map with weight information, effectively reducing the weight of the spatial structural features of noise such as light and shadow. Experiments show that the model's ability to resist interference from environmental noise such as light and shadow has been enhanced and the segmentation accuracy has been further improved under the premise of ensuring the inference speed.},

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in multilingual translation tasks involving Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Chinese. Compared to traditional multilingual baseline models, this method achieves a significant improvement with an average BLEU score increase of up to 1.34 in many-to-one translation scenarios and 0.7 in one-to-many translation scenarios.

 abstract = {Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has garnered widespread attention due to its ability to automatically generate diverse and valuable digital content. Integrating with AIGC, vehicular networks are evolving as the next-generation intelligent transportation system, i.e., vehicular Metaverses, which can significantly enrich the diverse and personalized immersive experience of vehicular applications for drivers and passengers. Nevertheless, due to the high demand for AIGC services and the limited coverage of RoadSide Units (RSUs), it is still challenging to efficiently allocate RSU resources for massive vehicular users. In this paper, we propose an attribute-aware auction-based mechanism for real-time resource allocation in vehicular AIGC services, which considers both price and non-monetary attributes. In this mechanism, we first formulate the resource-attribute matching problem as a weighted bipartite graph to determine potential market participants. Then, we train an auctioneer in a double Dutch auction using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to adjust the auction clocks efficiently during the clock adjustment process. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed DRL-based auction scheme outperforms existing baseline schemes in terms of average cumulative reward, convergence speed, social welfare, and auction information exchange costs.},

It is concluded that shorter and thicker piezoelectric patches can effectively improve the receiving sensitivity, bandwidth and stability of the receiving transducer. The series circuit connection mode has good reception sensitivity stationarity, and the reception sensitivity stationarity is improved by 23.8dB, but its reception sensitivity stationarity is extremely poor. The fixed boundary condition at both ends can obviously broaden the receiving bandwidth of impulse sound source receiver and transducer, but the receiving sensitivity of fixed boundary condition at both ends is smaller than that of free boundary condition and free boundary condition at one end. This conclusion has theoretical reference significance for the manufacture of impulse sound source receiving transducer.},

However, the accuracy of detection algorithms usually depends on manual precision labeling of a vast amount of data, which is less feasible in practical scene applications due to its high labeling cost. Moreover, the manual labeling process is prone to errors such as false labeling and missing labeling due to overlapping and small targets in the image. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a pseudo label generation algorithm based on semi-supervised learning for dense crowd datasets. The proposed algorithm employs the self-training method of target detection in semi-supervised learning to generate pseudo-labels offline. Furthermore, the algorithm uses existing point labels in dense crowd datasets to correct the positioning information, which significantly reduces the high labeling cost. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on three widely used benchmarks, ShanghaiTech, NWPU-Crowd, and UCF-QNRF, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

It then achieves more accuracy and personalization music recommendations based on the relationship model between emotion and music selection. This research not only expands the research scope in the field of music recommendation, but also provides new ideas and methods for the further development of intelligent music recommendation systems.},

 abstract = {The Putian dialect is an ancient language with a rich historical and cultural background. Currently, there is a lack of published research on automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology for the Putian dialect due to various reasons. One notable example is the absence of an audio corpus specifically for this dialect. Moreover, the pronunciation of Putian dialect significantly differs from that of Mandarin used in our daily lives. This paper aims to address these challenges by collecting 8000 isolated words from a phonetic corpus dedicated to the Putian dialect. Based on this self-built database, I attempt to achieve speech recognition for the Putian dialect using various models such as single phoneme model recognition, three-phoneme model, linear discriminant analysis, maximum likelihood change, speaker adaptive training, quick model and DNN-HMM model. Notably, the DNN-HMM-2 model yields the best results with a word error rate of 20.56\%. In this experiment, I introduce an additional layer of mapping in order to construct a two-step mapping method for phoneme - Putian dialect - Mandarin alignment. This approach improves training alignment accuracy and reduces character error rate by approximately 3\% compared to using only one-level mapping.},

 abstract = {Early image style transfer algorithms heavily relied on strict image pairing between target and source domains, which is highly challenging in practice. Algorithms that do not depend on paired data have significant practical significance. In order to achieve the style transfer between Chinese ink paintings and Van Gogh's artworks, this paper introduces a self-made new dataset and implements the transformation between these two artistic styles based on the CycleGAN network model. Furthermore, through methods such as data augmentation and learning rate adjustment, this study extensively explores the key factors affecting the learning process of the adversarial loss function in CycleGAN. The results reveal that augmenting the self-made dataset through data enhancement techniques, such as adding noise and color transformations, can enhance the robustness of the model. Additionally, employing the "learning rate warm-up" strategy effectively updates parameters during training, leading to better fitting to the optimal solution.},

 abstract = {In recent years, there has been significant progress in the quality of neural machine translation technology, largely attributed to the abundance of high-quality bilingual parallel sentences. However, low-resource languages face a challenge as the availability of bilingual parallel corpora is limited, leading to subpar translation performance. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a data augmentation approach based on semantic word replacement specifically designed for neural machine translation of low-resource languages. The method comprises two key steps: firstly, expanding the corpus of low-resource languages through semantic word replacement techniques; secondly, utilizing a neural grammar correction model to proofread the augmented bilingual parallel corpora. Subsequently, these corrected corpora are merged with the original corpus to mitigate the data scarcity for low-resource languages. Experimental evaluations were conducted on various low-resource language pairs (including Mongolian-Chinese, Tibetan-Chinese, Uyghur-Chinese, Arabic-Chinese) as well as English-German and German-English translation tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the translation quality of low-resource languages, achieving a maximum BLEU score improvement of up to 3.06 compared to the baseline system, underscoring the efficacy of the approach.},

 abstract = {The goal of Few Shot Object Detection (FSOD) task is to effectively train and deploy object detection models even in small datasets, in order to achieve high-precision object detection results. Due to the few shot size of the dataset, the model may have difficulty learning sufficiently generalized feature representations, which can lead to overfitting or underfitting issues. Specifically, the model performs well during training, but shows a significant poor performance on test. That's because model overfits the noise and specific samples of the data in the training set, resulting in the inability to generalize to new data. Secondly, in the case of few shots, the target category scale in the dataset is single, making it difficult for the model to distinguish the same target at different scales, which affects detection accuracy. In order to effectively perform FSOD tasks, this paper proposes a meta learning FSOD algorithm based on PRN-FPN. Firstly, a data augmentation module is proposed to address the issue of data scarcity in few shot situations. The module includes three conversion strategies: color, color, and histogram equalization. Combining these three strategies can effectively increase the diversity of scarce data. In order to improve the algorithm's recognition and detection of targets of the same category but different scales, a Predictor head Removing Network with Feature Pyramid Network (PRN FPN) module is proposed. The module adds CARAFE Feature Pyramid Network on the basis of Predictor head Removal Network (RPN), and has the ability to detect few shot objects at multiple scales by fusing features at different depths. Finally, the algorithm was trained and tested on the publicly available dataset Pascal VOC, and the experimental results showed its effectiveness.},

 abstract = {As personalized recommendation techniques continue to evolve and be applied, recommendation systems face a plethora of malicious attacks. In order to defend against potential malicious attacks, enhance the robustness of recommendation systems, and strengthen their ability to withstand attacks, it is necessary to propose a method based on Variational Graph Auto-encoders (VGAE) for generating shilling attacks. This method improves the VGAE model, models user profiles, and generates reconstructed user profiles that conform to the original rating patterns. By utilizing spectral clustering, users are selected from the original dataset as templates in a dispersed manner according to a certain attack scale. These templates are then matched with the most similar fake users in the reconstructed user profiles. Within these fake user profiles, ratings for the most popular items in each category and target item ratings are inserted. Finally, fake user profiles are generated and injected into the recommendation system to broadly promote target items to users of the system. Experimental results on the MovieLens 100k and 1M datasets demonstrate that this new method exhibits more stable attack performance and stronger detection evasion capabilities compared to traditional attack strategies, thereby better exposing existing issues within recommendation systems.},

 abstract = {Through the mechanism of propagating and aggregating information, graph neural networks have achieved impressive results in link prediction tasks. However, the higher-order patterns (higher-order links) prediction task is still challenging. The conventional idea directly expands existing methods used in pairwise relationship prediction. Information propagation is limited to local neighborhoods and the evaluation basis uses only the similarity between pairs of nodes. These methods fail to consider the underlying driving factors of higher-order formation processes. Therefore, a key strategy is introducing a driving factor that helps information propagation beyond the local scope and provides a global comparable criterion between multiple nodes. Cluster structure is one crucial driving factor observed in networks, where nodes within the same cluster exhibit similar behaviors and tend to form higher-order patterns. To this end, we use Clustering Information as a Driving factor for graph structure adjustments in Graph Convolutional Network (CIDGCN). CIDGCN uses clustering information to facilitate the prediction of higher-order patterns. It also extends the propagation of node information to the cluster level for Graph Convolutional Network to perform message-passing. Finally, we obtain more reliable features for higher-order patterns. CIDGCN is experimentally compared to four higher-order benchmarks, revealing its superiority in accurately predicting higher-order patterns.},

This learning paradigm has a broad application prospect in areas with high safety constraints, such as healthcare and robotic control. However, existing offline reinforcement learning algorithms often overlook the impact of the dataset's inherent multimodal distribution on policy optimization during the training phase, leading to compromised model performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel offline reinforcement learning algorithm based on mixture density policy network, MDPo ( Mixture Density Policy). The MDPo algorithm initially employs an expected regression loss function to train the value function. Subsequently, it constructs the policy using a mixture density network and trains the policy through a distributional constraint, ultimately learning a high-quality policy model under the combined influence of the reward signal and policy constraints. Predominantly leveraging mixture density networks, MDPo models the policy as a multimodal distribution, enhancing the policy's representational capacity to better fit the multimodal distribution of actions in the dataset, thereby increasing training process stability and improving model performance. Experiments conducted on the Antmaze task of the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that MDPo significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, also demonstrating the enhancement of training stability.},

This work focuses on the leakage of conditional judgment operations that occur before each point addition and point doubling operation. By identifying these information leakage points through SCA, electromagnetic radiation and power consumption information are collected and labeled. We conduct a dataset and transformed 1-dimensional signals into a 2D image for training. The trained model is subsequently used for testing.

This study introduces a novel framework for optimizing e-commerce logistics by integrating AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with Back Propagation (BP) neural networks, further refined through Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization. Utilizing cargo volume data over a two-year period, we developed a sophisticated ARIMA-BP model to forecast the daily cargo volume for each route for the subsequent month. The subsequent application of a GA-optimized BP neural network aims to achieve a multi-objective optimization, focusing on minimizing the impact of route disruptions and balancing workload distribution across the network. We employed network centrality measures—degree, closeness, and betweenness—to evaluate the significance of logistics sites and routes, enhancing the network's resilience and operational efficiency. This approach also facilitated the integration of new logistics sites and routes, bolstering network performance. Further, we introduced a stochastic perturbation technique to explore the network's adaptability to both anticipated and unforeseen flow changes post-route closure. Finally, complex network topology analysis was applied to assess the robustness of the logistics network. Our methodology exemplifies a comprehensive strategy for e-commerce logistics optimization, offering a robust framework for enhancing network resilience and efficiency in face of emergencies, thereby contributing to the reduction of operational costs and improvement of service quality.},

The case results indicate that for the long-distance transportation of goods such as consumer electronics, which have a very high time-value cost, it is more appropriate to choose a multimodal transportation scheme based on road and railroad transportation, while waterway transportation does not have an advantage. In addition, further consideration of the uncertainty of the transportation time results in a transportation solution that ensures a higher probability of on-time delivery, while the total cost increases slightly but the transportation time decreases. The transportation scheme is more stable. The results of this paper provide a reference basis for the actual multimodal transportation path optimization problem of consumer electronics.},

 abstract = {To ensure the safe transportation of hazardous goods while minimizing transportation costs, a multi-objective optimization method is adopted to determine the optimal driving path of hazardous goods transportation vehicles. By simplifying the quantification process of risk factors for transportation vehicles passing through densely populated areas, with the goal of minimizing the number of vehicles, the total transportation distance, and the shortest driving distance through densely populated areas, an optimization model for the transportation path problem of hazardous goods vehicles is established. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on probability model is designed for the model. Taking a hazardous material transportation network with 5 transportation vehicles, 24 demand nodes, and 6 densely populated areas as an example, validate the model and algorithm. The example results show that the Pareto solution of the vehicle routing problem can be obtained using this algorithm, providing decision support for the scheduling of hazardous goods transportation vehicles.},

 abstract = {AI-pair programming is a novel approach to software development that involves a human developer and an AI assistant working together on the same code. AI-pair programming aims to improve the productivity, quality, and creativity of software development by leveraging the complementary strengths of human and AI agents. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on its impact on code quality and developer satisfaction. In this paper, we conduct a case study of TiMi studio, a leading mobile game development studio group that has been using AI-pair programming tools since 2023, and has produced several popular and high-quality games. We collect and analyze data from code repositories, code reviews, developer surveys, and developer interviews, to measure and compare the code quality and developer satisfaction of AI-pair and non-AI-pair projects. The results show that AI-pair programming has a positive impact on code quality and developer satisfaction, as it offers various benefits, such as time-saving, error-avoiding, skill-learning, possibility-exploring, feedback-receiving, and quality-improving. The results also reveal some challenges, such as reliability-questioning, explainability-questioning, trust-lacking, communication-lacking, autonomy-losing, and motivation-losing, which need to be addressed and overcome by improving and enhancing the AI-pair programming tools and practices. The paper provides empirical and practical evidence on the impact of AI-pair programming on code quality and developer satisfaction, and provides useful and actionable insights and guidance for developers, managers, researchers, and educators, who are interested in or involved in AI-pair programming, and who want to improve and optimize their software development process and outcomes.},

To address these issues, we propose a unified framework to evaluate model robustness under different types of attacks. This framework integrates non-Lp and Lp attacks, and comprehensively evaluates the robustness of various advanced robust models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet subsets. Experimental results show that even the most advanced defense models exhibit vulnerabilities under certain new types of attacks, highlighting the importance of developing more comprehensive robustness benchmarks and providing guidance for the design of future robust deep learning models.},

In such an environment, system logs, as key data that record the operating status of computer systems, user operations and various events, play an extremely important role in monitoring system health and quickly locating and resolving system failures. However, the current accuracy of log parsing is not high enough to meet the actual demand; the parsing process is inefficient and difficult to adapt to the processing requirements of large data log files. Aiming at the problems of insufficient accuracy of log parsing and low efficiency of parsing process, a log parsing method AT-parser (Log parser based on word attributes and parse trees) is proposed. Through the log preprocessing, the log content used in the subsequent construction of log templates can be separated, the log content combined with word attribute filtering, retaining the key words, constructing a string set through the key words, and then performing similarity clustering based on the string set to classify the log strings into different log groups. Finally, the final template sequence is generated by constructing a parse tree, which improves the accuracy and speeds up the parsing efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness of AT-Parser is verified by experiments on public datasets.},

 abstract = {The accurate decoding and intention recognition of motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) are of great significance for the implementation of brain computer interface (BCI). However, the time non-stationary properties of MI-EEG signals and the uneven information distribution of different electrode channels pose challenges to the classification of MI-EEG. To address these challenges, we proposed a convolutional network based on channel and temporal attention (CTACNet). First, raw MI-EEG signals underwent noise reduction by common average reference. Subsequently, channel attention module was used to enhance the electrode channel information related to classification. Then, shallow spatiotemporal features of MI-EEG were extracted through convolutional neural network, and time series representations containing spatial information were output. Importantly, time attention module automatically adjusted and learned the impact of different time series on classification. Finally, deep spatiotemporal features were further extracted through time convolutional network, and fully connected layers were used to complete the classification of MI-EEG. Validation experiments based on the BCI competition IV-2a dataset showed that the proposed CTACNet achieved an average classification accuracy of 84.22\% for each subject. Compared with MBEEGSE, ETCNet, EEG-TCNet, and CNN-LSTM, there were significant improvements of 2.20\%, 9.42\%, 4.50\%, and 5.40\%, respectively. This demonstrates the potential of CTACNet in significantly enhancing MI-EEG decoding and intent recognition.},

To address the challenge of low query efficiency and avoid data loss, this paper proposes a two-stage coarsening method that preserves key features of a streaming graph while improves query efficiency. In the initial stage, the size of the streaming graph is not that large yet. To preserve its structure and attributes as much as possible, a linear mapping method is used for graph coarsening. As the size of the streaming graph increases, a graph neural network model based on cluster pooling is constructed in the second stage. Using a large number of graph coarsening results obtained in the initial stage to train and optimize this model. Then, we use this optimized model to obtain the subsequent summaries, which achieves online efficient graph coarsening. Finally, extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm significantly improves the quality of streaming graph coarsening compared to traditional algorithms.

Grounded on the existing modes of legislation and judicial adjudication, the paper proposes machine learning methods to deconstruct the determination of acts of infringement, with a goal of assisting judges in making more accurate judgments.

Through training and evaluation, the paper reveals that these models possess favorable applicability in determining the acts of infringement. Moreover, the paper also mentions the predictive results and evaluation metrics of the models, as well as their validation and application under various determination methods.Through the application of mathematical models and machine learning algorithms, the paper deconstructs the methods of infringement determination in personal information protection disputes.

 abstract = {With the popularization of big data and Internet of things technology, the amount of time series data is exploding, which makes anomaly detection in time series particularly important. Anomaly detection aims to find those data points or behaviors that do not conform to regular patterns. This study proposes an innovative unsupervised time series anomaly detection algorithm that is able to dynamically learn and adapt to anomalies in real-time data streams by combining reinforcement learning, spectral residual (SR), and variational encoder (VAE) techniques. We use a two-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) model and a self-attention network to build a reinforcement learning agent that is able to integrate temporal information of time series data to optimize policies. In addition, we propose a novel unsupervised reinforcement learning model by combining SR and VAE as the reward function. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the other four methods on two public datasets and one real-world dataset.},

So, it will be detected with an improved YOLOv5 to raise its accuracy. Firstly, training samples will be expanded to solve the problem that soil profile images are less. Then to boost the detection accuracy and enhance generalization ability of the model, this paper adopts transfer learning and injects Channel Attention mechanism into YOLOv5 backbone network.

 abstract = {Addressing the performance and efficiency challenges of detecting small target defects on PCB (printed circuit board), this research proposes a lightweight inspection model for YOLOv8-based. The initial step involves employing an enhanced Efficient_Detect network architecture with the aim of diminishing the volume of model parameters and computational intricacy, while simultaneously augmenting resource utilization. Then, the deformable convolutional networks v2 (DCNv2) are integrated into the C2f structure to improve feature extraction for defects with diverse shapes on the PCB surface, enhancing the model's capability to identify different categories of flaws. Meanwhile, the Inner-SIoU loss function is utilized instead of the conventional CIoU loss function to enhance both the precision of inspection and the robustness of the model. The enhanced approach achieves an mAP50 of 96.8\% and an mAP50-95 of 72.2\%, marking an improvement of 3.9\% and 10.1\%, respectively, comparison with base YOLOv8n model. In addition, the parameter counts of the model, GFLOPs, and weight size are notably reduced by 18.4\%, 33.3\%, and 19.7\%, respectively, resulting in final metrics of 2.34 M, 5.4 GFLOPs, and a weight size of 4.9 M. In addition, the detection speed can reach up to 161 FPS, which has the potential for real-time detection.

This approach aims to overcome challenges related to the limited capacity for extracting features from irregularly shaped road crack targets and the sluggish inference speed caused by the intricate model structure. In this algorithm, YOLOv7 is used as the foundation. Firstly, the Detect module is improved to a Decoupled Head Detect module to augment the detection capacity of the model on feature maps. Then, the Head part is augmented with an ELAN-G module based on GSConv to reduce the model's parameter computation and accelerate the inference speed. Finally, Deformable Conv is employed to modify the original ELAN module into an ELAN-D module and integrate it into the Backbone part to bolster the model's capability in extracting irregular-shaped crack targets. Experimental results on the CRDDC-2020-US dataset demonstrate that the improved algorithm achieves a 10\% enhancement in detection accuracy, with the mAP(0.5) increasing from 53.7\% to 59.4\%. Furthermore, the model's parameter computation is decreased by 12\%, while the throughput in terms of the number of images processed per second during inference is boosted by 13\%.

Air pollutants have strong spatio-temporal correlation, and the current air quality prediction methods often fail to adequately extract the spatio-temporal features in the data, which can cause prediction accuracy problems. This paper proposed a Self-Tuning Spatio-Temporal Residual Network (AAM-AST2RN) fusing adaptive adjacency matrix and attention mechanism for enhanced air quality prediction. AAM-AST2RN utilized a parallel network structure, which was capable of fully extracting and fusing spatio-temporal features and automatically adjusting the network hyperparameters. In addition, the AAM-AST2RN model constructed the AAM generation module, residual connection and Improved Channel Attention mechanism (ICA), the AAM generation module avoided the adverse effect of static adjacency matrix on the model feature extraction, the residual connection and ICA effectively alleviated the node feature over-smoothing problem caused by Graph Convolutional neural Network (GCN) in the model and improved the node feature differentiation. In order to validate the model effect, the model was utilized to predict the AQI of 12 air monitoring sites in Beijing, and compared with the prediction effect of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory neural network (ConvLSTM), combined Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory neural network (CNN-LSTM), and GCN-LSTM. Compared with the above three spatio-temporal prediction models, the coefficient of determination (R2) of the AAM-AST2RN model was improved by 11.30\%, 1.95\%, and 1.54\%, respectively, and the prediction error was lower. The AAM-AST2RN air quality prediction model proposed in this paper can fully extract the spatio-temporal features in the data and has a good prediction performance for air quality.},

The initial multi-scale structure based on LIBP was innovatively used to extract the shallow feature information of the network. Features were extracted from high-dimensional data using the inverted residual structure, and redundant feature maps were generated in a cheaper way by Ghost convolution. Random depth structure and flooding regularization were used to prevent overfitting of the model. To evaluate the validity of the proposed model, a series of comparative experiments were conducted. Compared with the standard residual network, the accuracy of the model proposed in this paper was improved by 5.90\% and 9.72\% respectively under -4dB and -10dB noise. The model parameter was reduced from 25.7M to 1.98M, FLOPs were reduced by about 75.2\%, and other performance indicators were also improved at different amplitudes.

To tackle these issues, this paper introduces a multi-feature EEG emotion recognition model based on 1D-Inception (1D-Inception-Channel-Spatial-LSTM Network, DCSL). DCSL integrates channel information, spatial features, and temporal dependencies, resulting in more effective EEG emotion recognition.

The Channel Attention Module is introduced to learn the weights of different channels, enhancing emotion recognition performance. Additionally, a Spatial Attention mechanism is incorporated to further extract spatial features from EEG signals. To better capture the temporal dependencies in EEG signals, an LSTM module is introduced at the end of the model.

Deep Convolutional Networks (DCN) have emerged as practical tools in addressing these challenges, particularly in skin cancer diagnosis. The research aims to explore the performance of various neural networks in skin cancer recognition, assessing metrics such as accuracy (ACC), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The study uses modified DCN classifiers, namely ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121, on the HAM10000 dataset. The results demonstrate that the modified InceptionV3 exhibited high performance compared to other networks, achieving a weighted accuracy of 86.58\% and a weighted ROC of 0.96.

 abstract = {Pedestrian detection is commonly studied using visible light (RGB) images. However, in environments with poor lighting or occlusions, the performance of object detection using RGB images tends to be subpar. In contrast, infrared (IR) images yield better results in such special circumstances. Therefore, multispectral image fusion for pedestrian detection is increasingly being adopted. While this feature interaction and fusion approach enhances features, it can also introduce background noise, preventing the model from focusing on pedestrians. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight network with Unet and attention mechanism (UANet). UANet enhances the accuracy of pedestrian detection under varying illuminance by combining the strengths of RGB-IR image pairs. In UANet, a UNet-based module is designed for extracting and reusing multi-scale features from RGB images. To further extract high-level features, we incorporate a fully connected module into the UNet-based module. For infrared images, we employ high-frequency attention and average attention to extract target features from infrared images and fuse them with RGB features. In experiments, we validate the effectiveness of UANet in improving pedestrian detection performance. We conducted tests on the KAIST dataset, yielding a result of 95.23\% mAP and 7.65\% MR.},

 abstract = {Causal inference is the idea of cause and effect; this fundamental area of sciences can be applied to problem space associated with Newton’s laws or the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. The cause explains the “why,” whereas the effect describes the “what.” The domain itself encompasses a plethora of disciplines from statistics and computer science to economics and philosophy. Recent advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence systems have nourished a renewed interest in identifying and estimating the cause-and-effect relationship from the substantial amount of available observational data. This has resulted in various new studies aimed at providing novel methods for identifying and estimating causal inference. We include a detailed taxonomy of causal inference frameworks, methods, and evaluation. An overview of causality for security is also provided. Open challenges are detailed, and approaches for evaluating the robustness of causal inference methods are described. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey on such studies of causality. We provide an in-depth review of causality frameworks and describe the different methods.},

 abstract = {In post-disaster scenarios, government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) work to coordinate disaster relief efforts efficiently, aiming to meet humanitarian needs promptly. Utilizing available data such as satellite imagery, sensor data, and social media, alongside data mining and big data analytics, can significantly enhance disaster management efforts. However, timely access to these often fragmented and incomplete data presents challenges. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, offer solutions by enabling faster response times for government agencies, NGOs, and other authorities. This research examines 72 studies on the application of AI in various stages of disaster management, including the simulation, detection, prediction, and handling of post-disaster situations. AI-based systems improve the issuance of early warnings, streamline risk communication, optimize relief logistics, and support evacuation plans while also aiding in the decision-making processes for the issuance of building permits and grants. The analysis highlights the transformative potential of AI across all disaster management phases, from preparedness and response to prevention/mitigation and recovery, and identifies future challenges in this domain. In conclusion, the study underscores the power of AI not only in forecasting the occurrence and impact zones of disasters but also in identifying the most vulnerable communities and assessing the viability of disaster response strategies.},

With several financial technology (FinTech) companies seizing the opportunity to be the first big fish in the market, a review on the impact of Artificial Intelligence in the FinTech industry around the world is necessary. While Artificial Intelligence provides significant benefits to FinTech companies, there are also risks and challenges that come with using AI. The availability of large datasets has paved the way for FinTech companies to utilize this opportunity to improve and transform their services. As the world moves on towards a cash-less future, people have been more inclined to use e-wallets and credit cards to perform their daily transactions. While this significantly improves the everyday financial experience of consumers, the lack of rigid authentication and verification usually leads to financial fraud that may eventually lead to billion-dollar loss from the consumer. Thus, this paper reviewed several articles on which different impacts of FinTech are discussed. Additionally, risks and challenges of usage of AI are also discussed. This paper shall serve as future reference for developing countries such as the Philippines in order to maximize their growth in the FinTech industry.},

 abstract = {Abstract: Increased use of generative artificial intelligence or AI in various academic activities such as programming is a significant milestone in technology diffusion in learning. To bring AI closer to how programmers think, behave, and interact, it is imperative for research to establish a clear connection between various human factors that lead to its adoption. Using a model based on the Theory of Reasoned Action, we positioned human traits of academic stress, risk propensity, neuroticism, and computer self-efficacy as factors that positively influence attitudes toward the use of AI in programming among university students. We further posited that attitude and social norms lead to the behavioral intention to use AI in programming. We used PLS-SEM to analyze responses from 131 programming students who use ChatGPT to accomplish learning tasks. We found that both academic stress and computer self-efficacy influence attitudes toward using AI in programming. While attitude positively influences the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT, we found that risk propensity and neuroticism do not affect attitude, and social norms do not influence behavioral intention. We discuss the implications of our investigation to the industry and the academe.},

 abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development and the various applications of artificial intelligence technology has been gradually replacing many labor-intensive and creative tasks. Traditional design education in schools invests considerable time in cultivating students' basic skills in using techniques, tools, materials, etc., but overlooks the wave which has been brought by artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence has surpassed human performance in specific fields and is poised to replace the work of many laborers. As artificial intelligence technology advances, its applications will permeate more areas, including thinking and creative abilities that humans have taken pride in. Design education in universities should re-examine the design values of human designers and artificial intelligence respectively. This redefinition of values implies that the abilities required of designers need to be reframed. Design education in universities should also explore how to integrate artificial intelligence-related technologies into current design curricula. New design courses must manifest the value of human designers. Furthermore, design programs offered by universities should begin planning training courses on collaborative design with artificial intelligence and establish relevant mechanisms for making artificial intelligence an effective tool to assist designers. In addition to redefining the value of designers and planning artificial intelligence-assisted design courses, design departments should monitor industry trends and gather year-by-year feedback to provide students with up-to-date career development advice. We should recognize the crisis that artificial intelligence presents to current design education and address the impact of this wave on design students. Artificial intelligence is progressing toward an irreversible trend, and the growth and transformation of designers will become a new challenge for future design education.},

 abstract = {When working with generative artificial intelligence (AI), users may see productivity gains, but content generated with the help of AI may not match their preferences exactly. The boost in productivity may come at the expense of users' idiosyncrasies, such as personal style and tastes, preferences we would naturally express without AI. To let users express their preferences, many AI systems let users edit their prompt (e.g., Midjourney) or allow more natural interactions (e.g., ChatGPT), and users can always review and edit the AI-generated output themselves. However, aligning a user's intentions with an AI's output can take time and may not always be worth it if the AI's first or default output "does the job." In short, users face a trade-off between AI output fidelity and communication cost. The purpose of this work is to examine the impact of this human-AI interaction on the AI-generated content we produce as a society.We propose a Bayesian model to study the societal consequences of human-AI interactions. For a given task, rational users can exchange information with the AI to align its output with their heterogeneous preferences. The AI has a knowledge of the distribution of preferences in the population and uses a Bayesian update to create the optimal output with maximal expected fidelity given the information shared by the user. Users choose the amount of information they share to maximize their utility, balancing the cost of communication with the fidelity of the output.We show that the interplay between individual users and AI may lead to societal challenges. Outputs may become more homogenized. The AI-generated output distribution has a lower variance than the users' preference distribution. And this phenomenon is exacerbated when AI-generated content is used to train the next generation of AI: we show numerically that the users' rational decisions and the AI's training process can mutually reinforce each other, leading to a homogenization "death spiral." We also study the effects of AI bias, identifying who benefits or loses when using an AI model that does not accurately reflect the population preference distribution. At the population level, the censoring type of bias (e.g., biasing against the more unique preferences) negatively impacts the population utility as a whole, especially users with uncommon preferences who rely on AI interactivity the most. On the other hand, directional biases (e.g., a slightly left-leaning AI) will influence the users' chosen output, leading to a societal bias. Nonetheless, our research also demonstrates that creating models that facilitate human-AI interactions can limit these risks and preserve the population preference diversity.A full version of this paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10448.},

 abstract = {This paper provides a new framework for studying the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the organization of knowledge work. We incorporate AI into an economy where humans endogenously form hierarchical firms: Less knowledgeable agents become "workers" solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable agents become "solvers" handling exceptions. We model AI as an algorithm that uses compute to mimic humans. We compare the equilibrium before and after AI's introduction, distinguishing between "basic" AI (with knowledge equivalent to pre-AI workers) and "advanced" AI (with knowledge equivalent to pre-AI solvers). We show that basic AI increases the knowledge content of human work, leading to smaller, less productive, and less decentralized firms. In contrast, advanced AI decreases the knowledge content of human work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized firms. In any case, the most knowledgeable humans benefit from AI, while the least knowledgeable benefit only when AI is sufficiently advanced. We discuss how these effects depend on AI's autonomy and the availability of compute. https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05481},

 abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can reshape education and learning. While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT dominate current educational research, multimodal capabilities—such as text-to-speech and text-to-image—are less explored. This study uses topic modeling to map the research landscape of multimodal and generative AI in education. An extensive literature search yielded 4175 articles. Employing a topic modeling approach, latent topics were extracted, resulting in 38 interpretable topics organized into 14 thematic areas. Findings indicate a predominant focus on text-to-text models in educational contexts, with other modalities underexplored, overlooking the broader potential of multimodal approaches. The results suggest a research gap, stressing the importance of more balanced attention across different AI modalities and educational levels. In summary, this research provides an overview of current trends in generative AI for education, underlining opportunities for future exploration of multimodal technologies to fully realize the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in education.},

 abstract = {This study investigated the students' perceptions of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in upper-secondary mathematics education. Data was collected from Finnish high school students to represent how key constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model—Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Enjoyment, and Intention to Use—influence the adoption of AI tools. First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how AI tools can be integrated into mathematics education and highlights key differences between the Finnish educational context and previous studies based on structural equation modeling.},

 abstract = {Since its launch just over two years ago, the conversational chatbot ChatGPT developed by OpenAI has become integrated into the studies of students within the Swedish educational system. This paper investigates both teachers’ perspectives and attitudes toward students using ChatGPT and the students’ view of their perceived learning. Insights were gathered through questionnaires (for both students and teachers) and a learning session for students, revealing concerns and enthusiasm regarding ChatGPT’s integration. Teachers express a lack of understanding on incorporating ChatGPT into education and perceive a lack of support from school leadership and the Swedish National Agency for Education. Identified scenarios suggest ChatGPT’s potential for understanding concepts, but resistance toward its use in examinations. The students have a statistically significant enhancement in confidence and understanding of magnetism concepts after engaging with ChatGPT. This research contributes to ongoing discussions about integrating AI tools in education, emphasizing benefits and addressing ethical concerns and learning outcomes.},

 abstract = {In recent years, many fields have expanded their research methods through the integration of artificial intelligence. In the current medical field, it is widely used in image recognition to diagnose patient symptoms, train clinical prediction models, and improve clinical workflow processes to avoid missing treatment opportunities. These methods have all achieved good results so far. Now, generative AI is also impacting the development of the medical field, not only generating prescriptions that match patient conditions but also being applied in generating medical images for data augmentation and simulating various pathological conditions, thereby aiding in training deep learning models. Stroke is a leading cause of death or disability, ranking as the second leading cause of death worldwide, next to cancer. If cancers were categorized individually, stroke would surpass all single diseases, making it a primary focus of research in brain disease treatment. There are already studies where generative AI has been used to create medical images, which are then manually evaluated by doctors to determine if they were generated by AI. In this project, we plan to generate CT images of strokes using generative AI and use a trained model (to diagnose stroke) to improve accuracy. Through this project, we hope to solve the problem of scarce stroke CT images while also providing support for training stroke-related models.},

With the continuous increase in the scale of new energy grid connection, the proportion of new energy grid connection is constantly increasing, and problems such as grid stability and power quality degradation are becoming increasingly prominent, which directly affects the widespread application of new energy generation technology. This article explored the research on a remote control system for new energy grid connected power generation based on artificial intelligence. Taking the island detection of photovoltaic grid connected inverters based on Adaboost algorithm as an example, the feasibility of the technology was verified through experiments. The experimental data showed that the accuracy, recall, and F0.5 of island effect prediction based on Adaboost algorithm were 0.98, 0.9523, and 0.7811, respectively, which were higher than other algorithms.},

Previous cleaning methods employ a sequential detect-repair paradigm, leaving over half of the errors unsolved in real scenarios. We introduce IterClean, an iterative data cleaning framework leveraging large language models (LLMs). Utilizing an iterative mechanism, the framework employs a two-step process: data labeling and iterative data cleaning. With few labeled data, IterClean leverages an iterative cleaning process involving an error detector, an error verifier, and an error repairer to significantly enhance the cleaning performance. Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that, IterClean achieves an F1 score that is up to three times higher than the best state-of-the-art approaches requiring only 5 labeled tuples.},

 abstract = {Labor market information is an important input to labor, workforce, education, and macroeconomic policy. However, granular and real-time data on labor market trends are lacking; publicly available data from survey samples are released with significant lags and miss critical information such as skills and benefits. We use generative Artificial Intelligence to automatically extract structured labor market information from unstructured online job postings for the entire U.S. labor market. To demonstrate our methodology, we construct a sample of 6,800 job postings stratified by 68 major occupational groups, extract structured information on educational requirements, remote-work flexibility, full-time availability, and benefits, and show how these job characteristics vary across occupations. As a validation, we compare frequencies of educational requirements by occupation from our sample to survey data and find no statistically significant difference. Finally, we discuss the scalability to collections of millions of job postings. Our results establish the feasibility of measuring labor market trends at scale from online job postings thanks to advances in generative AI techniques. Improved access to such insights at scale and in real-time could transform the ability of policy leaders, including federal and state agencies and education providers, to make data-informed decisions that better support the American workforce.},

However, nowadays, the development of AI is unpredictable with the stated values of those developing them; hence, the risk of misbehaving AI increases continuously. Therefore, there are uncertainties about endorsing that the development and deploying of AI are favorable and not unfavorable to humankind. In addition, AI holds a black-box pattern, which results in a lack of understanding of how systems can work based on the raised concerns. From the above discussion, trustworthy AI is vital for the extensive adoption of AI in many applications, with strong attention to humankind and the need to focus on AI systems developing into the system outline at the time of system design. In this survey, we discuss compound materials on trustworthy AI and the present state-of-the-art of trustworthy AI technologies, revealing new perspectives, bridging knowledge gaps, and paving the way for potential advances of robustness, and explainability rules which play a proactive role in designing AI systems. Systems that are reliable and secure and mimic human behavior significantly impact the technological AI ecosystem. We provide various contemporary technologies to build explainability and robustness for AI-based solutions, so AI works in a safer and more trustworthy manner.

 abstract = {Recent studies revealed an overwhelming concern about the misuse of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools by students in completing academic requirements. The detection of AI-generated content using the naked eye was perceived to be difficult, hence the need for more accurate, reliable, and effective detection methods. As a countermeasure, educators are turning to AI content detectors and plagiarism checkers to ascertain the originality of submitted school requirements, raising concerns from students regarding the accuracy and reliability of these tools and the ethical implications and negative consequences of misclassification of genuinely original works as machine-generated outputs. By employing a holistic case study approach, the authors attempted to determine the perceptions of selected university students on the use of AI detection systems by faculty members in checking the originality and novelty of their academic outputs. Through the lenses of various normative ethical theories, the authors also analyzed the ethical issues and concerns raised by selected students to better understand their sentiments and the factors they believe could influence the faculty members' intention to adopt this emerging technology. The results of the study revealed that students have mixed attitudes and perceptions toward the faculty's intention to use AI detectors. While students perceived it as a means to encourage independent learning and critical thinking, they also expressed valid concerns regarding fairness, accuracy, and reliability, the impact on teacher-student trust, and the responsible use of the technology, among others. The participants also acknowledged the influence of other faculty members and the students' increasing dependence on AI as possible enablers of technology adoption while technological limitations, the teachers’ lack of technological skills, and age as perceived barriers. From an ethical view, the findings of the study highlighted the importance of transparency, fairness, privacy, and the need for a policy to regulate AI use.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies like generative AI solutions are proliferating in the real-world healthcare sector. The purpose of this research is to investigate social norms, expectations, and standards of the elderly population for improving trust relationships while interacting with generative AI. The study is based on the CASA paradigm to gain a better understanding of the trust dynamics in human-computer communication to improve the adoption of GAI for elders' health and well-being. We validated the conceptual model with empirical data from 287 elderly users collected through an online and offline survey tool. Quantitative responses received were analysed using structural equation modeling. The study highlights how multimodal interaction, empathy, personalization, augmentation, bias stereotyping, and privacy and security affect the extent to which elderly consumers perceive GAI as trustworthy. Findings indicate that multimodal interaction, personalization, augmentation, and bias stereotyping significantly influenced the trust relationship between the elderly population and GAI. However, empathy privacy, and security were found to be insignificant in trust relationships. Further trust relationships significantly impacted GAI usage. The research provides strong theoretical and practical implications as all the stakeholders like healthcare professionals, patients/users, caregivers, and technology developers can be involved in building applications that cater to diverse needs and promote positive social interactions that can enhance GAI trust and usage.},

Utilizing GPT-4 to evaluate 1,022 core tasks across 51 public sector occupations, we provide an exploratory analysis of the roles susceptible to ChatGPT automation and those in which ChatGPT can augment human efforts. Our findings reveal that while 63\% of tasks are resistant to ChatGPT replacement, primarily due to their requirement for physical presence, emotional intelligence, and complex decision-making, tasks that are routine, rule-based, and involving basic content generation show a high potential for automation. The study also identifies key skills that will remain vital, those likely to become obsolete, and new skills that will emerge as essential, highlighting the need for a strategic approach to workforce development in the face of AI advancements. In particular, our findings underscore the growing importance of skills in applying AI technologies and the ability to validate and interpret AI-generated content for humans to remain competitive. We offer insights into public-sector-specific impacts and propose a methodological framework for future research, emphasizing the importance of adapting educational curricula and policies to prepare for an AI-integrated future.},

 abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for natural language understanding and text generation. An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step called LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on improving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as batching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify and map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of both processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators (e.g., GPUs). We observe that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a kernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet user and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and computation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach of designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even in memory-bound kernels.In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the dynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI (PA rallel Decoding with PI M), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that exploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to suitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel characterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware units at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that harmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units (GPU) and hybrid PIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on three broadly-used LLMs (i.e., LLaMA-65B, GPT-3 66B, and GPT-3 175B) show that PAPI achieves 1.8\texttimes{} and 11.1\texttimes{} speedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator (i.e., GPU and PIM) and a state-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively.},

 abstract = {Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3x higher throughput and consumes 2.3x less energy. CENT reduces the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2x more tokens per dollar than GPUs.},

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent collaboration system designed to enhance decision-making in financial investment research. The system incorporates agent groups with both configurable group sizes and collaboration structures to leverage the strengths of each agent group type. By utilizing a sub-optimal combination strategy, the system dynamically adapts to varying market conditions and investment scenarios, optimizing performance across different tasks. We focus on three sub-tasks: fundamentals, market sentiment, and risk analysis, by analyzing the 2023 SEC 10-K forms of 30 companies listed on the Dow Jones Index. Our findings reveal significant performance variations based on the configurations of AI agents for different tasks. The results demonstrate that our multi-agent collaboration system outperforms traditional single-agent models, offering improved accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability in complex financial environments.

 abstract = {The appearance of inflammatory language on social media by college or university students is quite prevalent, inspiring platforms to engage in community safety mechanisms. Escalating hate speech entails creating sophisticated artificial intelligence-based, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to detect offensive internet content. With a few noteworthy exceptions, the majority of the studies on automatic hate speech recognition have emphasized high-resource languages, mainly English. We bridge this gap by addressing hate speech detection in Punjabi (Gurmukhi), a low-resource Indo-Aryan language articulated in Indian educational institutions. This research identifies cross-lingual hate speech in the code-switched English-Punjabi language used on social media. It proposes an approach combining the best hate speech detection techniques to cover existing state-of-the-art system gaps and limitations. In this method, the Roman Punjabi is transliterated, and then Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) based models are employed for hate detection. The proposed model has achieved 0.86 precision and 0.83 recall, and various higher educational institutions could employ it to discover the issues/domains where hate prevails the most.},

 abstract = {In the landscape of rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and growing associated ethical concerns, we propose integrating ethical considerations into daily practices of the AI development teams, to address ethical concerns early, at the time of design and development of AI, which is a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing the AI-GFA (Assess, Implement, Gather Feedback, Act) framework, designed to enable proactive ethical assessments to predict potential risks associated with AI technologies. Through examination of existing ethical frameworks, legislation, principles, and guidelines, this paper aims to bridge the gap between high-level ethical guidelines and their practical application in AI development workflows. The framework emphasises transparency, accountability, and stakeholder involvement, and aligns with consequentialist, deontological, and virtue ethics perspectives. AI-GFA aims to empower development teams to proactively address ethical risks by facilitating informed decision-making and promoting a culture of ethical accountability, transparency, and stakeholder involvement to maximise overall utility by considering a wide range of perspectives and potential consequences.},

Recognizing the significance of AI, educators are expected not only to teach about AI but also to utilize AI tools in their teaching, ensuring that their students are equipped with the necessary knowledge to navigate the AI-driven society. Thus, it is important to understand how educators perceive AI. In this study, we explore educators’ perceptions of AI, as well as whether they teach AI, the challenges they face in teaching AI, potential support for teaching AI in the future, and possible differences between Cypriot and international educators. Two online surveys, involving 197 educators, followed by interviews with 10 Cypriot educators were conducted to examine how they perceive AI. The findings revealed a shared conceptualization of AI as “human-like”, intelligent machines, capable of learning and solving problems using data. Notable differences in the definitions of AI emerged between Cypriot educators and their international counterparts. Furthermore, the findings showed that even though educators perceive teaching AI as important, they lack formal training and specialized educational tools on AI, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions and tailored resources.},

Current text-to-audio models offer a novel method of defining sounds, which we aim to render utilizable in a music-production environment. Selected pretrained latent diffusion models, enable the synthesis of playable sounds through textual descriptions, which we incorporated into a digital instrument that integrates with standard music production tools. The resultant user interface not only allows generating but also modifying the sounds by editing model and instrument-specific parameters. We evaluated the applicability of current diffusion models with their parameters as well as the fitness of possible prompts for music production scenarios. Adapting published diffusion model pipelines for integration into the instrument, we facilitate experimentation and exploration of this innovative sound synthesis method. Our findings show that despite facing some limitations in the models' responsiveness to specific music production contexts and the instrument's functionality, the tool allows the development of novel and intriguing soundscapes.

In particular, software engineering has been profoundly affected by the transformative power of disruptive innovations for decades, with a significant impact of technical advancements on social dynamics due to its socio-technical nature. In this article, we reflect on the importance of formulating and addressing research problems in software engineering through a socio-technical lens, thus ensuring a holistic understanding of the complex phenomena in this field. We propose a research playbook with the aim of providing a guide to formulate compelling and socially relevant research questions and to identify the appropriate research strategies for empirical investigations, with an eye on the long-term implications of technologies or their use. We showcase how to apply the research playbook. Firstly, we show how it can be used retrospectively to reflect on a prior disruptive technology, Stack Overflow, and its impact on software development. Secondly, we show how it can be used to question the impact of two current disruptive technologies: AI and AR/VR. Finally, we introduce a specialized GPT model to support the researcher in framing future investigations.

 abstract = {The process of fashion design usually involves sketching, refining, and coloring, with designers drawing inspiration from various images to fuel their creative endeavors. However, conventional image search methods often yield irrelevant results, impeding the design process. Moreover, creating and coloring sketches can be time-consuming and demanding, acting as a bottleneck in the design workflow. In this work, we introduce HAIGEN (Human-AI Collaboration for GENeration), an efficient fashion design system for Human-AI collaboration developed to aid designers. Specifically, HAIGEN consists of four modules. T2IM, located in the cloud, generates reference inspiration images directly from text prompts. With three other modules situated locally, the I2SM batch generates the image material library into a certain designer-style sketch material library. The SRM recommends similar sketches in the generated library to designers for further refinement, and the STM colors the refined sketch according to the styles of inspiration images. Through our system, any designer can perform local personalized fine-tuning and leverage the powerful generation capabilities of large models in the cloud, streamlining the entire design development process. Given that our approach integrates both cloud and local model deployment schemes, it effectively safeguards design privacy by avoiding the need to upload personalized data from local designers. We validated the effectiveness of each module through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments. User surveys also confirmed that HAIGEN offers significant advantages in design efficiency, positioning it as a new generation of aid-tool for designers.},

Despite their potential, these LLMs typically rely on statistical learning methods and often exhibit algebraic inaccuracies in solving standard university-level physics problems. This study explores the use of LLMs in physics courses for N = 91 freshman engineering students over two academic terms (Spring and Fall 2023). Students engaged in AI-assisted activities to solve physics problems and were asked to identify and correct the errors made by the chatbot. The outcomes were compared with those from traditional teaching methods without AI involvement, and no significant difference in student learning gains was found. To assess the impact of AI tools in education, a more detailed approach using pre-test and post-test instruments&nbsp;with control and experimental groups is necessary. Survey results revealed, however, that AI-assisted sessions enhanced student engagement, problem-solving skills, and understanding of physics concepts. Students also indicated a strong preference for AI-assisted activities, citing increased motivation and a firm belief in the educational benefits of using these tools.

We used Gherkin, a domain-specific language that allows non-technical practitioners to define test scenarios using a human-readable syntax. Our findings indicate that using ChatGPT significantly reduces the time required to develop automated test scripts without compromising the reliability of the scripts. Statistical analysis shows a notable reduction in development time for the ChatGPT-assisted group compared to the manual group, with a large effect size.

While Generative AI has a multitude of exciting applications for the fields of writing, coding, and graphic design, its usage to personalize our virtual space has not yet been explored. In this paper, we investigate the application of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) to personalize our virtual spaces and enhance the metaverse experience. To this end, we present a pipeline to enable users to customize their virtual spaces. Moreover, we explore the hardware resources and latency required for personalized spaces, as well as user acceptance of the AI-generated spaces. Comprehensive user studies follow extensive system experiments. Our research evaluates users' perceptions of two generated spaces: panoramic images and 3D virtual spaces. According to our findings, users have shown a great interest in 3D personalized spaces, and the practicality and immersion of 3D space generation tools surpass panoramic space generation tools.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052\% were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.},

Amidst the growing integration of AI in various aspects of life and its ethical implications, understanding AI becomes crucial for effective interaction with AI technologies. The PAILQ-6 emerges in response to the need for an accessible instrument that evaluates general AI literacy without compromising on clarity or depth, suitable for both academic and practical applications. This paper presents the development process of the PAILQ-6, consisting of six items derived from established components of AI literacy, structured as a seven-point Likert scale for easy administration and digital compatibility. The validation study was conducted from data of a gender-balanced sample of 232 UK adults. The article demonstrates the PAILQ-6's reliability and validity through exploratory factor analysis, showing a two-factor structure. The findings reveal the scale's good internal consistency and convergent validity. The study highlights demographic predictors of AI literacy perceptions, indicating a possible gender disparity and the positive influence of higher education on perceived AI competency.},

To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study involving 16 professional designers from the automotive industry. We aimed to identify their challenges with existing GenAI image generation tools in daily design practices. Thematic analysis revealed four key themes: (1) the need for visual input-centric multi-modal interfaces that extend beyond textual prompts, (2) the lack of support for the iterative nature of design processes in GenAI tools, (3) difficulties in controlling prompts to achieve desired outputs, and (4) the significance of incorporating human experiences and emotions into design. Based on our findings, we propose and discuss potential design considerations for enhancing future GenAI image generation tool interfaces.},

@inproceedings{10.1145/3680532.3689592,
 abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has made unprecedented advances in vision language models over the past two years. These advances are largely due to diffusion-based generative models, which are very stable and simple to train. These diffusion models are tasked to learn the underlying unknown distribution of the training data samples. During the generative process, new samples (images) are generated from this unknown high-dimensional distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly effective in drawing samples from complex, high-dimensional distributions. This makes MCMC methods an integral component for both the training and sampling phases of these models, ensuring accurate sample generation.Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques.A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples (images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge, linking these closely related areas of research. Our tutorial aims to provide necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

 abstract = {CG (Computer Graphics) is a popular field of CS (Computer Science), but many students find this topic difficult due to it requiring a large number of skills, such as mathematics, programming, geometric reasoning, and creativity. Over the past few years, researchers have investigated ways to harness the power of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) to improve teaching. In CS, much of the research has focused on introductory computing. A recent study evaluating the performance of an LLM (Large Language Model), GPT-4 (text-only), on CG questions, indicated poor performance and reliance on detailed descriptions of image content, which often required considerable insight from the user to return reasonable results. So far, no studies have investigated the abilities of LMMs (Large Multimodal Models), or multimodal LLMs, to solve CG questions and how these abilities can be used to improve teaching.In this study, we construct two datasets of CG questions requiring varying degrees of visual perception skills and geometric reasoning skills, and evaluate the current state-of-the-art LMM, GPT-4o, on the two datasets. We find that although GPT-4o exhibits great potential in solving questions with visual information independently, major limitations still exist to the accuracy and quality of the generated results. We propose several novel approaches for CG educators to incorporate GenAI into CG teaching despite these limitations. We hope that our guidelines further encourage learning and engagement in CG classrooms.},

However, educators have raised ethical concerns, particularly regarding the adverse effect on students' learning if students simply parrot generative AI-generated content without engaging in critical analysis or original thought. Moreover, there exists the potential of generative AI to perpetuate existing biases in training data. This editorial discusses three major concerns in generative AI use in education and proposes questions (on task-AI fit and people-AI fit) and approaches to address the ethical considerations by adopting five principles of AI ethics. The editorial also discusses developing a classroom AI use policy as one governance mechanism for promoting ethical use of AI. As generative AI technology continues to evolve, so must our educational practices.

However, this integration raises critical concerns about trust and ethics, which are crucial in shaping both the acceptance and effective utilisation of these technologies. There are many reports, articles and papers currently exploring the opportunities and challenges of LLMs in higher education from the perspective of students and educators. However, these papers often focus on specific contexts like in the UK, US or a particular institutions. In this paper, we examine the problems of generative AI in higher education from educator and student perspectives using scientometrics and text analysis to provide an overview of the research landscape, followed by a narrative review and thematic analysis of selected literature. Some findings of this work are: (1) Students and educators found different ways to use generative AI. Students focus more on using it as an assistant (revising and preparing for lectures, helping with homework) and educators as a content production assistant (writing lecture notes, personalising content). Commonalities are that both students and educators use generative AI as an accessibility aid, e.g., to rephrase sentences or explain concepts. (2) The main concerns of higher education regarding generative AI are equity in access, clarity of rules regarding usage, and job displacement.},

 abstract = {Rather than using AI to make art that imitates the work of human artists, we aim to design machines to support human artists in their creative work. However, assisting in creative tasks without getting in the way of the artist’s workflow can be challenging. Since there is no "correct" answer in creative works for the machine to steer towards, the machine must gauge the "goodness" or "badness" of its actions by watching the user’s response. We present our system, ‘Hero’, for eliciting and developing interactions around creative machines, particularly drawing machines. It uses multi-modal information about the user to steer when it should intervene in the creative process. We are using this system in user studies and interviews with artists to understand what modalities they would use to interact with and give feedback to a machine without disrupting their usual sense of creative workflow. This paper outlines this project’s background, Hero’s current system design, ongoing user experiments, and our planned future work to develop a mixed-initiative, multi-modal collaborative machine for creative tasks.

 abstract = {Self-adaptive systems (SASs) are designed to handle changes and uncertainties through a feedback loop with four core functionalities: monitoring, analyzing, planning, and execution. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this article aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI’s within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies.†},

Students may view generative AI as a means to an end of achieving a perfect grade, skipping important elements of the learning process, or they may view it as an opportunity to expand their creative efforts. Faculty may view it as a tool students use to circumvent plagiarism detection, may feel it potentially minimizes the role of faculty in the classroom, or they may view it as an opportunity to avail of a supplement to existing activities and assignments. Ultimately, faculty are faced with maintaining academic integrity and reinforcing the need and importance of the learning process.

A crucial factor for fake news to go viral on social media is that users share such content. Here, we aim to shed light on the sharing behavior of users across human-generated vs. AI-generated fake news. Specifically, we study: (1) What is the perceived veracity of human-generated fake news vs. AI-generated fake news? (2) What is the user's willingness to share human-generated fake news vs. AI-generated fake news on social media? (3) What socio-economic characteristics let users fall for AI-generated fake news? To this end, we conducted a pre-registered, online experiment with N= 988 subjects and 20 fake news from the COVID-19 pandemic generated by GPT-4 vs. humans. Our findings show that AI-generated fake news is perceived as less accurate than human-generated fake news, but both tend to be shared equally. Further, several socio-economic factors explain who falls for AI-generated fake news.},

As AI technologies increasingly influence learning environments, they offer novel opportunities for personalized learning, efficient assessment, and data-driven decision-making. However, these advancements also raise critical ethical questions regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, student autonomy, and the changing roles of educators. This research examines specific use cases of AI in education, analyzing both their potential benefits and drawbacks. By revisiting the philosophical principles of ancient Greek thinkers such as Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato, we discuss how their writings can guide the ethical implementation of AI in modern education. The paper argues that while AI presents significant challenges, a balanced approach informed by classical philosophical thought can lead to an ethically sound transformation of education.

 abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.},

 abstract = {The rapid progression of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has raised significant interest and concern in academia. Instances of students submitting AI-generated assignments prompt investigations into implications for teaching, learning, and academic integrity. Recent publications highlight concerns such as a lack of conceptual understanding, threats to academic integrity, and disruptions to traditional assessment methods. While recognizing benefits like automated scoring and personalized learning, authors stress the responsible use of GenAI, emphasizing the educator's role in guiding students. This commentary identifies opportunities and threats of GenAI in African university contexts. Opportunities include increased operational efficiency, content generation, automated assessment, recognition of accessibility needs, overcoming language barriers, and accelerated research. However, these tools require human correction and cautious consideration of job displacement concerns. Threats encompass job displacement, privacy and security issues, threats to academic integrity, hallucinations/confabulations of GenAI, access and infrastructure challenges, technological overemphasis, lack of customization for local needs and cultural contexts, dependency on external providers, and unaffordable costs. The need for robust guidelines that balance technological advances with traditional teaching methods in African universities is emphasized. Given digital transformation initiatives like the African Union's Agenda 2063 and Botswana's SmartBots strategy, integrating GenAI could shape the future of African tertiary education. Proactive policies should address ethical concerns, ensure access, and make GenAI tools available, requiring a collaborative effort to navigate its impact responsibly.},

This technique if applied in illegal ways will threaten the security of individuals and society, in order to ensure the sustainable development of artificial intelligence technology and reduce its negative impact aspects, this study proposes an innovative detection model that aims to improve the accuracy of deep forgery content detection by combining the advantages of convolutional networks and capsule networks-BIGRU. The research methodology consists of first extracting spatial features of the image using a convolutional neural network (CNN), followed by capturing the positional information of the object using a capsule network, and capturing temporal features between video frames using a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The combined application of these techniques is extensively tested on multiple sample datasets. The experimental results show that the present model outperforms existing mainstream approaches in detecting deeply forged content, which not only proves the effectiveness of the model, but also demonstrates its potential in improving the security performance of AI. Ultimately, this study concludes that the accuracy of deep forgery detection can be significantly improved by comprehensively utilizing CNNs, capsule networks, and GRUs, which provides strong technical support for the healthy development of AI technology.},

 abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has exacerbated the challenges of misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information (MDM) within digital ecosystems. These multi-faceted challenges demand a re-evaluation of the digital information lifecycle and a deep understanding of its social impact. An interdisciplinary strategy integrating insights from technology, social sciences, and policy analysis is crucial to address these issues effectively. This article introduces a three-tiered framework to scrutinize the lifecycle of GenAI-driven content from creation to consumption, emphasizing the consumer perspective. We examine the dynamics of consumer behavior that drive interactions with MDM, pinpoints vulnerabilities in the information dissemination process, and advocates for adaptive, evidence-based policies. Our interdisciplinary methodology aims to bolster information integrity and fortify public trust, equipping digital societies to manage the complexities of GenAI and proactively address the evolving challenges of digital misinformation. We conclude by discussing how GenAI can be leveraged to combat MDM, thereby creating a reflective cycle of technological advancement and mitigation.},

 abstract = {Conceptual design is an essential stage in the design process, and its ultimate success largely depends on designers’ creativity. Both physical and digital prototypes are commonly adopted by designers to support ideation and creativity, providing intuitive perception and rapid iteration, respectively. In recent advancements, large-scale generation models are able to offer data-enabled creativity support by generating high-quality solutions comparable to human designers. This opens up an imaginary space for designers and brings new possibilities for design tools. In this study, we proposed a hybrid prototype method that synergistically combines physical models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the conceptual design stage. Correspondingly, we developed a hybrid prototype system to implement the proposed method. We conducted a comparative user study with 45 designers who completed a design task using the physical prototype method, standalone generative AI and the hybrid prototype method, respectively. Our results verified the effectiveness of the hybrid prototype method and investigated its mechanism in supporting creativity. Finally, we discussed the application value and optimisation space of the hybrid prototype method.},

 abstract = {Design by Contract represents an established, lightweight paradigm for engineering reliable and robust software systems by specifying verifiable expectations and obligations between software components. Due to its laborious nature, developers hardly adopt Design by Contract in practice.    A plethora of research on (semi-)-automated inference to reduce the manual burden has not improved the adoption of so-called code contracts in practice.    This paper examines the potential of Generative AI to automatically generate code contracts in terms of pre- and postconditions for any Java project without requiring any additional auxiliary artifact.    To fine-tune two state-of-the-art Large Language Models, CodeT5 and CodeT5+, we derive a dataset of more than 14k Java methods comprising contracts in form of Java Modeling Language (JML) annotations, and train the models on the task of generating contracts.    We examine the syntactic and semantic validity of the contracts generated for software projects not used in the fine-tuning and find that more than 95\% of the generated contracts are syntactically correct and exhibit remarkably high completeness and semantic correctness.    To this end, our fully automated method sets the stage for future research and eventual broader adoption of Design by Contract in software development practice.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have revolutionized information retrieval and content generation, opening up new opportunities for the e-commerce industry. Alignment learning between small models and parallel corpora cannot meet current needs. The success of ChatGPT demonstrates that large models need to first establish a fundamental understanding, and then utilize high-quality corpora for generation. Having a large model foundation is indispensable. In this paper, we establish a fundamental 10B multimodal model foundation for multimodal generation tasks and propose a scene-based alignment learning approach called conditional sample supervised fine-tuning for downstream generation tasks. Meanwhile, diffusion models are known to be vulnerable to outliers in training data. To address this, we utilize an alternative diffusion loss function that preserves the high quality of generated data like the original squared L2 loss while being robust to outliers.In practical test sets, the multimodal foundation fully demonstrates its alignment and comprehension abilities for graphic and textual content. Additionally, conditional fine-tuning and the design of the loss function significantly enhance the quality of generated content. The quality rate of images has increased by 34.3 percentage points, and prompt control has improved by 19.8 percentage points. The application of our framework in Baidu Search Ads has led to significant revenue growth. For instance, ads with generated image creatives have achieved a 29\% higher click-through rate (CTR), resulting in a daily consumption of 3 million yuan.},

This study discusses seven strategic factors, including policy guarantee, stakeholder collaboration, financial capability, and public demands, information security, data availability, and AI infrastructure, and identifies their configurations which lead to a high smart city performance via the adoption of AI. A theoretical model is developed to understand smart city practice in 31 capital cities in the mainland of China. The findings reveal the complexity of AI adoption in smart cities from a configurational perspective and indicate that these factors do not work in isolation, but in combination with others to promote AI adoption in smart cities. Understanding the configurational relationships of these factors can help smart city strategists in their planning and policymaking relating to the development of smart cities.},

 abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, generative artificial intelligence has shown strong application potential in various fields, and low code development has become a popular choice for quickly building application systems due to its efficient and easy-to-use characteristics. With the continuous updates and iterations of web front-end development technology, how to improve learners' practical abilities and development efficiency has become an important issue in the field of vocational education. Therefore, we have designed an innovative web front-end development course training platform that combines the automation generation ability of generative artificial intelligence and the fast construction advantage of low code development. In platform design, we fully utilize the automated generation capability of generative artificial intelligence to achieve intelligent generation and layout optimization of front-end page elements. At the same time, with the help of the visual programming interface and component-based development methods of low code development platforms, the front-end development process is simplified, the technical threshold is lowered, and students can focus more on the implementation of business logic and creative expression.},

Not because there is no potential for harm from AI systems and not because AI systems should not be regulated, but because “Artificial Intelligence” is a vaguely defined label that is neither suitable nor necessary for comprehensive regulation of technological risks. Instead of regulating a particular set of approaches and algorithms, lawmakers should focus and double down on regulating high-risk applications of software, independent of whether it is labelled as AI or not.},

These methodologies involve abstractive summarization, extracting the core content from an input text and transforming it into natural sentences. Unlike fact-based documents, opinion-based documents require a thorough analysis of sentiment and understanding of the writer’s intention. However, existing models do not explicitly consider these factors. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel text summarization model that is specifically designed for opinion-based documents. Specifically, we identify the sentiment distribution of the entire document and train the summarization model to focus on major opinions that conform to the intended message while randomly masking minor opinions. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing summarization models in summarizing opinion-based documents, effectively capturing and highlighting the main opinions in the generated abstractive summaries.},

However, little is known about how these tools impact student help-seeking patterns and peer interactions. This short paper investigates GenAI tools, help-seeking preferences and the importance of peer support among first-year software engineering students (n=94). Our responses show that 50\% of the students use GenAI tools as the primary source of help-seeking, and 43\% report that using ChatGPT reduces their need to interact with peers. However, students generally recognize the importance of social interaction and peer support for their learning. We use these duality findings to extend previous recommendations for integrating generative AI in education by providing new recommendations on how educators can support help-seeking and peer support in the age of GenAI.},

From all of these, we distilled our findings in the form of 5 insights.

However, learning SDLC concepts presents unique challenges, such as the need for effective collaboration, real-time interaction, and access to diverse skill sets represented in software development teams. To address these problems, we present DevCoach, a generative AI powered multi-agent system designed to support students learning the SDLC. DevCoach allows students to interact with generative AI agents simulating the different roles in the software development team, engaging in tasks across different phases of SDLC. Through a user study (n = 20), we evaluate the system's effectiveness in enhancing learning, impact on SDLC deliverables, and support for Community of Inquiry (CoI) elements necessary for effective and supportive learning environments. Our results reveal that students using DevCoach achieved significantly higher learning gains and improved task completion rates across all SDLC phases. The system also supports CoI elements, particularly perceived social presence. Participants also lauded the immediate context-aware feedback, interactive learning environment, and diverse expertise provided by the roles within the multi-agent team.

 abstract = {Software development activities must adhere to industry, national, and/or international regulatory standards to ensure security, safety, and other important properties in high-stakes, regulated domains, such as healthcare, automotive, and aerospace. These software standards are often codified via multiple documents, ranging from specific requirements to general guidance. Software developers must demonstrate—and regulatory authorities must then verify—the completeness and consistency between the software artifacts and the software regulatory documents. Detecting regulatory document incompleteness, inconsistencies, and/or discrepancies (DIID) with respect to software artifacts is important for both developers and regulators because they indicate potential non-conformance and/or software regulatory risk.DIID detection is currently a human-intensive activity where people learn the standards and then review or search software artifacts to find or detect potential issues. This tedious and error-prone manual process is even more challenging with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that create frequent software updates. In addition, software artifacts (such as requirements or architecture documents) and software standards also change as the software is maintained, requiring ongoing manual reviews and revisions.Generative AI can accelerate DIID detection for different documents and data sources. This paper explores how generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), can accelerate DIID detection in software artifacts, particularly when comparing trusted documents like safety standards with software development artifacts. Integrating LLMs into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to detect DIID can improve specific development activities, as well as enable transformative opportunities by accelerating end-to-end SDLC workflows and regulatory compliance. Current LLM benchmarks and testing frameworks do not sufficiently test for detecting DIID and require extension to adequately and consistently detect DIID across multiple SDLC activities. This position paper describes how LLMs can accelerate software assurance processes and ensure greater compliance with industry standards and government regulatory requirements.},

While these tools promise to enhance programmer productivity, their impact on Time-Constrained Coding Challenges (TCCs), such as competitive programming, hackathons, and technical interviews remains poorly understood. TCCs are fundamental to both educational assessment and professional recruitment in software engineering. Integrating GenAI tools in these environments raises critical questions about skill development, assessment validity, and the nature of programming expertise. Current research lacks a systematic understanding of how GenAI tools influence programmer performance and learning outcomes in time-constrained environments. This gap is particularly concerning as educational institutions and industry organizations struggle to establish guidelines for GenAI use in TCCs. Without proper frameworks for integration, there are risks of: (1) Over-reliance on AI, potentially compromising fundamental skill development, and (2) Misalignment between traditional evaluation metrics and emerging co-intelligent programming practices.

Poetry is no exception, as even general-purpose language models now routinely generate convincing emulations of poetic form. While researchers have closely examined such machine-generated poetry, few have studied human-AI collaboration in poetry writing from a posthuman perspective. Through semi-structured interviews with ten participants in an AI English poetry contest and an analysis of their dialogs with AIs, we summarize the affordances and challenges of such collaborative practice using posthumanism as a lens. We then expose interesting tensions, for example, between human self-expression and the diminished (or relocated) agency that AI collaboration often entails. This collaborative, yet often adversarial, process provides insights into the nature of the posthuman condition as regards creative collaboration between human and machine.},

Generative video is rapidly evolving and delivering higher quality outputs. While video generation models have potential for film-making and content creation, they lack controllability for creative expression: viable videos can require hundreds of unsuccessful attempts. To understand this emergent practice, and due to the constant evolution of models and limited number of early adopters, I explored Generative Rotoscoping over 12 months and created AI workflows leading to over 40,000 video/image files examining a variety of models and techniques including: structural guidance, frame consistency, image referencing and masks, compositing, among others.

While generative artificial intelligence ignited creativity, it brought authenticity, originality, and tensions with ethics. These concerns are addressed through themes such as attribution transparency, the ethics of relying on non-human solutions and balancing inspiration versus imitation.

@inproceedings{10.1145/3698061.3742799,
 abstract = {The emergence of generative and procedural art marks a fundamental shift in creative practice, where the traditional “art-object” (painting, sculpture…) transforms into an “art-subject” paradigm that challenges temporal assumptions about design and futurity. As computational systems evolve beyond mere extensions of human memory and processing capacity, they demonstrate a unique form of creativity that can be characterized as “imachination”—a term that captures the machine’s distinctive approach to creative synthesis, which parallels yet diverges from normative human imagination.This transformation necessitates a reconceptualization of artistic skills and creative agency. While traditional artistic mastery centered on manual dexterity and technical craftsmanship (tekhn\`{e} vs tekhn\`{e}), contemporary practice reveals that manual execution may have restricted the creative process to a temporally and spatially contained form or reification. We may consider that, until the 19th century, the art-object has restrained the canonic practice to using hands as a constraint imposed by the inability to directly project mental concepts through the eyes. Assuming with Leonardo that “la pittura\`{e} cosa mentale”, the art-object translates into the interruption, at a highly specific moment of the mental process putting a full stop to its dynamic expression. Temporality becomes a good way to understand the outcomes of generative media. While the traditional practice focusses on the trace left by the brush stroke or the chisel print in marble, the evidence of “what happened” frozen in time (Roland Barthes’ “\c{C}a a\'{e}t\'{e}” (in La chambre claire), reversely, generative and processual artworks are designed for “what they will come”. Metaphorically we could say that one is the hundred millions years old petrified tree, the other is the seed of promises, thoroughly designed by the artist to open up fields of virtuality. The temporal switch is striking and it doesn’t affect only the artwork, but also the artist forced to reconsider one’s practice.The advent of collective (Pierre Levy) and connective (Derrick de Kerckhove) intelligence introduces creativity models based on unlimited repositories of historical references. This creates a fundamental paradox: we expect creativity to forge new pathways while simultaneously grounding it in comprehensive analysis of existing patterns. The limitations of traditional IQ-based assessments of logical-mathematical intelligence become apparent in this context, neurotypical thinking is a highly normative conception of human thought, and neurodivergent thinking patterns—characterized by rapid, non-linear connections across conceptual spaces—may provide more accurate models for understanding how imachination operates.During this talk, I will present original case studies exploring the conceptual territory of human-machine creative interweaving. Through the definition of conceptual building blocks such as iterative curatorship, egonomy, extended serendipity, critical fusion, artificial intentionality, and maieutic engines, this essay shed light on how human creative role will evolve, not competing with artificial intelligence, but through new forms of human-machine symbiosis that expand the boundaries of creative possibilities, while presenting to the human kind a magic mirror to see its true colors.The investigation draws upon the ancient concept of clinamen–the random disruption of the flow of particles that generates diversity in atomic systems–as a metaphor for understanding how creative divergence functions in both human neurodivergence and artificial intelligence systems. By following these “lines of steepest slope” through the latent spaces of machine learning, we can better comprehend the emerging landscape of augmented creativity and its implications for future artistic practice.},

We analysed the current research on energy consumption of AI algorithms and its improvements, which gave us a starting literature corpus of 2,688 papers that we identified as Green AI with a software perspective. We structure this corpus into Green IN AI and Green BY AI, which led us to discover that only 36 of them could be considered Green IN AI. After some quick insights about Green BY AI, we then introduce our main contribution: a systematic mapping of Green IN AI. We provide an in-depth analysis of the AI models that we observed during the mapping, and what solutions have been proposed for improving their energy efficiency. We also analyse the energy evaluation methodologies employed in Green IN AI, discovering that most papers opt for a software-based energy estimation approach and 27\% of all papers do not document their methodology. We finish by synthetising our insights from the mapping into a Decalogue of Good Practices for Green AI.},

The conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. Over the years, the conference has evolved and is now one of the most relevant venues for discussion of the highest quality research on how learning and teaching can be transformed by technology.The aim of L@S is to address real-world educational challenges and simultaneously contribute to a fundamental understanding of human learning. Together, our goal is to investigate how data and technology can be leveraged to create more responsible and effective learning experiences for all learners across the globe. The theme of L@S 2025 is Learning Synergies @ Scale. As technology continues to reshape education, at the L@S 2025 conference we explore how generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its new possibilities can be leveraged to better support learning across the lifespan. L@S 2025 explores the impact of AI on learning with an emphasis on scalability and the broader impact of technological advances in learning environments. As a community we address the challenges of applying scalable, technology-driven solutions in both structured institutional environments and dynamic, self-directed learning communities, especially those that provide actionable insights for equitable and effective adaptive learning experiences.

 abstract = {Investigation of students’ perceptions and opinions on the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education is a topic gaining much interest. Studies addressing this are typically conducted with large heterogeneous groups, at one moment in time. However, how students perceive and use GenAI tools can potentially depend on many factors, including their background knowledge, familiarity with the tools, and the learning goals and policies of the courses they are taking. In this study we explore how students following computing courses use GenAI for programming-related tasks across different programs and courses: Bachelor and Master, in courses in which learning programming is the learning goal, courses that require programming as a means to achieve another goal, and in courses in which programming is optional, but can be useful. We are also interested in changes over time, since GenAI capabilities are changing at a fast pace, and users are adopting GenAI increasingly. We conducted three consecutive surveys (fall ‘23, winter ‘23, and spring ‘24) among students of all computing programs of a large European research university. We asked questions on the use in education, ethics, and job prospects, and we included specific questions on the (dis)allowed use of GenAI tools in the courses they were taking at the time. We received 264 responses, which we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, to find out how students have employed GenAI tools across 59 different computing courses, and whether the opinion of an average student about these tools evolves over time. Our study contributes to the emerging discussion of how to differentiate GenAI use across different courses, and how to align its use with the learning goals of a computing course.},

 abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence tools (Generative AI), such as ChatGPT, allow users to interact with them in intuitive ways (e.g., conversational) and receive (mostly) good-quality answers. In education, such systems can support students’ learning objectives by providing accessible explanations and examples even when students pose vague queries. But, they also encourage undesired help-seeking behaviors, such as by providing solutions to the students’ homework. Therefore, it is important to better understand how students approach such tools and the potential issues such approaches might present for the learners.In this paper, we present a case study for understanding student-AI collaboration to solve programming tasks in the CS1 introductory programming course. To this end, we recruited a gender-balanced majority non-white set of 15 CS1 students at the University of Houston, a large public university in the US. We observed them solving programming tasks. We used a mixed-method approach to study their interactions as they tackled Python programming tasks, focusing on when and why they used ChatGPT for problem-solving. We analyze and classify the questions submitted by the 15 participants to ChatGPT. Additionally, we analyzed user interaction patterns, their reactions to ChatGPT’s responses, and the potential impacts of Generative AI on their perception of self-efficacy.Our results suggest that, in about a third of the cases, the student attempted to complete the task by submitting the full description of the tasks to ChatGPT without making any effort on their own. We also observed that few students verified their solutions. We discuss the potential implications of these results.},

How to predict stock price effectively has become the object of many scholars' research. In recent years, with the swift advancement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), their performance in the field of stock price prediction has attracted wide attention. This study proposes an improved Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) stock price prediction model, with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) as a generator. Compared with traditional GANs, the choice of GRU ensures that improved WGAN-GP has excellent prediction accuracy while being stable in training, and the inclusion of Residual Neural Network in the discriminator significantly improves the predictive performance of the model. In addition, Bull/Bear Ratio (BR) is introduced into the model as an input feature, which can well reflect investor sentiment.},

But to what extent is the technology already in use? Our survey of UK public service professionals (in education, health, social work, and emergency services) seeks to answer this question. We find that use of generative AI is widespread: 45\% of respondents were aware of colleagues using generative AI, while 22\% use it themselves. Respondents were positive about its potential to enhance their efficiency and reduce their bureaucratic workload. For example, those working in the health service thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop by the equivalent of one day per week, an enormous potential impact. Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61\%) in generative AI and a low fear of replacement (16\%). However, only a minority of respondents (32\%) felt like there was clear guidance on generative AI usage in their workplaces. In other words, it is clear that generative AI is already coming into the public sector, but uptake is happening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines. The UK’s public sector urgently needs to develop more systematic methods for taking advantage of the technology.},

One such tool, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), is rapidly permeating into people's daily lives and is considered to have the potential to reshape our society. While private organizations are spending huge amounts of money on ChatGPT, its usage in the public domain is still driven by its open access and simple functionality. This study draws on the key concepts of Effective Use theory—Transparent Interaction, Representational Fidelity, Informed Action, and Learning and Adaptation—to examine ChatGPT's current state of diffusion in four public sector domains: transportation, healthcare, agriculture, and law. We find that transparent interaction is better in transportation, agriculture, and law than healthcare; representational fidelity presents a complex picture, whereas informed action has been positive across domains; and learning and adaptation is an ongoing need. We conclude with various suggestions related to research and policy toward boosting GenAI's adoption. We suggest that governments invest resources and develop new regulatory frameworks considering the specific context and use cases for leveraging the enormous potential of GenAI tools in the public domain.},

 abstract = {As deep learning technology in computer science develops, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has shown great potential in automated essay scoring (AES). Prompts and time are important factors which may influence the performance of GenAI. The study selected 52 English argumentative essays, designed five different prompts, chooses two different time points, and then utilized ChatGPT 4 to explore the effects of prompts and time on AES by GenAI. Besides, possible reasons for large difference between human and GenAI score were discussed.For different prompts, results show that the one-shot prompt performs better in AES compared with the other four prompts. It provides background information and a scoring example to ChatGPT. The scores generated by it do not significantly differ from the human scores. They significantly and positively correlate with human scores (ρ = 0.424). The exact-plus-adjacent agreement (EPAA) rate for one-shot prompt scores reaches 69.23\%. For scores generated at different points in time, results reveal that although there is still a significant difference between scores generated after one week and human scores, the ChatGPT-Human EPAA rate becomes higher and the absolute value of mean score difference is smaller.Based on the analysis of selected essays, the major reason for large GenAI-Human score difference is that ChatGPT evaluates essays from limited perspectives to give its score, while human raters can comprehensively assess the quality of an essay. What's more, ChatGPT cannot keep the same scoring criteria during the rating process.The study aims to help people understand how to interact with GenAI more efficiently and take advantage of GenAI to meet the practical needs.},

 abstract = {This study delves into the impact of artificial intelligence on students’ learning.The paper pioneers the use of k-means classification to reduce the dimensionality of features before the classification process, which minimizes redundant information and computational overhead. This step is not commonly found in prior research.Firstly, a random forest model is established with “whether AI assistance was used to complete the paper” as the output, and various features as inputs. The analysis of the predictive accuracy when changing input features reveals the degree of influence of each feature on using AI to complete the paper. After feature selection, the remaining 6 features can still effectively predict the use of AI to complete the paper, indicating the representativeness of the extracted indicators. Subsequently, the PCA-K-means algorithm is employed to classify the use of artificial intelligence. PCA algorithm is used for dimensionality reduction of the extracted features to better characterize students’ use of AI. Three representative variables are selected, and the contribution of each feature is computed based on the factor loading matrix. Finally, the K-means algorithm is used to classify students based on the three-dimensional features, showing that students can be effectively classified into 2 categories. The results indicate that the majority of students support the use of AI technology to enhance their abilities, although some students may only intend to use AI to cope with exams and similar tasks.},

The study highlights the potential of ChatGPT in university teacher education, where it can offer intelligent teaching assistance, personalized learning resources, and instructional support. However, the integration of ChatGPT also raises challenges, such as redefining the authority of knowledge and altering the dynamics of the teacher-student relationship.

To address this technical problem, from the perspective of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content, modeling methods such as support vector machines, random search, and machine learning for key performance indicators (KPI) in business decision-making systems have been proposed. The system integrates with large language models, driving the generative efficiency and accuracy of KPI data cleaning, feature extraction, and model optimization training. Using MATLAB to conduct predictive simulation experiments on the integrated system, compared to general information systems for KPIs that do not utilize large language models or Artificial Intelligence Generated Content, the volume of reference data for business decision-making based on large language models increased by 93.61 times, and decision-making efficiency improved by 36.59\%, indicating that the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content modeling scheme for business decision-making systems based on operational KPIs is feasible.},

However, the fine line between persuasion and coercion raises significant ethical concerns, which current literature only superficially addresses. This paper aims to deepen the understanding of factors influencing the ethical perception of persuasive technologies through a systematic literature review of 17 journal articles. The selected studies were analyzed using content analysis to identify key ethical factors. The findings indicate that factors such as autonomy, consent, data privacy, transparency, and addictive design strategies significantly influence users’ ethical perceptions across multiple application domains. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies or AI agents, particularly applications like argumentative chatbots and storytelling robots, exhibit the highest number of ethical considerations. The study also notes thematic overlaps among many ethical factors, with the context and use case impacting ethical perceptions. Based on these results, this paper offers design recommendations and suggestions for the design of ethical persuasive technology applications.},

Moreover, making students realize the importance and benefits of refactoring is also challenging. To address this complexity, we introduce a refactoring teaching method based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), incorporating single-loop and double-loop learning principles, focusing on fostering deeper and critical learning. We used ChatGPT, a GAI-based tool, and conducted an eight-week mixed-methods study involving 23 computer science undergraduate students. The study involved applying four distinct projects extracted from GitHub, where participants were tasked with identifying code smells and performing the necessary refactoring to improve code quality. The primary focus was on identifying both the positive and negative aspects of the method, as well as delineating the computational thinking characteristics developed during the process. The results indicate that the use of ChatGPT facilitated the learning of refactoring, contributing to the development of numerous computational thinking skills, especially problem formulation, decomposition, and abstraction. Thus, this paper contributes a GAI-based teaching method along with evidence on how it helps students develop refactoring skills.},

 abstract = {Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has gained significant attention, especially in AI-powered autonomous and adaptive systems (AASs). However, a discernible disconnect exists among research efforts across different communities. The machine learning community often overlooks “explaining to whom,” while the human-computer interaction community has examined various stakeholders with diverse explanation needs without addressing which XAI methods meet these requirements. Currently, no clear guidance exists on which XAI methods suit which specific stakeholders and their distinct needs. This hinders the achievement of the goal of XAI: providing human users with understandable interpretations. To bridge this gap, this article presents a comprehensive XAI roadmap. Based on an extensive literature review, the roadmap summarizes different stakeholders, their explanation needs at different stages of the AI system lifecycle, the questions they may pose, and existing XAI methods. Then, by utilizing stakeholders’ inquiries as a conduit, the roadmap connects their needs to prevailing XAI methods, providing a guideline to assist researchers and practitioners to determine more easily which XAI methodologies can meet the specific needs of stakeholders in AASs. Finally, the roadmap discusses the limitations of existing XAI methods and outlines directions for future research.},

 abstract = {Prompt and sufficient feedback is essential for students' academic learning since it enables them to review their learning techniques and improve their areas of weakness. Nevertheless, delivering personalised feedback to every student continues to be difficult&nbsp;for teachers due to its demanding and time-intensive nature. While automated feedback systems are available, their primary focus is providing feedback on a single subject, and most of them utilise statistical analysis or traditional machine learning techniques to provide feedback. Moreover, no feedback model utilises the same criteria to generate text-based feedback for more than one subject. Generative artificial intelligence (GEN AI) has recently made incredible progress, and large language models (LLMs) can retain the context from the vast amount of text. Hence, this research presents a framework that employs an innovative technique to offer text-based feedback to students in different fields of study. This framework employs two LLMs, one for generating the feedback and another for categorising it into separate subjects using suitable headings for structural organising. Consequently, the output produced by this technology corresponds to the original tone of the teacher.},

In contrast, moral rights allow the creators to be acknowledged and to take certain actions to preserve and protect the integrity of their works. Both rights are conventionally granted to human and legal entities. However, the massive advancement of AI challenges the essential presumption that technology is merely a device in the hands of humans in the creation process of Work. This paper examines several legal issues and problems concerning the economic and moral rights of AI-generated works using the juridical normative approach from the perspective of Indonesian Copyright Law. The result shows that the framework of Indonesia's copyright law is based on the principle of human authorship, therefore, moral rights can only be granted to human(s) and economic rights can only be granted to legal subjects acknowledged by Indonesian Law: human and legal entity. Although the authorship and ownership of AI for copyrighted work is contentious under Indonesian Laws, the limited legal personality of AI could potentially artifice as the preventive measures on several problems concerning legal standing by enabling legal subject (human or legal entity) to act behalf of AI to exercise their rights and obligation both based on regulative approach and procedural approach.},

But at the same time, the application of artificial intelligence in the teaching process in colleges and universities is not mature, and there are still many problems. In this context, it has become very urgent to explore how to efficiently use artificial intelligence technology to contribute to the higher education in China. This paper introduces the development process of AI and its application in colleges and universities, then analyzes the obstacles of AI when applied in higher education, and finally proposes specific application strategies for artificial intelligence to empower new teaching and learning models in universities. It is hoped that the research of this paper can improve the application of artificial intelligence in the teaching of universities in China.},

By leveraging the strengths of both, a synergy between the two can achieve integrated intelligence. The collaboration between AI and teachers in teaching addresses the shortcomings of relying solely on either AI or human teachers, forming a complex system that combines their respective advantages. Therefore, it is crucial to clarify the futures of AI and teacher for collaborative teaching. Additionally, it discusses four types of collaborative processes supported by AI-teacher teaching systems, analyzing how data circulation and utilization can be enhanced through the four stages of data production, data transformation, data application, and data feedback. Finally, a Chinese language class supported by AI-teacher collaboration was conducted and implemented in a base school in a certain city for sixth-grade students, to analyze the key elements and operational mechanisms in the human-machine collaborative classroom, providing theoretical and practical references for AI-teacher collaborative teaching.},

 abstract = {When graduates of computing degree programs enter the software industry, they will most likely join teams working on legacy code bases developed by people other than themselves. In these so-called brownfield software development settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences undergraduate students’ programming performance, behaviors, and understanding when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10 undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 34.9\% faster (p &lt; 0.05) and made 50.0\% more solution progress (p &lt; 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover, our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 10.6\% less time manually writing code (p &lt; 0.05), and 11.6\% less time conducting web searches (p &lt; 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that leverage GenAI assistants’ benefits while fostering reflection on how and why GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks. Complete study results and analysis are presented at ghcopilot-icer.github.io.},

 abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) has revolutionized software engineering (SE) by automating tasks across design, coding, and testing [1] [2]. Tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot streamline code generation, architectural modeling, debugging, and test-case creation [3] [4]. Despite their rapid adoption in industry, the pedagogical implications of these tools in computing education have not been systematically examined. This study solves the existing gap by conducting a comprehensive benchmarking study of Gen-AI tools across four core SE phases— design documentation, feature implementation, debugging support, and testing — to address two research questions:RQ1: What strengths and limitations do Gen-AI tools exhibit in each phase?RQ2: How can insights from benchmarking inform effective integration of Gen-AI into SE curricula?To answer these questions, a diverse set of Gen-AI tools is evaluated, ranging from design-focused assistants such as Lucidchart, Mermaid.js and UIzard; implementation-oriented systems including GitHub Copilot, TabNine, Codeium and Supermaven; debugging supports like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet; and testing frameworks such as Testim, Mabl and Applitools—while also surveying emerging platforms (as of summer 2024) like Replit, Postman, Visily, Gemini, Eraser.io and others. For each tool and development phase, we applied phase-specific metrics: in design documentation, we assessed diagram accuracy, completeness, user effort, and IDE integration; in feature implementation, we measured pattern-based code generation quality, code-completion effectiveness, refactoring robustness, and UI/UX scaffolding; in debugging, we evaluated error-detection accuracy, hallucination rates, and clarity of explanatory feedback; and in testing, we examined test-case relevance and defect-detection coverage. Across all phases, we tracked prompt engineering complexity as a key mediating factor influencing tool performance.Our evaluation reveals speed-fidelity trade-offs: Code-completion assistants accelerate boilerplate generation but demand manual oversight to ensure cross-file consistency and manage higher-order abstractions; diagramming tools can produce precise UML models with minimal effort— but at the cost of iterative prompt refinement for complex cases; LLM debuggers deliver context-sensitive fixes yet suffer from nontrivial hallucination rates; testing generators exhibit wide variance in edge-case coverage. On average, tools needed 2.4 prompt iterations for usable diagrams and 1.5 prompts for bug fixes, underscoring the human effort in guiding AI.We recommend a scaffolded framework for integrating Gen-AI into SE education by: embedding AI tools into hands-on assignments, to explore tasks in a controlled context; by structuring small team projects in which one subgroup uses AI assistants while the other completes the same tasks manually (covering design, implementation, debugging and testing) to surface contrasts in workflow, tool strengths, and human reasoning; by requiring students to maintain a reflective journal documenting their AI usage and prompt-engineering strategies, fostering metacognitive insight into how tool inputs shape outputs; and by equipping learners with decision making criteria, teaching them to evaluate AI assistants according to task fit- preparing them to leverage AI responsibly across SE phases in its evolving landscape.},

 abstract = {This poster reports on the differences in perceptions concerning academic dishonesty and the misuse of resources in college from the perspectives of students, teaching assistants (TAs), and instructors in Computer Science (CS). Dishonesty has been a topic of interest in the CS education community, with efforts addressing how to detect and prevent it [1, 2, 6, 7, 8]. With the presence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its increased use in recent years, studying all actors’ perspectives on dishonesty in regard to generative AI becomes critical to promote guidelines and strategies for curricular design in CS [4, 5], aligning those who teach and those who learn towards a common ethical ground. This led us to explore the following research questions with a specific emphasis on artificial intelligence in mind:(1)RQ1: How do students, instructors, and teaching assistants respond to scenarios suggesting academic dishonesty in the CS classroom?(2)RQ2: What reasons do students, instructors, and teaching assistants in CS consider may lead someone toward academic dishonesty in the CS classroom?We surveyed 538 undergraduate students, 21 TAs, and six Computer Science (CS) instructors at a large Southeastern U.S. institution. Students and TAs were part of two undergraduate CS courses. Responses were gathered via an online questionnaire that featured 13 multiple-choice questions on whether the participant thought particular situations fell most closely within “serious cheating,” “trivial cheating,” or “no cheating”–questions adapted from the work by Ozment et al. [3]; one open-ended question on the reasons the participant considered why someone might cheat in the CS classroom; and demographic questions. This poster focuses specifically on participants’ responses to the open-ended question, via a thematic analysis to identify recurring categories (i.e., themes) and assess the affinity of participants’ responses within each theme. Subgroups were participants’ demographics and backgrounds.Our findings suggest that all participants have diverse perspectives. Instructors generally referred to "Grade Pressure" and "Laziness" as the top two reasons behind dishonesty, while TAs and students emphasized "Prerequisite Knowledge" and "Time Management" as the main contributing factors. These findings suggest a dichotomy among actors involved in the learning processes happening in the CS classroom.Our work underscores the need for awareness and support strategies in curricular initiatives within the CS Ed community to help prevent dishonesty and promote student success in their computing disciplines. A clear disconnect between instructor expectations and student perceptions encourages clearer communication in the classroom and is a ripe avenue for further study.},

In this paper, we will explore the application areas of AI in cultural industry supply chain management, analyse the benefits and challenges it brings, and look forward to the future development trend of the integration of AI and supply chain. Traditional supply chain management methods often require a large amount of manpower to manage and monitor due to the lack of intelligence and automation. This not only increases the operating costs for the development of cultural and creative industries, but also may adversely affect the development of cultural industries due to poor information transmission and errors caused by human factors. With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, these problems are gradually being solved. Through the application of artificial intelligence technology, the intelligence and automation of supply chain management can be realised, and the reliance on human resources can be reduced. The application of artificial intelligence technology in supply chain management has great potential. It can effectively solve the problems of traditional management methods and improve the competitiveness and operational efficiency of cultural industry development.

 abstract = {Audio-visual speech synthesis (AVSS) is a rapidly gaining prominence in artificial intelligence (AI) due to its widespread applications. AVSS refers to generating the audio-visual speech of a target speaker from the audio input of a source speaker, while preserving the speech content. The sequential steps of the AVSS process include voice conversion (VC) for altering vocal characteristics from the source to the target speaker and audio-visual synthesis (AVS) to generate a video stream from the converted speech of the target speaker. However, with the progressive development of deep generative models, the domain of AVSS remains relatively unexplored. The existing literature predominantly focuses on autoencoder-based AVSS models, potentially limiting their ability to capture the diversity of the vocal features and also synthesize the realistic video output. This paper introduces a novel AVSS approach utilizing a generative adversarial network (GAN) model, enriched with a capsule network (Caps-Net) architecture to effectively capture relevant input speech features and produce more natural audio-visual output. The proposed framework is trained and tested on VoxCeleb2 and LRS3-TED datasets and the experimental outcomes exhibit the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.},

 abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is fundamentally changing the ways of working and blurring the boundaries between human and machine-generated contents. While there is an increasing interest in the adoption of GAI systems, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, there are also serious concerns about the copyright of the contents—the inputs or generated as outputs by the GAI systems. Such concerns need to be identified and assessed to ensure the ethical and responsible use of GAI systems. Thus, this article aims to address the key research challenge: “how to identify and assess GAI system's copyright concerns”? In response, we propose the development of a Copyright Risk Checker (CRC) Tool. This tool has been formulated and evaluated using a recognised design science research methodology, drawing on an analysis of 10 legal cases across Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. The CRC Tool has undergone evaluation through an experimental scenario, and the results suggest that it is suitable for conducting an indicative copyright risk check of GAI systems. The outcomes of this preliminary assessment can be further examined by expert legal advisors for an in-depth analysis. The development of the CRC Tool provides a foundation for continued research and advancement in this significant area of study.},

 abstract = {Typeface design plays a vital role in graphic and communication design. Different typefaces are suitable for different contexts and can convey different emotions and messages. Typeface design still relies on skilled designers to create unique styles for specific needs. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been applied to typeface generation, but these methods face challenges due to the high annotation requirements of typeface generation datasets, which are difficult to obtain. Furthermore, machine-generated typefaces often fail to meet designers’ specific requirements, as dataset annotations limit the diversity of the generated typefaces. In response to these limitations in current typeface generation models, we propose an alternative approach to the task. Instead of relying on dataset-provided annotations to define the typeface style vector, we introduce a transformer-based language model to learn the mapping between a typeface style description and the corresponding style vector. We evaluated the proposed model using both existing and newly created style descriptions. Results indicate that the model can generate high-quality, patent-free typefaces based on the input style descriptions provided by designers.

 abstract = {The advent of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of information technology. With AIGC, it can be effortless to generate high-quality data that is challenging for the public to distinguish. Nevertheless, the proliferation of generative data across cyberspace brings security and privacy issues, including privacy leakages of individuals and media forgery for fraudulent purposes. Consequently, both academia and industry begin to emphasize the trustworthiness of generative data, successively providing a series of countermeasures for security and privacy. In this survey, we systematically review the security and privacy on generative data in AIGC, particularly for the first time analyzing them from the perspective of information security properties. Specifically, we reveal the successful experiences of state-of-the-art countermeasures in terms of the foundational properties of privacy, controllability, authenticity, and compliance, respectively. Finally, we show some representative benchmarks, present a statistical analysis, and summarize the potential exploration directions from each of these properties.},

The goal is to develop new types of devices or programs that can recognize, analyze, and diagnose as humans do. The initial application of artificial intelligence (AI) was in the field of medical imaging for the automatic detection of lung nodules in X-ray and computed tomography (CT) techniques. Malignant pulmonary nodules are often associated with primary lung tumors and metastatic lung lesions, so the screening, diagnosis and differentiation of pulmonary nodules are very important for the subsequent treatment of lung diseases.},

Since then, researchers and educators have been experimenting with Gen AI tools to explore their possibilities in various fields. In education, the use of Gen AI in assessment is a research focus. To reveal the research patterns in this field, the study employed Vosviewer and CiteSpace to analyze 816 papers in the Web of Science (WOS) database published between 2019 and 2024. The annual publications surged during the period of 2023-2024 due to the release of higher versions of Gen AI tools such as ChatGpt 3. Researchers in the United States, United Kingdom and China engage most actively in the field. American and Hong Kong universities are particularly productive. However, the collaboration between institutions and authors still needs to be enhanced. Highly influential journals such as Nature and famous medical journals such as JMIR Medical Education and Cureus Journal of Medical sciences are most frequently cited. The analysis of co-occurrence keywords and keyword clusters identified two research areas: responding to the academic integrity issue with the use of Gen AI in assessment and exploring the valuable use of Gen AI in assessments in higher education especially medical education. Future research could explore the design of innovative or alternative assessments and the use of Gen AI tools in interactive and game-based assessment creation, marking and feedback giving.},

The education quality evaluation system combines big data and artificial intelligence technology, uses artificial intelligence model construction, analyzes the collected teaching quality evaluation index data, and generates objective results for education quality evaluation. The teaching quality evaluation of higher education teaching quality is a more complex system engineering. Its remarkable characteristics are complex levels, strong structure, large amount of information processed, and need to consume a lot of manpower, material and financial resources. The traditional manual processing method can not adapt to the requirements of accurate evaluation, fast evaluation and good evaluation.

This paper critically examines the multifaceted adoption of GenAI in HE by reviewing interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks from psychology, computer science, and pedagogy. It highlights the insufficiency of traditional technology acceptance models, which predominantly address cognitive and rational decision-making processes, and advocates for the inclusion of emotional and ethical dimensions often overlooked in existing frameworks. By synthesizing research across various disciplines, this review identifies significant gaps and proposes an integrated theoretical model to effectively understand and guide GenAI adoption. The proposed framework emphasizes the need for robust, empirically supported methodologies that accommodate the complex, dynamic nature of GenAI applications. This paper not only contributes to academic discourse by providing a comprehensive review of existing literature but also sets a foundation for future empirical studies aimed at refining GenAI integration strategies in HE, ensuring they are ethically aligned and educationally effective.},

 abstract = {In creator economy, the online platform posts contract to incentivize creators for high-quality content. The creators can use human effort or Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to assist them to create content for rewards. In this work, we identify that the existing contract suffers from GenAI-Induced Effort Degradation, where creators may not try their best to create high-quality content, but instead turn to GenAI to save effort and extract additional reward. Our results show that GenAI-induced effort degradation arises from failing to provide the same profit for the creators generating the same quality content. With this observation, we design the contract for creator economy in the era of GenAI as a classical contract for human content and a reward for the GenAI content which depends on the estimation of the human effort cost required to achieve GenAI's content quality. To overcome the curse of dimensionality in learning the optimal contract that maximizes platform profit with a high-quality content guarantee, we design an adaptive action pruning method that gradually filters out contracts resulting in low quality. Simulation experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

My research is focused on the use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Special Education to help create more equitable learning environments for learners with disabilities. I hope to propose my dissertation studies plan by the end of August 2025. I will continue my research and plan to defend my dissertation in 2026. After I defend my dissertation, I would like to transition to a career in academia or work in a research lab. My dissertation is at the intersection of AI, Human-Computer Interaction, and inclusive education through the lens of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) [1]. Specifically, I am investigating how generative AI tools [2], such as large language models, can support special educators in designing accessible and personalized learning experiences for students with disabilities [4]. Previously, I contributed to research on DIY assistive technologies [3]. The first phase of my research included a qualitative interview study examining how K-12 special educators use and perceive AI. Findings highlighted opportunities and challenges of the use of AI. Concerns included lack of professional development, bias in AI, accessibility, and privacy issues. In the second phase, I conducted a focus group with special educators to understand how they have been using generative AI. I also conducted a participatory design session with one participant to discuss the design of an AI-enhanced tool they would like. These sessions provided an understanding of special educator experiences using AI to support neurodiverse learners. In the next phase of my research, I plan to conduct a qualitative study to understand how generative AI can assist parents and students in developing self-advocacy skills and in the creation of goals for their Individualized Education Plan (IEP) [5]. The study aims to understand experiences, perceptions, and needs of parents and students when using generative AI tools for self-advocacy.},

However, it remains underexplored how GenAI chatbots influence visitors’ in-field experience and interaction at art museums regarding finding information, engagement, and enjoyment compared to existing museum tour-guide applications. In this paper, we contribute the design and implementation of a smartphone-based chatbot that detects artwork, generates textual and auditory information, and interactively answers visitors’ questions. To explore visitors’ experience with it, we conducted a field experiment (N=30) at the National Art Museum, comparing it to the existing museum application. Our results indicate that visitors showed higher artwork engagement with the chatbot than the museum application. Moreover, they enjoyed an interactive experience using the chatbot to learn about the art collection and have equally preferred textual and auditory information representation.},

 abstract = {Reading skills are crucial for students' success in education and beyond. However, reading proficiency among K-12 students has been declining globally, including in Sweden, leaving many underprepared for post-secondary education. Additionally, an increasing number of students have reading disorders, such as dyslexia, which require support. Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) technologies, like ChatGPT, may offer new opportunities to improve reading practices by enhancing the readability of educational texts. This study investigates whether ChatGPT-4 can simplify academic texts and which prompting strategies are most effective. We tasked ChatGPT to re-write 136 academic texts using four prompting approaches: Standard, Meta, Roleplay, and Chain-of-Thought. All four approaches improved text readability, with Meta performing the best overall and the Standard prompt sometimes creating texts that were less readable than the original. This study found variability in the simplified texts, suggesting that different strategies should be used based on the specific needs of individual learners. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of genAI tools, like ChatGPT, to improve the accessibility of academic texts, offering valuable support for students with reading difficulties and promoting more equitable learning opportunities.},

 abstract = {Formative assessment can enhance student learning and improve teaching practices by identifying areas for growth and providing feedback. However, practical obstacles remain, such as time constraints and students’ passive participation and the low quality of peer feedback. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been explored for its potential to automate grading and provide timely feedback, making it a valuable tool in formative assessment. Nevertheless, there is still limited research on how AI can be used effectively in the context of formative peer assessment. In this study, we conducted an AI-driven formative peer assessment with 108 secondary school students. During the peer assessment process, students not only evaluated peers’ responses and received peer-generated feedback, but also evaluated AI-generated responses and received AI-generated feedback. This research focused on analyzing the differences in preference between AI-generated and peer-generated feedback using trace data and dispositional data. In scenarios where student participation was low or the quality of peer feedback was insufficient, students showed a higher preference for AI-generated feedback, demonstrating its potential utility. However, students with high Math Confidence and AI Interest preferred peer-generated feedback. Based on these findings, we will propose practical strategies for implementing AI-driven formative peer assessment.},

 abstract = {Generative AI is transforming the educational landscape, raising significant concerns about cheating. Despite the widespread use of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in assessments, the detection of AI cheating in MCQ-based tests has been almost unexplored, in contrast to the focus on detecting AI-cheating on text-rich student outputs. In this paper, we propose a method based on the application of Item Response Theory (IRT) to address this gap. Our approach operates on the assumption that artificial and human intelligence exhibit different response patterns, with AI cheating manifesting as deviations from the expected patterns of human responses. These deviations are modeled using Person-Fit Statistics (PFS). We demonstrate that this method effectively highlights the differences between human responses and those generated by premium versions of leading chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini), but that it is also sensitive to the amount of AI cheating in the data. Furthermore, we show that the chatbots differ in their reasoning profiles. Our work provides both a theoretical foundation and empirical evidence for the application of IRT to identify AI cheating in MCQ-based assessments.},

This study explored how 165 educators designed and integrated 12,749 TLA in 218 LDs using clustering, pattern-mining, and correlational analysis. The findings suggest most educators use a combination of four common LD TLAs (i.e., Collaboration, Generating independent learning, Assessment, and Traditional classroom activities).

 abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) simplify complex learner data into accessible visualisations, providing actionable insights for educators and students. However, their educational effectiveness has not always matched the sophistication of the technology behind them. Explanatory and interactive LADs, enhanced by generative AI (GenAI) chatbots, hold promise by enabling dynamic, dialogue-based interactions with data visualisations and offering personalised feedback through text. Yet, the effectiveness of these tools may be limited by learners’ varying levels of GenAI literacy, a factor that remains underexplored in current research. This study investigates the role of GenAI literacy in learner interactions with conventional (reactive) versus scaffolding (proactive) chatbot-assisted LADs. Through a comparative analysis of 81 participants, we examine how GenAI literacy is associated with learners’ ability to interpret complex visualisations and their cognitive processes during interactions with chatbot-assisted LADs. Results show that while both chatbots significantly improved learner comprehension, those with higher GenAI literacy benefited the most, particularly with conventional chatbots, demonstrating diverse prompting strategies. Findings highlight the importance of considering learners’ GenAI literacy when integrating GenAI chatbots in LADs and educational technologies. Incorporating scaffolding techniques within GenAI chatbots can be an effective strategy, offering a more guided experience that reduces reliance on learners’ GenAI literacy.},

Value-sensitive design (VSD) is a human-centered and theory-grounded approach to technology design that explicitly elicits and accounts for human values. However, there is scant concrete guidance on how to involve students in co-designing LA technologies from a VSD perspective, in an efficient manner. This paper presents a novel method, called VALA/AID, to elicit student values, challenges and motivations, in the early stages of an LA design process.

 abstract = {In computer-based learning environments (CBLEs), adopting effective self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies requires sophisticated coordination of multiple SRL processes. While various studies have proposed adaptive SRL scaffolds (i.e. real-time advice on adopting effective SRL processes) and embedded them in CBLEs to facilitate learners’ effective use of SRL strategies, two key research gaps remain. First, there is a lack of research on SRL scaffolds that are based on continuous assessment of both learners’ SRL processes and learning conditions (e.g., awareness of learning resources) to provide adaptive support. Second, current analytics-based scaffolding mechanisms lack the scalability needed to effectively address multiple learning conditions. Integration of analytics of SRL with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can provide scalable scaffolding for real-time SRL processes and evolving conditions. Yet, empirical studies implementing and evaluating effects of this integration remain scarce. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized control trial, assigning participants to three groups (control, process only, and process with condition groups) to investigate the effects of using GenAI to turn insights from real-time analytics about students’ SRL processes and conditions into adaptive scaffolds. The results demonstrate that integrating real-time analytics with GenAI in adaptive SRL scaffolds – addressing both SRL processes and dynamic conditions – promotes more metacognitive learning patterns compared to the control and process-only groups. In addition, the learners showed varying levels of compliance with analytics-based GenAI scaffolds, and this was also reflected in how the learners coordinated their SRL processes, particularly in the performance phase of SRL. This study contributes to the literature by designing, implementing, and evaluating the impact of adaptive scaffolds on learners’ SRL processes using real-time analytics with GenAI.},

 abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) represent a significant share of global resource usage. Notably, the energy consumption of data centres has emerged as a critical concern, escalating rapidly, especially with the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. This surge in energy demand calls for efforts focused on measuring and reducing the energy and carbon footprints of components used in ICT service delivery. However, the variety and multitude of devices involved in these services make it challenging to accurately measure and evaluate these footprints.In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to assess energy impacts by considering data centres for what they are: throughput computing systems offering ICT services. We define a simple experimental testbed and evaluate several machines with different hardware capacities. These machines serve two ICT services: a loop incrementing a counter until a defined limit, and an AI inference predicting the next token based on an input.Our experiment highlights three main take-aways: (a) the CPU usage is a poor predictor of the power consumption, (b) the energy or CO2 quantity associated with a service visit highly depends on the total load the service is facing, and (c) modern machines do not yield better energy figures compared to older ones in all circumstances.},

Despite growing interests in investigating this phenomenon, there is little conceptual clarity or consistency regarding what actually constitutes a "gender stereotype" in AI. Therefore, it is critical to provide a more comprehensive image of existing understandings and ongoing discussions of gender stereotypes of AI to guide AI design that reduces the harmful effects of these stereotypes. In doing so, this paper presents a scoping review of over 20 years of research across HCI, HRI and various social science disciplines on how gender stereotypes are applied to AI. We outline the methods and contexts of this growing body of work, develop a typology to clarify these stereotypes, highlight under-explored approaches for future research, and offer guidelines to improve rigor and consistency in this field that may inform responsible AI design in the future.},

Aiming to overcome these challenges, this study proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) -aided method that uses AI-generated content (AIGC) technology to accelerate the visualization process of this time-consuming and intricate craft by investigating the role of AI in craft design. First, a comprehensive study of filigree art culture is conducted to identify more than ten historic filigree techniques to obtain AI opportunities. Then, an AI-powered framework called AIFiligree is developed by optimizing culture-based labels and training parameters, enabling the generation of highly authentic fine filigree structures. Further, user workflows are introduced to support diverse design scenarios.

However, our preliminary study with six AR practitioners revealed that the current AIGC lacks contextual information to adapt to varying application scenarios and is therefore limited in authoring. To utilize the strong generative power of GenAI to ease the authoring of AR instruction while capturing the context, we developed CARING-AI, an AR system to author context-aware humanoid-avatar-based instructions with GenAI. By navigating in the environment, users naturally provide contextual information to generate humanoid-avatar animation as AR instructions that blend in the context spatially and temporally. We showcased three application scenarios of CARING-AI: Asynchronous Instructions, Remote Instructions, and Ad Hoc Instructions based on a design space of AIGC in AR Instructions. With two user studies (N=12), we assessed the system usability of CARING-AI and demonstrated the easiness and effectiveness of authoring with Gen-AI.},

Sketch2Terrain empowers non-experts to create unambiguous sketch maps of natural environments and provides a homogeneous interface for researchers to collect data and conduct experiments. A between-subject study (N=36) revealed that generative-3D-sketch-mapping improved efficiency by 38.4\%, terrain-topology accuracy by 12.5\%, and landmark accuracy by up to 12.1\%, with only a 4.7\% trade-off in terrain-elevation accuracy compared to freehand 3D-sketch-mapping. Additionally, generative-3D-sketch-mapping reduced perceived strain by 60.5\% and stress by 39.5\% over 2D-sketch-mapping. These findings underscore potential applications of generative-3D-sketch-mapping for in-depth understanding and accurate representation of vertically complex environments.

 abstract = {Conceptual design is an important stage in industrial product development, influenced by the design space and materials available to designers. Advancements in human-computer interaction&nbsp;(HCI) and artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI) technologies have broadened these aspects considerably. On the one hand, augmented reality&nbsp;(AR) technologies merge physical and virtual representations to enhance intuitive interaction and embodied cognition. On the other hand, generative artificial intelligence&nbsp;(GAI) serves as a novel design material, boosting creativity and productivity. Inspired by these technological strides, we proposed an Intelli-Embodied Design Space&nbsp;(IEDS), which integrates designers, AR, and GAI to support industrial conceptual design by combining embodied interaction with generative variability. Within IEDS, designers can interact with the physical prototypes intuitively, while GAI refines these into virtual forms that can be embedded in the physical world through AR technology. In this study, we established the theoretical framework and interaction modes of IEDS through literature reviews and expert interviews. Subsequently, we designed and implemented three GAI+AR tools, GAI + Head-mounted Display&nbsp;(HMD), GAI + Handheld Display&nbsp;(HHD), and GAI + Spatial Augmented Reality&nbsp;(SAR), based on three AR approaches in IEDS to practically examine the benefits and challenges of these interaction modes across industrial conceptual design tasks. We discussed IEDS’s influence on industrial conceptual design and released its application guidelines to the HCI community.},

This paper presents the findings of a qualitative study that employed a provocative prototype ‘camera’ – the A(I)Cam – to engage creative practitioners directly in these discussions. Developed using a Research-through-Design (RtD) approach, the tangible prototype generates and instantly prints AI-created images. A(I)Cam facilitated reflection among creative practitioners (N=15) on their experiences with AI-driven tools and the broader implications for their future practices. We examine the shifts in perspective that emerged from engaging with this embodied form of generative AI (genAI), challenging traditional text-based interaction paradigms, and inviting new modes of creative exploration and reflection. In addition, we offer insights from the RtD project, highlighting the integration of genAI tools into the industrial design process.},

This study evaluates three different interaction modes (prompt-based, preset-based, and motif-based) of commercialized music AI toots with 17 participants of varying musical expertise to examine how prompt-based GenAI can improve creative intention. Our findings revealed that user groups preferred prompt-based music GenAI for distinct purposes: experts used it to validate musical concepts, novices to generate reference samples, and nonprofessionals to transform abstract ideas into musical compositions. We identified its potential for enhancing compositional efficiency and creativity through intuitive interaction, while also noting limitations in handling temporal and musical nuances solely through prompts.

However, our formative study highlights the challenges for non-expert users in crafting appropriate prompts and specifying fine-grained spatial conditions (e.g., depth or canny references) to generate semantically cohesive images, especially when multiple objects are involved. In response, we introduce SketchFlex, an interactive system designed to improve the flexibility of spatially conditioned image generation using rough region sketches. The system automatically infers user prompts with rational descriptions within a semantic space enriched by crowd-sourced object attributes and relationships. Additionally, SketchFlex refines users’ rough sketches into canny-based shape anchors, ensuring the generation quality and alignment of user intentions. Experimental results demonstrate that SketchFlex achieves more cohesive image generations than end-to-end models, meanwhile significantly reducing cognitive load and better matching user intentions compared to region-based generation baseline.},

Despite concerns over potential risks of GenAI and unclear university policies, students described GenAI tools as a useful resource for personalizing learning, promoting self-care, and assisting with important self-advocacy work. Guidance demonstrating safe, acceptable uses of GenAI tools, along with clear policies and resources that acknowledge diverse student needs, were desired.

 abstract = {Museum field trips provide a rich learning experience for children. However, they are complex and expensive for teachers to organize. Fortunately, digitization of museum artifacts makes it possible to use museum resources within the classroom. Museum in the Classroom (MITC) explores how augmented reality (AR) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) can create an interactive learning experience around museum artifacts. This iPad app allows educators to select historical topics from a curated artifact library, generating AR-based exhibits that students can explore. MITC engages students through interactive AR artifacts, AI-driven chatbots, and AI-generated quiz questions, based on a real exhibition at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University. A formative study with middle schoolers (N = 20) demonstrated that the app increased engagement compared to traditional learning methods. MITC also fostered a playful and comfortable environment to interact with museum artifacts. Our findings suggest that combining AR and AI has the potential to enrich classroom learning and offer a scalable alternative to traditional museum visits.},

This is critical in the era of generative artificial intelligence and pervasive digital technologies, where technology design substantially shapes what and how humans are learning. This paper introduces “support for learning” as an explicit design goal for everyday technologies. To provide background, we first differentiate four relationships between learning and technology: (1) learning to use technology, (2) learning about technology, (3) learning as a primary design goal, and (4) learning through technology. Designers can intentionally facilitate the latter (a) by following established design principles for usability and user experience, but need to go beyond such known ground by (b) identifying potential learning goals, and (c) connecting to high-quality learning resources and technology designed from within the system. A future research agenda should investigate the relationships between patterns of technology design, patterns of technology use, and learning.},

As GenAI integration in higher education grows, understanding its influence on critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity is essential. Using a mixed-effects model, we synthesized data from quantitative studies to explore two moderators: cognitive skill level (e.g., understanding, applying, analyzing) and instructional context (instructed vs. unguided use). Our findings indicate that GenAI tools significantly enhance lower-order cognitive outcomes, particularly in understanding and applying concepts, with instructed use producing stronger positive effects than unguided use. However, their impact on higher-order cognitive skills, such as creating and evaluating, was minimal. These results highlight the importance of tailoring GenAI integration to task complexity and underscore the value of guided instruction in maximizing its educational benefits. Educators should prioritize instructional strategies that encourage active engagement with GenAI tools, particularly for fostering critical thinking and creativity.},

Moreover, limited research had examined how TAM dimensions vary across different tasks. This late-breaking study revealed that teachers consistently rated GAI lower for accommodations across all TAM dimensions, with particularly differences in Intention to Use and Actual Use. The results highlighted the complexities of adopting GAI for distinct instructional purposes.

This work explores how LLMs can augment medical curricula through interactive learning. We conducted a participatory design process with medical students, residents and medical education experts to co-create an AI-powered tutor prototype for clinical reasoning. As part of the co-design process, we conducted a qualitative user study, investigating learning needs and practices via interviews, and conducting concept evaluations through interactions with the prototype. Findings highlight the challenges learners face in transitioning from theoretical knowledge to practical application, and how an AI tutor can provide personalized practice and feedback. We conclude with design considerations, emphasizing the importance of context-specific knowledge and emulating positive preceptor traits, to guide the development of AI tools for medical education.},

Since a USAR canine often works out of sight of the handler, the handler lacks awareness of the canine’s location and situation, known as the “sensemaking gap.” In this paper, we propose KHAIT, a novel approach to close the sensemaking gap and enhance USAR effectiveness by integrating object detection-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR). Equipped with AI-powered cameras, edge computing, and AR headsets, KHAIT enables precise and rapid object detection from a canine’s perspective, improving survivor localization. We evaluate this approach in a real-world USAR environment, demonstrating an average survival allocation time decrease of 22\%, enhancing the speed and accuracy of operations.},

Yet, users’ understanding of how such ecosystems work remains unknown. In this paper, we investigate users’ mental models of how GenAI Chatbot Ecosystems work. This is an important question because users’ mental models guide their behaviors, including making decisions that impact their privacy. Through 21 semi-structured interviews, we uncovered users’ four mental models towards first-party (e.g., Google Gemini) and third-party (e.g., ChatGPT) GenAI Chatbot Ecosystems. These mental models centered around the role of the chatbot in the entire ecosystem. We further found that participants held a more consistent and simpler mental model towards third-party ecosystems than the first-party ones, resulting in higher trust and fewer concerns towards the third-party ecosystems. We discuss the design and policy implications based on our results.},

 abstract = {Human-Computer Interaction practitioners have been proposing best practices in user interface design for decades. However, generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) brings additional design considerations and currently lacks sufficient user guidance regarding affordances, inputs, and outputs. In this context, we developed a recommender system to promote responsible AI (RAI) practices while people prompt GenAI systems, by recommending addition of sentences based on social values and removal of harmful sentences. We detail a lightweight recommender system designed to be used in prompting-time and compare its recommendations to the ones provided by three base large language models (LLMs) and two LLMs fine-tuned for the task, i.e., recommending inclusion of sentences based on social values and removal of harmful sentences from a given prompt. Results indicate that our approach has the best F1-score balance in terms of recommendations for additions and removal of sentences to promote responsible prompts, while a fine-tuned model obtained the best F1-score for additions, and our approach obtained the best F1-score for removals of harmful sentences. In addition, fine-tuned models improved the objectiveness of responses by reducing the verbosity of generated content in 93\% when compared to the content generated by base models. Presented findings contribute to RAI by showing the limits and bias of existing LLMs in terms of recommendations on how to create more responsible prompts and how open-source technologies can fill this gap in prompting-time.},

 abstract = {The progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fueled AI-powered tools like co-pilots and assistants to provision better guidance, particularly during data analysis. However, research on guidance has not yet examined the perceived efficacy of the source from which guidance is offered and the impact of this source on the user’s perception and usage of guidance. We ask whether users perceive all guidance sources as equal, with particular interest in three sources: (i) “AI,” (ii) “human expert,” and (iii) “a group of human analysts.” As a benchmark, we consider a fourth source, (iv) “unattributed guidance,” where guidance is provided without attribution to any source, enabling isolation of and comparison with the effects of source-specific guidance. We design a five-condition between-subjects study, with one condition for each of the four guidance sources and an additional (v) “no-guidance” condition, which serves as a baseline to evaluate the influence of any kind of guidance. We situate our study in a custom data preparation and analysis tool wherein we task users to select relevant attributes from an unfamiliar dataset to inform a business report. Depending on the assigned condition, users can request guidance, which the system then provides in the form of attribute suggestions. To ensure internal validity, we control for the quality of guidance across source-conditions. Through several metrics of usage and perception, we statistically test five preregistered hypotheses and report on additional analysis. We find that the source of guidance matters to users, but not in a manner that matches received wisdom. For instance, users utilize guidance differently at various stages of analysis, including expressing varying levels of regret, despite receiving guidance of similar quality. Notably, users in the AI condition reported both higher post-task benefit and regret. These findings strongly indicate the need to further understand how different guidance sources impact user behavior for designing effective guidance systems.},

We collected real student responses and human grading data from various subjects in the 2024 National College Entrance Examination in one of the provinces in China, and trained a scoring model. By comparing machine-generated scores with human scores and implementing a designed screening strategy, we ultimately identified samples that require re-evaluation by expert graders for final scoring. This method only requires a small amount of human scoring to train the model. Experiments on real data demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively identifies responses that need re-evaluation, thereby improving the overall grading quality.},

This article designs and proposes an author influence recognition algorithm based on open review, which analyzes the text of open review content on social media and forms multiple different label clusters to represent the author's different characteristics, thereby achieving multi angle recognition of author influence. Finally, this article conducted empirical research and application using the F1000 open review platform, and the results showed that the proposed algorithm can assign multiple label scores to each author, achieving multi angle recognition of author influence, making author influence more comprehensive and three-dimensional. Through relevant analysis with traditional identification methods, the author believes that the open review recognition algorithm can play a certain complementary role in identifying author influence. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the open review algorithm into the existing author influence evaluation and recognition system, so as to more comprehensively and vividly reflect the author's influence and personal characteristics, better provide and recommend truly high-quality and excellent authors and articles to the academic community, and promote the healthy dissemination of science.},

Through comparative analysis, this paper highlights the advantages and limitations of current detection methods and outlines potential research directions for the future. Our aim is to provide valuable insights to researchers in related fields, thereby promoting the further development of AIGC detection technology and enhancing our ability to address the challenges posed by AIGC.},

 abstract = {Fingerprint biometrics are extensively used for identification and security, from border control to consumer electronics. The permanence of fingerprints means security breaches can have lasting impacts. Traditionally, organizations store only fingerprint templates to mitigate the risks associated with stolen fingerprint images. However, advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly deepfake technologies, now enable adversaries to generate fingerprints from stolen templates, increasing the threat of data breaches.In this paper, we demonstrate and validate a previously theorized threat by evaluating an end-to-end attack in the physical world. Our approach involves: (1) generating fingerprint images from unseen templates, (2) fabricating silicone replicas of these deepfake fingerprints using a 3D resin printer, and (3) successfully deceiving fingerprint scanners with the replicas. The entire lab setup cost only $440 USD and only 7 cents to replicate each fingerprint thereafter, highlighting the attack's practicality.To support reproducibility and encourage the development of defenses, we publicly release our deepfake fingerprint pipeline.},

We analyze seven representative studies, comparing their model architectures, alignment with deepfake transformation types, evaluation metrics, and application scenarios. Our review identifies a range of promising technical strategies with particular attention to how recent approaches address demographic fairness, face and body anonymization, and real-world deployment challenges.

 abstract = {The continuous development of artificial intelligence (AI) theory has propelled this field to unprecedented heights, owing to the relentless efforts of scholars and researchers. In the medical realm, AI takes a pivotal role, leveraging robust machine learning (ML) algorithms. AI technology in medical imaging aids physicians in X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnoses, conducts pattern recognition and disease prediction based on acoustic data, delivers prognoses on disease types and developmental trends for patients, and employs intelligent health management wearable devices with human-computer interaction technology to name but a few. While these well-established applications have significantly assisted in medical field diagnoses, clinical decision-making, and management, collaboration between the medical and AI sectors faces an urgent challenge: How to substantiate the reliability of decision-making? The underlying issue stems from the conflict between the demand for accountability and result transparency in medical scenarios and the black-box model traits of AI. This article reviews recent research grounded in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), with an emphasis on medical practices within the visual, audio, and multimodal perspectives. We endeavor to categorize and synthesize these practices, aiming to provide support and guidance for future researchers and healthcare professionals.},

 abstract = {Numerous fairness metrics have been proposed and employed by artificial intelligence (AI) experts to quantitatively measure bias and define fairness in AI models. Recognizing the need to accommodate stakeholders' diverse fairness understandings, efforts are underway to solicit their input. However, conveying AI fairness metrics to stakeholders without AI expertise, capturing their personal preferences, and seeking a collective consensus remain challenging and underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a new framework, EARN (Explain, Ask, Review, and Negotiate) Fairness, which facilitates collective metric decisions among stakeholders without requiring AI expertise. The framework features an adaptable interactive system and a stakeholder-centered EARN Fairness process to Explain fairness metrics, Ask stakeholders' personal metric preferences, Review metrics collectively, and Negotiate a consensus on metric selection. To gather empirical results, we applied the framework to a credit rating scenario and conducted a user study involving 18 decision subjects without AI knowledge. We elicited their personal metric preferences and subsequently we studied how they reached metric consensus in team sessions. Our work shows that the EARN Fairness framework supports stakeholders to express and negotiate fairness preferences, and we provide practical guidance for implementing human-centered AI fairness in high-risk contexts. Through this approach, we aim to reach consensus of fairness perspectives, fostering more equitable and inclusive AI fairness.},

Designers usually approach these problems through participatory methods but struggle to incorporate diverse perspectives into design outputs. The growing capabilities of image-generative artificial intelligence (IGAI) could support participatory design. Prior work in leveraging IGAI's capabilities in design has focused on augmenting the experience and performance of individual creators. We study how IGAI could facilitate participatory processes when designing public spaces, a complex collaborative task. We conducted workshops and IGAI-mediated interviews in a real-world participatory process to upgrade a park in Los Angeles. We found (1) a shift from focusing on accuracy to fostering richer conversations as the desirable outcome of adopting IGAI in participatory design, (2) that IGAI promoted more space-aware conversations, and (3) that IGAI-mediated conversations are subject to the abilities of the facilitators in managing the interaction between themselves, the AI, and stakeholders. We contribute by discussing practical implications for using IGAI in participatory design, including success metrics, relevant skills, and asymmetries between designers and stakeholders. We finish by proposing a series of open research questions.},

The attention of researchers and practitioners has gradually shifted from advancing model design to enhancing the quality and quantity of the data. In this survey, we discuss the necessity of data-centric AI, followed by a holistic view of three general data-centric goals (training data development, inference data development, and data maintenance) and the representative methods. We also organize the existing literature from automation and collaboration perspectives, discuss the challenges, and tabulate the benchmarks for various tasks. We believe this is the first comprehensive survey that provides a global view of a spectrum of tasks across various stages of the data lifecycle. We hope it can help the readers efficiently grasp a broad picture of this field, and equip them with the techniques and further research ideas to systematically engineer data for building AI systems.

Therefore, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study adopts the method of structural equation model to deeply understand the influencing factors of college students' dishonest behaviors in online learning under the background of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm all have a significant positive impact on behavior intention of dishonesty when online learning. Specifically, the attitude of dishonest behaviors in online learning is influenced by autonomous motivation (e.g., intrinsic interest, self-improvement) and controlled motivation (e.g., external rewards, avoidance of punishments); perceived behavioral control is influenced by autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and moral obligation; and the subjective norm is not only affected by autonomous motivation but also by moral obligation.

A thorough analysis of these policies on a global scale is important for guiding educational innovation and ensuring the effectiveness of technology applications. This article uses a content analysis method, taking 26 artificial intelligence education policies from major countries and international organizations as samples, and employs a "policy tool—policy content" two-dimensional analysis framework to quantitatively analyze the policy texts to reveal the characteristics of international artificial intelligence education policies. The study finds that the current types of policy tools are mainly supply-oriented and environmental-oriented, focusing more on dimensions such as quality assessment and assurance, resource environment construction, and future talent cultivation in terms of content elements. Supply-side tools provide resource support for the construction of intelligent educational environments and innovative cultivation services for the improvement of teachers' and students' intelligent literacy; environmental tools build institutional standards for the quality assurance of intelligent education and create organizational strategies to achieve inclusive and fair education. Finally, the study proposes suggestions for the formulation and optimization of artificial intelligence education policies from four aspects: strengthening talent cultivation, focusing on independent research and development, deepening international exchanges, and systematic policy design, to promote the high-quality development of teaching and education in the digital age.},

This concept is further enhanced by generative AI technology, which promises more efficient and accurate AI-driven data generation for network simulation and optimization. This survey provides insights into generative AI-empowered network digital twins. We begin by outlining the architecture of a network digital twin, which encompasses both digital and physical domains. This architecture involves four key steps: data processing and network monitoring, digital replication and network simulation, designing and training network optimizers, Sim2Real, and network control. Next, we systematically discuss the related studies in each step and make a detailed taxonomy of the problem studied, the methods used, and the key designs leveraged. Each step is examined with a focus on the role of generative AI, from estimating missing data and simulating network behaviors to designing control strategies and bridging the gap between digital and physical domains. Finally, we discuss the open issues and challenges of generative AI-based network digital twins.},

For example, an increasing number of high-profile news reports that widely-used algorithms have unfairly discriminated against some groups of people (e.g., by gender and race) in parole decisions and other major life events. Focusing more attention on ethical bias in learning algorithms is key to unlocking the potential of automated decision systems while ensuring fairness and accountability so that everyone can advance equally in society. Ethical AI has become increasingly important and it has been attracting attention from academia and industry, due to its increased popularity in real-world applications with fairness concerns. It also places fundamental importance on ethical considerations in determining legitimate and illegitimate uses of AI. Organizations that apply ethical AI have clearly stated well-defined review processes to ensure adherence to legal guidelines. Therefore, the wave of research at the intersection of ethical AI in data mining and machine learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and social science.},

In parallel, the recent emergence of large foundational models has driven machine learning into a new era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), and this revolution presents both unprecedented opportunities and profound challenges for the well-established GML paradigms. However, few investigations have analyzed and envisioned how GML should evolve to harness these opportunities, address these challenges, and embrace this new Gen-AI era.

The proposed methodology for the technological model integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and GPT technologies, allowing the loading of documents in different formats, such as PDF and Markdown documents, which are then analyzed using the aforementioned technologies to respond to customer requests precisely, enabling a more personalized and efficient interaction. For testing the technological model, a prototype was designed, from which the level of satisfaction of a sample of 50 customers was evaluated after interacting with the application and the traditional method. As a result, it was observed that customers experienced a satisfaction level of 59.4\% when served traditionally, while with the technological model interaction, they recorded an average satisfaction of 92.6\%. Therefore, the research concludes that the proposed technological model represents an opportunity to efficiently address customer service requests, providing a more effective and satisfactory service, which also implies the optimization of resources and costs for an organization.},

Next, we identify various characteristics and capabilities that need to be met before an AIaaS model can be successfully designed and deployed. Based on this, we present a general framework of an AIaaS architecture that integrates the required aaS characteristics with the capabilities of AI. We also compare various approaches for offering AIaaS to end users. Finally, we illustrate several real-world use cases for AIaaS models, followed by a discussion of some of the challenges that must be addressed to enable AIaaS adoption.},

 abstract = {In today's world of pervasive connectivity and intelligent technologies, modern networked systems-ranging from sprawling data centers to large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems-have grown by leaps and bounds, unlocking numerous transformative services, like smart cities, immersive mixed reality, and generative artificial intelligence (AI). Traditional network optimization and resource allocation methods-built around static models-are increasingly unable to keep up with the evolving demands of these largescale environments. AI-driven solutions are emerging as game-changers, enabling networked systems to process massive streams of data in real time and adapt seamlessly to ever-changing demands. For instance, AI-powered softwaredefined networking (SDN) controllers can instantly reroute traffic in data centers to prevent congestion, while reinforcement learning (RL)-based task offloading can intelligently allocate resources in massive IoT systems. These advancements make AI central to the next generation of intelligent, adaptive network ecosystems.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary computation (EC) is a kind of artificial intelligence (AI) for optimization. However, traditional EC algorithms require the careful design of parameters and/or operators from experts. Designing an operator with generalization ability is a tough task, and the manually design process is often limited by the structures of existing operators, which lacks diversity. In order to explore operators with diverse structures and good generalization ability so as to provide inspiration for the manually design of operators, this paper proposes a generative EC approach for the automatic design of operators by using genetic programming (GP). We apply the generative approach to a typical EC variant named gene targeting differential evolution (GTDE), so as to propose a new automatic GTDE (AGTDE) algorithm. The AGTDE utilizes the advantage of GP in optimizing structural features to automatically generate and refine the targeting vector generation operator within GTDE. This way, the operator of AGTDE is generated automatically rather than manually designed, which is more robust and optimal. The experimental results demonstrate that AGTDE is capable of identifying appropriate and even better operator for solving optimization problems, when compared with GTDE with manually design operator. Moreover, the results show that the operator obtained for one problem can be applied to other problems and obtain promising results, which reflect the robustness and generalization ability of the operator generated by GP. Therefore, this generative approach may provide some novel avenues of thought for the automatically design of EC algorithm operators.},

 abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has recently made rapid advancements, blurring the boundaries of intelligence between humans and machines. Its characteristic of generating different answers to the same question often evokes the thought process of humans. This study explores how AI-generated code, with minimal human intervention, can improve performance. There are over 100 algorithms capable of solving an NP-hard problem, the traveling salesperson problem, and it is difficult for one person to know all of them. Therefore, it is nearly impossible for a human to manually combine the advantages of various algorithms into a hybrid code. However, by leveraging AI, even someone who has no knowledge of the algorithms can generate a hybrid code that combines the strengths of different algorithms. In this experiment, AI-generated codes based on multiple algorithms are applied to genetic algorithms. The performance of hybrid codes, after undergoing crossover and mutation, was evaluated. The results showed that the performance of the AI-generated hybrid code surpassed that of the best-performing single algorithm code. This study demonstrates that AI can go beyond the mere application of existing algorithms by autonomously generating code and combining different algorithms to implement hybrid optimization techniques.},

To allow for the development and testing of new algorithms adapted to this new data landscape, test problems are necessary as a way to both evaluate and compare algorithms performances. However, while recent advances extended known test problems such as the r-Leading-Ones marking the transition from binary to multi-valued variables, having different data-types coexisting in the search space is still an open question. We propose the h-Leading-Ones as an extension of the r-Leading-Ones to evaluate the ability of an algorithm to solve problems on a search space composed of multi-valued and real-valued data types. Its design with dependency between the different data-types and its continuity with the r-Leading-Ones provides a convenient new environment for benchmark and runtime analysis for mixed-category search spaces.},

Firstly, the concepts of artificial intelligence, context-awareness and scenic mobility scooter are introduced, and the current status of theoretical research and existing problems of scenic mobility scooter are sorted out. Secondly, combining the advantages and characteristics of context-aware intervention in the scenic scooter, the context information related to the scenic scooter under the view of artificial intelligence is divided into four categories: user, environment, task, and equipment, and at the same time, different stages of the use of the context information hierarchy is categorized and corresponds to the pain point needs, and the corresponding artificial intelligence access points are analyzed. Finally, four design strategies are proposed based on the above four contextual factors. It is concluded that the application of context-awareness theory to the design of scenic mobility scooters under the perspective of artificial intelligence strengthens the ability to perceive multidimensional contextual information, explores the user's needs in dynamic situations from a multidimensional perspective, simplifies the user's operation path, and enhances the user's touring experience.},

 abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has significantly increased the sophistication and ease of image tampering techniques, posing challenges for digital forensics in identifying manipulated images. A lack of dataset standardisation hinders the ability to effectively benchmark and compare GenAI inpainting localisation techniques, reducing their reliability in digital forensic applications. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring the need for standardised criteria for datasets in digital forensics for benchmarking detection techniques through preliminary experiments.To address the limited diversity in existing datasets, a small-scale dataset was developed, consisting of 240 tampered images, 20 masks and 20 authentic images. This dataset includes four subject image classes (animals, objects, persons, scenery) and three inpainting tools (GLIDE, GalaxyAI, Photoshop). The dataset was evaluated against 13 localisation algorithms from the Image Forensics MATLAB Toolbox to determine key components that should be considered in the standardisation of testing environments.The results show that the images in the animals and persons categories achieved the highest F1-Scores and accuracy over the other classes. Among tools, GLIDE inpainted images were consistently shown to be the most challenging to detect, underscoring the importance of further investigating these images. These findings provide foundational insights for identifying a set of criteria to establish robust testing environments, enabling the development of reliable and accurate GenAI inpainting localisation techniques.},

Unlike visual errors in genAI, textual mistakes are often harder to detect and require specific domain knowledge. Furthermore, AI’s authoritative tone and structured responses can create an illusion of correctness, leading to overtrust, especially among children. To address this, we developed AI Puzzlers, an interactive system based on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), to help children identify and analyze errors in genAI. Drawing on Mayer \&amp; Moreno’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, AI Puzzlers uses visual and verbal elements to reduce cognitive overload and support error detection. Based on two participatory design sessions with 21 children (ages 6 - 11), our findings provide both design insights and an empirical understanding of how children identify errors in genAI reasoning, develop strategies for navigating these errors, and evaluate AI outputs.},

In a pilot study with 37 fifth-graders, we explored how children (ages 9–10) envision genAI and the roles they believe it should play in their daily life. Our findings reveal three key ways children envision genAI: as a companion providing guidance, a collaborator working alongside them, and a task automator that offloads responsibilities. However, alongside these hopeful views, children expressed fears about overreliance, particularly in academic settings, linking it to fears of diminished learning, disciplinary consequences, and long-term failure.

Therefore, this preliminary study explores parental perspectives on the use and impact of GenAI on adolescents aged 13 to 17. We conducted a survey with N = 159 parents from 19 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Findings suggest that most parents are unaware of how their children use GenAI and feel disconnected from them on this topic. Importantly, while parents recognise the opportunities and risks of GenAI, their views vary based on their own familiarity with the technology, with those who use it regularly being significantly more optimistic about its impact on adolescents’ development. These results highlight a gap in digital parenting when it comes to adolescents’ use of GenAI, underscoring the need for a systematic approach to parental support.

However, most work has centered on preparing young people to use these systems, with less attention to how they can participate in designing and evaluating them. This study investigates how engaging young people in the design and auditing of generative language models (GLMs) may foster the development of their understanding of how these systems work from both technical and ethical perspectives. The study takes an in-pieces approach to investigate novices’ conceptions of GLMs. Such an approach supports the analysis of how technical and ethical conceptions evolve and relate to each other. I am currently conducting a series of participatory design workshops with sixteen ninth graders (ages 14–15) in which they will (a) build GLMs from a data-driven perspective that glassboxes how data shapes model performance and (b) audit commercial GLMs by repeatedly and systematically querying them to draw inferences about their behaviors. I will analyze participants’ interactions to identify ethical and technical conceptions they may exhibit while designing and auditing GLMs. Then I will investigate the contexts in which these conceptions emerge and how participants’ personal interests and prior experiences may relate to their conceptions. I will also conduct clinical interviews and use microgenetic knowledge analysis and ordered network analysis to investigate how participants’ ethical and technical conceptions of GLMs relate to each other and change after the workshop. The study will contribute (a) evidence of how engaging youth in design and auditing activities may support the development of ethical and technical understanding of GLMs and (b) an inventory of novice design and auditing practices that may support youth’s technical and ethical understanding of GLMs.},

These prompts allow the metaverse to interact with GenAI, where context information, instructions, input data, or even output indications constituting the prompt can come from within the metaverse. However, their integration poses challenges regarding interoperability, lack of standards, scalability, and maintaining a high-quality user experience. This article explores how GenAI can productively assist in enhancing creativity within the contexts of the metaverse and unlock new opportunities. We provide a technical, in-depth overview of the different generative models for image, video, audio, and 3D content within the metaverse environments. We also explore the bottlenecks, opportunities, and innovative applications of GenAI from the perspectives of end users, developers, service providers, and AI researchers. This survey commences by highlighting the potential of GenAI for enhancing the metaverse experience through dynamic content generation to populate massive virtual worlds. Subsequently, we shed light on the ongoing research practices and trends in multimodal content generation, enhancing realism and creativity and alleviating bottlenecks related to standardization, computational cost, privacy, and safety. Last, we share insights into promising research directions toward the integration of GenAI with the metaverse for creative enhancement, improved immersion, and innovative interactive applications.},

 abstract = {Recently, we have witnessed emerging research agendas on explicating new opportunities, risks, and harm of generative AI from a CSCW perspective. Built upon these ongoing conversations and dialog, we believe that beyond merely discussing generative AI’s impacts on specific CSCW research directions, it is equally critical to promote in-depth discussions across academia and industry to reflect upon generative AI’s multidimensional impacts on the overall CSCW landscape, including: how we train and educate our next generation of CSCW and HCI researchers in the age of generative AI, how generative AI is affecting the tech industry trajectories and our students’ future job prospects in the tech industry, how we can better approach academia-industry collaboration to deal with such impacts, and how the growing focus on generative AI may (re)shape funding opportunities for future CSCW research topics. Featuring a group of panelists who are academic leaders in HCI/CSCW education and industry experts, the goal for this panel is to promote community-wide discussions and collective reflections on these key questions that are crucial for sustaining the future of CSCW.},

While advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have shown promise in augmenting creativity and productivity, these tools are primarily designed for individual use and overlook group dynamics and the collaborative aspects of teamwork. This workshop will provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to explore the design of future human-AI groups across four key themes: (1) the role of GenAI in group settings, (2) collaborative and multimodal interactions with GenAI, (3) evaluating GenAI’s influence within groups and designing for appropriate reliance, and (4) evolving group practices in the presence of GenAI. We hope to build a community and construct alignment across participants around how to pursue research that understands how GenAI can augment, undermine, or bring new practices to collaborative settings and groupwork.},

While prior work has sought to clarify some of these principles, little attention has been paid to robustness and cybersecurity. This paper aims to fill this gap. We identify legal challenges and shortcomings in provisions related to robustness and cybersecurity for high-risk AI systems (Art.&nbsp;15&nbsp;AIA) and general-purpose AI models (Art.&nbsp;55&nbsp;AIA). We show that robustness and cybersecurity demand resilience against performance disruptions. Furthermore, we assess potential challenges in implementing these provisions in light of recent advancements in the machine learning (ML) literature. Our analysis informs efforts to develop harmonized standards, guidelines by the European Commission, as well as benchmarks and measurement methodologies under Art.&nbsp;15(2)&nbsp;AIA. With this, we seek to bridge the gap between legal terminology and ML research, fostering a better alignment between research and implementation efforts.},

 abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is driving significant environmental impacts. The rapid development and deployment of larger algorithmic models consumes substantially more energy than traditional models, contributing to rising carbon emissions, water withdrawal, and e-waste generation. To mitigate these impacts, big tech companies are developing different strategies such as turning to nuclear energy to meet the demand for GenAI electricity and avoid carbon emissions, an approach that could have profound social and environmental implications beyond carbon reduction.This paper proposes a critical rethinking of GenAI’s proliferation through an ecofeminist framing, which has historically interrogated the role of science and technology in the context of gender and environmental justice. To do so, it introduces seven data ecofeminist principles delineating a pathway for developing technological and just transition alternatives within the AI research context, emphasising a critical examination of this technology’s role in the current socio-ecological crisis. The paper calls for an urgent reassessment of the GenAI innovation race, advocating for ecological and feminist technological projects that prioritise and respect life, people, and the planet.},

 abstract = {Modern AI systems are man-made objects that leverage machine learning to support our lives across a myriad of contexts and applications. Despite extensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations remain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI systems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions—their metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this perspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We do so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria—formal rules that answer the questions “When are two AI systems the same?” and “When does an AI system persist, despite change?” Building on Carrara and Vermaas’ account of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness provides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of these artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical make-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their trustworthiness profiles—the collection of capabilities that the systems must uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their effectiveness in maintaining these capabilities. Our approach suggests that the identity and persistence of AI systems is sensitive to the socio-technical context of their design and utilization via their trustworthiness, providing a solid metaphysical foundation to the epistemological, ethical, and legal discussions about these artifacts.},

 abstract = {Responsible prompt engineering has emerged as a critical pracitce for ensuring that generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are aligned with ethical, legal, and social principles. As generative AI applications become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, the way we instruct and interact with them through prompts has profound implications for fairness, accountability, and transparency. It is, therefore, necessary to examine how strategic prompt engineering can embed ethical and legal considerations and societal values directly into AI interactions, moving beyond mere technical optimization for functionality. This article proposes “Reflexive Prompt Engineering”, a comprehensive framework for responsible prompt engineering that encompasses five interconnected components: prompt design, system selection, system configuration, performance evaluation, and prompt management. Drawing from empirical evidence, the paper demonstrates how each component can be leveraged to promote improved societal outcomes while mitigating potential risks. The analysis reveals that effective prompt engineering requires a delicate balance between technical precision and ethical consciousness, combining the systematic rigor and focus on functionality with the nuanced understanding of social impact. Through examination of emerging practices, this article illustrates how responsible prompt engineering serves as a crucial connection between AI development and deployment, enabling organizations to align AI outputs without modifying underlying model architectures. This approach links with broader “Responsibility by Design” principles, embedding ethical considerations directly into the implementation process rather than treating them as post-hoc additions. The article concludes by identifying key research directions and practical guidelines for advancing the field of responsible prompt engineering as an essential component of AI literacy.},

 abstract = {The systematic testing of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models by collaborative teams and distributed individuals, often called red-teaming, is a core part of the infrastructure that ensures that AI models do not produce harmful content. Unlike past technologies, the black box nature of generative AI systems necessitates a uniquely interactional mode of testing, one in which individuals on red teams actively interact with the system, leveraging natural language to simulate malicious actors and solicit harmful outputs. This interactional labor done by red teams can result in mental health harms that are uniquely tied to the adversarial engagement strategies necessary to effectively red team. The importance of ensuring that generative AI models do not propagate societal or individual harm is widely recognized—one less visible foundation of end-to-end AI safety is also the protection of the mental health and wellbeing of those who work to keep model outputs safe. In this paper, we argue that the unmet mental health needs of AI red-teamers are a critical workplace safety concern. Through analyzing the unique mental health impacts associated with the labor done by red teams, we propose potential individual and organizational strategies that could be used to meet these needs, and safeguard the mental health of red-teamers. We develop our proposed strategies through drawing parallels between common red-teaming practices and interactional labor common to other professions (including actors, mental health professionals, conflict photographers, and content moderators), describing how individuals and organizations within these professional spaces safeguard their mental health given similar psychological demands. Drawing on these protective practices, we describe how safeguards could be adapted for the distinct mental health challenges experienced by red teaming organizations as they mitigate emerging technological risks on the new digital frontlines. Note: This work includes descriptions of violence, trauma, and mental illness.},

On one hand, GenAI tools can be used to create synthetic content legitimately. For example, advertising agencies may, with permission, generate celebrities’ images or videos using GenAI tools without putting them in front of cameras and thus reducing the overall cost of media construction. On the other hand, scammers may utilize GenAI tools to craft or edit artificial content (for example, texts, images, videos, or audio), so-called deepfakes, to mislead or deceive netizens with robocalls or voice cloning phishing, potentially causing detrimental consequences for society. This article briefly debates emerging socioeconomic threats of deepfakes in today’s society and how cyber-wellness (or digital media literacy) education can help netizens mitigate their risks.To the mitigate the risks of deepfakes, enhanced cyber-wellness programs are needed that empower both producers and consumers of generative AI–based content.},

Specifically, collaboration was observed when editing a panoramic photograph using generative artificial intelligence. These instances were rare, and were analyzed to highlight intangible affordances aiding collaborative memory recall and content creation. Afterward, five examples were correlated to influence the design of an immersive and responsive 360° theatre system using specific combinations of artificial intelligence models to aid subjective recall. In this immersive space, storyteller preferences for edited content are finally made available for new users, thereby affording new collaborative storytelling about a cultural heritage site. As a contribution, this study aids the work of designers and sociologists by showing the photo-elicitation method’s crossdisciplinary relevance to designing for collaborative, yet intangible storytelling affordances.},

Through 12 post-class group interviews, we identified how GenAI co-design behaviors present both benefits—such as enhanced creativity and faster design iterations—and risks, including shallow learning and reflection. Benefits were most evident during the execution phases, while the discovery and reflection phases showed limited gains. A taxonomy of usage patterns revealed that students’ outcomes depended more on how they used GenAI than the specific tasks performed. These findings highlight the need for HCI education to adapt to GenAI’s role and offer recommendations for curricula to better prepare future designers for effective creative co-design.},

However, consumers often struggle to articulate their preferred product features due to their unfamiliarity with terminology and their limited understanding of the structure of product features. We present DesignFromX, a system that empowers consumer-driven design space exploration by helping consumers to design a product based on their preferences. Leveraging an effective GenAI-based framework, the system allows users to easily identify design features from product images and compose those features to generate conceptual images and 3D models of a new product. A user study with 24 participants demonstrates that DesignFromX lowers the barriers and frustration for consumer-driven design space explorations by enhancing both engagement and enjoyment for the participants.},

Such stopsigns present a productive tension—they often contain partial truths worthy of consideration while simultaneously being shortsighted in ways that prevent progression. From blanket rejection to uncritical acceptance, these barriers affect how meaningfully we engage with GenAI’s potential. Our workshop welcomes both returning and first-time participants to share their experiences with these persistent challenges and work together to develop practical solutions.

This study establishes a working definition of Generative UI through a multi-method qualitative approach, integrating insights from a systematic literature review of 127 publications, expert interviews with 18 participants, and analyses of 12 case studies. Our findings identify five core themes that position Generative UI as an iterative and co-creative process. We highlight emerging design models, including hybrid creation, curation-based workflows, and AI-assisted refinement strategies. Additionally, we examine ethical challenges, evaluation criteria, and interaction models that shape the field. By proposing a conceptual foundation, this study advances both theoretical discourse and practical implementation, guiding future HCI research toward responsible and effective generative UI design practices.},

 abstract = {Eye-tracking technology is increasingly integrated into smart glasses and wearable devices, becoming more prevalent in daily life. Meanwhile, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the potential to transform user experiences through personalization and adaptive interactions. The integration of these technologies offers a novel opportunity to refine GenAI models by leveraging human gaze data in adaptive interfaces, personalized content generation, and human-computer interaction. However, gaze data is highly sensitive and can reveal several user attributes, such as cognitive states, emotions, and even medical conditions. Therefore, the use of gaze data to inform GenAI models raises significant privacy concerns. Hence, in this paper, we highlight the implications of using eye gaze information in GenAI models with privacy and societal considerations and discuss strategies to mitigate potential privacy violations. By addressing these issues, we can ensure a trade-off between technological advancements and privacy protection.},

 abstract = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has led the AI community to speculate that artificial superintelligence (ASI) may be within reach, particularly if an AI system can iteratively search for solutions, learn from results, and leverage improved knowledge for more searches. In this context, this study explores the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into Building Information Modeling (BIM) by focusing on the four key pillars of the OpenAI o1 model and their ethical implications. Through comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we examine these pillars—policy initialization, reward design, search strategies, and learning mechanisms—and their application in BIM-GenAI within a continuous improvement cycle. Results demonstrate that policy initialization generates human-like reasoning behaviors and domain-specific knowledge for BIM tasks. Reward design, central to reinforcement learning, optimizes BIM objectives through measurable metrics and learned evaluation methods. Search strategies prove valuable for exploring complex design spaces and generating high-quality BIM solutions, while learning mechanisms, including policy gradient and behavior cloning, enable continuous model improvement through feedback. The study emphasizes the importance of establishing BIM-AI protocols, maintaining human expertise in decision-making, and balancing automation with human input. Our findings suggest that while GenAI, powered by reinforcement learning, offers significant potential for enhancing BIM capabilities, three critical ethical considerations—data privacy and security, algorithmic bias mitigation, and transparency and accountability—must guide responsible implementation. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI in construction technologies and provides a foundation for the ethical advancement of BIM-GenAI systems using OpenAI o1.},

 abstract = {The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) represents a paradigm shift in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. This change revolutionizes how buildings are designed, constructed, and managed throughout their lifecycle. Using secondary data, this research aims to evaluate the current advances in the role of AI in BIM, emphasizing leveraging AI to improve organizational performance, decision-making, and project delivery. Based on the four classifications of AI systems which are Reactive AI, Limited Memory AI, Theory of Mind AI, and Self-Aware AI, this study analyzed the prospects of BIM applications. Results show that AI in BIM applications offers capabilities across domains such as generative design, predictive maintenance, energy optimization, automated code compliance, clash detection, construction simulation, sustainability analysis, project risk assessment, facility management, and natural language processing. The research also presents major issues arising from the integration of AI in a BIM setting, including Interoperability problems, Data management problems, and Technological resistance problems. Based on the evaluation of the current status and challenges associated with AI integration, this work expects to offer practical recommendations for the stakeholders interested in implementing AI technologies within their BIM projects. In addition, the research reveals new directions in integrating AI into BIM, including digital twins and generative design that will likely transform the project lifecycle. This research fills the gap in the current literature by exploring the AI limitations and opportunities in BIM environments and thereby provides insights into the application of these technologies to enhance innovation and sustainability in construction. Finally, this research provides a basis for new and more rational approaches to construction that would meet the needs of contemporary society.},

Advances in generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) further enrich these experiences by enabling adaptive learning pathways. However, evaluating such adaptive systems using traditional temporal metrics remains challenging due to the inherent variability in Gen-AI response times. To address this, our study employs multimodal behavioural metrics, including visual attention, physical exploratory behaviour, and verbal interaction, to assess user engagement in an adaptive VR environment. In a controlled experiment with (n = 54) participants, we compared three levels of adaptivity (high, moderate, and non-adaptive baseline) within a Neapolitan pizza-making VR experience. Results show that moderate adaptivity optimally enhances user engagement, significantly reducing unnecessary exploratory behaviour and increasing focused visual attention on the AI avatar. Our findings suggest that a balanced level of adaptive AI provides the most effective user support, offering practical design recommendations for future adaptive educational technologies.},

 abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offers numerous opportunities to revolutionise teaching and learning in Computing Education (CE). However, educators have expressed concerns that students may over-rely on GenAI and use these tools to generate solutions without engaging in the learning process. While substantial research has explored GenAI use in CE, and many Computer Science (CS) educators have expressed their opinions and suggestions on the subject, there remains little consensus on implementing curricula and assessment changes.In this paper, we describe our experiences with using GenAI in CS-focused educational settings and the changes we have implemented accordingly in our teaching in recent years since the popularisation of GenAI. From our experiences, we propose two primary actions for the CE community: 1) redesign take-home assignments to incorporate GenAI use and assess students on their process of using GenAI to solve a task rather than simply on the final product; 2) redefine the role of educators to emphasise metacognitive aspects of learning, such as critical thinking and self-evaluation. This paper presents and discusses these stances and outlines several practical methods to implement these strategies in CS classrooms. Then, we advocate for more research addressing the concrete impacts of GenAI on CE, especially those evaluating the validity and effectiveness of new teaching practices.},

@article{10.1145/3717834,
 abstract = {Information freshness, measured by the Age-of-Information (AoI) metric, is a crucial aspect of conventional network systems. However, the emergence of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) introduces unique requirements for assessing information freshness, rendering the traditional AoI definition inadequate. This is because the traditional AoI metric operates under the presumption that each data packet bears equal significance. In contrast, AIoT systems must prioritize the transmission of event summaries from smart IoT devices. To promptly capture events as they occur at the sources, we propose a novel information freshness metric called Age of Event (AoE). Subsequently, we thoroughly investigate the problem of AoE-minimizing transmission scheduling. This issue presents a formidable challenge because the event occurrence pattern can be unpredictable, and more crucially, the base station only becomes aware of these occurrences post-transmission. In response, we formulate algorithms and conduct a theoretical analysis applicable to scenarios characterized by complete, zero, or partial knowledge of event occurrences. Evaluations performed on a real traffic event dataset reveal that even in the absence of complete knowledge, our algorithms exhibit competitive performance when compared against the clairvoyant benchmark and markedly outperform AoI baselines.},

 abstract = {Despite recent advances in understanding the capabilities and limits of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, we are just beginning to understand their capacity to assess and reason about the veracity of content. We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and “hard” criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.},

We selected papers published since 2000 concerning the aforementioned applications, investigated the algorithms described therein, and compared their data performance in the testing sections to explore the advantages and disadvantages. Our findings reveal that SVM exhibits excellent performance in detecting attack traffic, whereas decision trees and their enhanced versions are less prominent. Additionally, genetic algorithms are not suitable for attack traffic detection but excel in filtering irrelevant traffic features. These insights hold significant implications for both real-world applications in enhancing cybersecurity measures and theoretical contributions by laying groundwork for future research in the rapidly evolving domain of DDoS attack mitigation.

On the basis of existing scholars' influence evaluation algorithms at home and abroad, this article designs a scholar influence evaluation approach and algorithm based on open peer review. That is, the qualitative content of open peer review in scholar articles is processed by certain artificial intelligence technology to form multiple label sets that can represent the influence of scholars from different dimensions, thus exploring the multi angle evaluation of scholar influence from a quality perspective. Finally, this article conducts empirical research and comparative analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using the open peer review platform F1000 as the data source platform. Empirical research has shown that the algorithm proposed in this article provides a new perspective and approach for evaluating the influence of scholars, which can preliminarily achieve multidimensional evaluation of scholars, endow scholars with personal academic profiles, and enhance the fullness and recognition of scholar influence. Comparative analysis shows that this algorithm does not have a significant correlation with bibliometric evaluation algorithms and can serve as a supplement to the existing evaluation system. The combination of traditional bibliometric analysis algorithms and open peer review based algorithms will be the future development trend of academic evaluation.},

However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research.},

 abstract = {The management of organizational and worker knowledge is a critical part of any organization. Knowledge management recognizes the explicit knowledge that workers contribute to an organization, as well as the organizational knowledge and skills acquired over time. The potential impact of generative AI (GenAI) raises many issues and opportunities related to effective knowledge management as organizations explore the impact and implications of its adoption. This research explores issues related to an increasing world of GenAI and proposes a Framework for Knowledge Management in the GenAI Era. Knowledge management workers, who are novices, might be more inclined to use generative AI for performing their tasks. Expert knowledge workers might focus on quality evaluation and quality assessment. Adoption of GenAI may help with the progression from novice to expert, while freeing up time and resources for other work. Challenges include the potential loss of critical organizational knowledge, definition of job-related requirements, expectations, and tasks, as well as over-reliance and loss of tacit or unarticulated knowledge. These challenges must be balanced against available access to large amounts of general and domain-specific knowledge from GenAI to capture the value realized from its adoption.},

 abstract = {Intelligent transportation systems are vital for modern traffic management and optimization, greatly improving traffic efficiency and safety. With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) technologies in areas like image generation and natural language processing, generative AI has also played a crucial role in addressing key issues in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), such as data sparsity, difficulty in observing abnormal scenarios, and in modeling data uncertainty. In this review, we systematically investigate the relevant literature on generative AI techniques in addressing key issues in different types of tasks in ITS tailored specifically for road transportation. First, we introduce the principles of different generative AI techniques. Then, we classify tasks in ITS into four types: traffic perception, traffic prediction, traffic simulation, and traffic decision-making. We systematically illustrate how generative AI techniques addresses key issues in these four different types of tasks. Finally, we summarize the challenges faced in applying generative AI to ITS, and discuss future research directions based on different application scenarios.},

Following Kitchenham's framework, a comprehensive search was conducted across ACM Digital Library and Web of Science databases to select 22 relevant peer-reviewed papers. Key issues identified included increased plagiarism risk due to AI-generated unique code, accuracy and reliability concerns of AI outputs, privacy and data security risks, curriculum changes to incorporate prompt engineering and critical thinking, and challenges in traditional assessment methods. Additionally, the review highlighted the potential over-reliance on AI tools, which could hinder the development of fundamental programming skills. Implementation challenges and inadequate training for educators further complicate the integration process. Addressing these challenges is crucial for leveraging the benefits of AIGC tools while maintaining academic integrity and enhancing learning outcomes in programming education.

The objective was to investigate how GenAI technologies can augment dramaturgical practices by enabling co-creation among authors, performers, and audience members.Using an iterative research-creation methodology, the project unfolded in two phases: a remote prototyping cycle and an on-site laboratory. Across three use cases: generative scenography, physical space extension, and improvised narration—AI tools were integrated into live performance contexts to dynamically respond to human presence and input. Techniques included the use of real-time generative visuals, silhouette-based transformations, and voice-activated storytelling systems.The findings highlight both the creative opportunities and technical constraints of employing GenAI in live performance. Critical insights emerged around timing, audience perception, system orchestration, and the need for adaptable, artist-centric AI workflows. This study emphasizes the potential of GenAI to function not merely as a technical instrument, but as a dramaturgical collaborator in the creation of emotionally resonant, participatory experiences.},

 abstract = {Integrating AI into blockchain consensus, such as Proof-of-Learning and Proof of Useful Work, necessitates AI enablers. However, current consensus protocols cannot ensure AI enabler quality, crucial for AI-powered distributed blockchain and federated learning. Traditional consensus middleware between network and application layers proves inadequate for AI-focused blockchain and federated learning. Thus, an AI-driven application-level consensus with quality-assured enablers is imperative.We propose Proof-of-INtelligence (PIN), an application-level consensus for AI-based blockchain and federated learning, ensuring AI enabler quality. To the best of our knowledge, PIN pioneers the first AI-centric application-level consensus for distributed environments. Employing enablers like accuracy and training quality, PIN is showcased in the federated learning setup “PIN in BlOckchAin-based fedeRateD learning (PIN-BOARD),” the first AI-specific consensus application in blockchain-based federated learning. Both PIN and PIN-BOARD are the highlights of our contributions to the presented work and emphasize the novelty. PIN is the first AI-centric application-level consensus for blockchain and pioneers decentralized AI assurance; PIN addresses the limitations of existing consensus protocols and advances blockchain-based federated learning through the novel framework called PIN-BOARD. Experimental evaluation involves PIN’s accuracy, confirmation time, and a new AI-assurance factor metric. PIN-BOARD’s assessment includes testing accuracy and reward accuracy. A thorough security analysis ensures the strength of PIN and PIN-BOARD. The comparative evaluation highlights PIN’s 20\% throughput enhancement and efficient artificial index. PIN-BOARD reduces epochs by 28.5\% for peak federated learning accuracy as compared to existing federated models. Thus, PIN emerges as an efficient AI-driven application-level consensus with AI assurance.},

In traditional education, teachers often spend a lot of time preparing lessons, because students have varying levels of proficiency, teachers need to consider whether the teaching content is suitable for everyone. Generative AI provides an effective solution to this problem by automatically generating personalized, high-quality educational content, which not only alleviates the burden on teachers but also enhances students' learning outcomes. This study focuses on a novel deep generative model—a framework based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and the self-attention mechanism (Transformer). We propose a model called the Hyperspherical Variational Self-Attention Autoencoder (HVSAE), which aims to generate personalized learning content based on students' learning situations, thereby reducing the burden on teachers and improving learning outcomes. The experimental results indicate that the model can generate high-quality educational resources, providing important support for achieving more personalized and efficient education.},

Its application in the field of education has brought about a double-sided effect. On the one hand, AI promotes the great enrichment of material and spiritual wealth and makes it possible to liberate people's hands, which are the basis and conditions for human's freedom and all-round development. On the other hand, AI also brings some hidden worries to education: reshaping people's values, exacerbating the gap in educational resources, and triggering ethical controversies. Based on the Marxist theory on the freedom and comprehensive development of human beings, this paper focuses on the hidden worries of future education under the influence of artificial intelligence to explore the reform paths of future education. The reform paths including establishing correct value concepts to correctly understand the value of education; focusing on independent and diversified learning to cultivate students’ ability of independent critical thinking; breaking down technological barriers to build a technology development platform and share AI technology; sounding ethical rules as well as strengthening institutional regulations and technological protection support to shape the concept of science and technology for good and enhance people's awareness of digital security and self-protection.

While ensuring accuracy and completeness, the quality of the responses was improved by the merge of students' queries with relevant texts using RAG technology. Regarding implementation, RAG technology consists of knowledge base construction and knowledge retrieval. It includes segmenting the document, recognizing and vectorizing it in order to build a vector database. During user retrieval, queries are sorted through the vector database interface, and the matched knowledge fragments and query statements are merged to generate answers including specific domain knowledge. This framework of the RAG question-answering system can provide accurate answers to satisfy students of all levels in personalized teaching while maintaining explainability and timeliness of the content.},

 abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is continuing to transform the communications industry, especially the field of public relations (PR). Understanding how PR students view and respond to this technological shift is becoming necessary to education and career choice. This study examined how Chinese PR students' perceptions of AI affect their career choices in PR through the lens of social cognitive career theory (SCCT). The study investigated the relationships between AI self-efficacy, outcome expectation of AI, interest in AI, AI contextual support and barrier, and PR career choice. Using an online questionnaire, the researcher collected data from 444 PR students at a Chinese university. SPSS was used to analyze the data, and reliability analysis, exploratory factor analysis, correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis were conducted to test the hypothesized relationships among the variables. The regression results indicated that AI self-efficacy, outcome expectation of AI, interest in AI, and AI contextual support positively influenced students' intention to pursue a career in PR. AI contextual barrier showed a significant negative impact on PR career choice. This study contributes to understanding how emerging technologies affect career decisions in PR education and has important implications for curriculum development and career guidance. It suggests that PR educators should focus on developing students' AI competencies while fostering their professional interests and that institutions should provide adequate support systems for AI learning. In addition, the findings provide valuable insights for PR programs that prepare students for an AI-enhanced industry.},

 abstract = {Information Retrieval (IR) systems are crucial tools for users to access information, which have long been dominated by traditional methods relying on similarity matching. With the advancement of pre-trained language models, Generative Information Retrieval (GenIR) emerges as a novel paradigm, attracting increasing attention. Based on the form of information provided to users, current research in GenIR can be categorized into two aspects: (1) Generative Retrieval (GR) leverages the generative model’s parameters for memorizing documents, enabling retrieval by directly generating relevant document identifiers without explicit indexing. (2) Reliable Response Generation employs language models to directly generate information users seek, breaking the limitations of traditional IR in terms of document granularity and relevance matching while offering flexibility, efficiency, and creativity to meet practical needs. This article aims to systematically review the latest research progress in GenIR. We will summarize the advancements in GR regarding model training and structure, document identifier, incremental learning, and so on, as well as progress in reliable response generation in aspects of internal knowledge memorization, external knowledge augmentation, and so on. We also review the evaluation, challenges, and future developments in GenIR systems. This review aims to offer a comprehensive reference for researchers, encouraging further development in the GenIR field (Github Repository: ).},

Therefore, recommendation frameworks play an important role and their usage is beneficial for a unification of education profiles in a systematic way. This  research is contributing to this development by exploring how a recommendation for the domain of Business Informatics in German speaking countries can be improved by formalizing the recommendations in a semantic model that relies on sophisticated European ontologies in the domain like the European Learning Model (ELM) and related data models. It employs Generative Artificial Intelligence Systems to create semantic models in an experimental way and evaluates the resulting model quality. The results show that a formalization using GenAI has a high potential, but currently also shows deficits in the correctness of the resulting models, requiring human oversight during the model creation.},

 abstract = {This study evaluates the consistency between an AI system and traditional doctor diagnoses in detecting heart sound abnormalities, and explores the impact of noise reduction technology on AI performance in noisy environments. Methods: Stage 1: AI and doctor diagnoses were compared in detecting single and multiple heart sound abnormalities using a deep neural network (DNN) model. Performance was measured by Cohen's Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. Stage 2: Noise reduction technology was applied to assess its effect on AI performance in high-noise environments, using frequency-domain filtering, CNNs, and metrics like the Noise Impact Index (NII) and Noise Reduction Rate (NRR). Results: In Stage 1, the AI showed high consistency with doctors for single abnormalities (Cohen's Kappa = 0.81), but underperformed for multiple abnormalities. It achieved 96\% sensitivity, 93\% specificity, and an F1 score of 0.89, though performance was affected by noise. In Stage 2, noise reduction significantly improved AI accuracy, particularly in detecting multiple abnormalities, where AI outperformed doctors. Conclusion: The AI system demonstrated strong agreement with doctors, especially in detecting single abnormalities. Noise reduction technology enhanced its diagnostic accuracy and stability, particularly in complex environments. Further optimization is needed for more comprehensive performance in diverse cases.},

 abstract = {Improving undergraduate students' ability to cope with cyber risks is one of the key issues to be addressed in the digital transformation of higher education in the era of generative artificial intelligence. In order to explore how to improve undergraduate students' ability to cope with information security threats brought about by generative artificial intelligence, this paper constructs a theoretical model for improving undergraduate students' information security behaviour in the context of generative artificial intelligence by integrating the theory of protective motivation, the theory of planned behaviour, and the theory of social cognition. Based on 354 questionnaire survey data, this study systematically analyses the influencing factors and mechanisms of undergraduate students' information security in the context of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that perceived threat, subjective norms and self-efficacy have a positive influence on students' information security behaviour intention, which in turn has a positive influence on their information security behaviour implementation, with environmental support playing a moderating role between the two. The findings of the study help to further improve the theoretical model of undergraduate students' information security behaviour in the context of artificial intelligence, and at the same time provide valuable insights for education departments and colleges and universities to take effective measures to improve undergraduate students' information security capabilities in the era of generating artificial intelligence.},

This paper systematically reviews the past five years of research on XAI applications for interpreting student performance prediction in Computer Science and STEM education. We found that behavioral and academic performance data were the most commonly used features, with the main prediction goals focused on course failure risk or grades. This study also examined the application areas of XAI, revealing that the most common uses were global feature importance analysis, individual prediction explanations, and supporting interventions and decision-making. Moreover, we found that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were the most frequently utilized XAI technique, predominantly applied at the global level, with limited use at the individual level. Furthermore, a research gap was identified in utilizing XAI to support course improvements, customize visualizations, and generate personalized recommendations. Addressing this gap could enable educators to provide personalized, data-driven guidance to better support individual students.},

A conversational AI platform, powered by ChatGPT, was developed as a pilot, and used as a virtual tutor, guiding students through an interactive, time-constrained learning session that involved two steps: teaching the new topic followed by problem-solving activities. After the session, students wrote a quiz without assistance to evaluate their newly acquired knowledge. A survey was then administered to collect student perceptions and analyze their interactions with the AI tutor. The preliminary findings suggest that GenAI tutors can effectively support learning, with most students preferring AI over human tutors due to convenience, accessibility, and stress-free environment. While variability of prompt effectiveness and students' misuse or overreliance on AI highlight areas were observed, these results highlight avenues for future research to refine GenAI strategies and improve student learning.},

However, the task quality along with the student perspective on such generated tasks remains largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper introduces and evaluates a new feature of the so-called Tutor Kai for generating comprehensive programming tasks, including problem descriptions, code skeletons, unit tests, and model solutions. The presented system allows students to freely choose programming concepts and contextual themes for their tasks. To evaluate the system, we conducted a two-phase mixed-methods study comprising (1) an expert rating of 200 automatically generated programming tasks w.r.t. task quality, and (2) a study with 26 computer science students who solved and rated the personalized programming tasks. Results show that experts classified 89.5\% of the generated tasks as functional and 92.5\% as solvable. However, the system's rate for implementing all requested programming concepts decreased from 94\% for single-concept tasks to 40\% for tasks addressing three concepts. The student evaluation further revealed high satisfaction with the personalization. Students also reported perceived benefits for learning. The results imply that the new feature has the potential to offer students individual tasks aligned with their context and need for exercise. Tool developers, educators, and, above all, students can benefit from these insights and the system itself.},

The findings reveal six perspectives on AI, highlighting children's conceptions of AI as both a human-like entity with emotional and cognitive traits and a technological tool integrated into their daily lives. Their self-generated questions demonstrate curiosity about the practical, ethical, and philosophical dimensions of AI, often drawing parallels to human learning and interactions. By addressing a research gap in early AI education, this study provides insights for designing age-appropriate AI curricula that build on children's pre-instructional conceptions, fostering foundational understanding and equitable access to AI education.},

This sometimes does not become evident until later in their education, which can mean it is harder to fix their incorrect knowledge or misunderstandings. In addition, being able to fully understand code is increasingly important in a world where students have access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as GitHub Copilot. One effective solution is to utilise code comprehension questions, where a marker asks questions about a submission to gauge understanding, this can also have the side effect of helping to detect plagiarism. However, this approach is time consuming and can be difficult and/or expensive to scale. This paper introduces AutoMCQ, which uses GenAI for the automatic generation of multiple-choice code comprehension questions. This is integrated with the CodeRunner automated assessment platform.},

This paper proposes hybrid learning through AI-based intelligent recommendation and adaptive learning techniques as a solution. Statistics from the students' learning history and behavioural data are used with deep learning for the prediction of students' learning needs accurate enough to recommend personalised resources. Students' progress in understanding is checked through natural language processing before further personalisation. The complexity of the learning content then changes dynamically in accordance to every individual. The tasks of collecting data, training the proposed model, optimising its algorithm, and validating the experiments therein are undertaken. The experiments find that the performance of student learning using the hybrid model improved by 9.3\%, reduced learning time by 15.5\%, and improved finding the right recommendation by about 23.8\% compared to the non-intelligent platform.

To this end, this paper focuses on artificial intelligence, especially the application of Deep Learning (DL) models in CT (computed tomography) image analysis and diagnosis, and explores its potential in early cancer detection. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to tumor detection in CT images. First, the image data is standardized, including resizing and normalization, to make sure that the input data is consistent, and more training samples are generated through methods for augmenting data (e.g., cropping, flipping, rotation, etc.) to enhance the model's capacity for generalization. The CNN model is primarily composed of convolutional layers, layers that pool together, fully linked layers, and functions for activation. The convolutional layers automatically extract low-level features (such as edges, textures, etc.) in the image through local receptive fields, and the pooling layers further reduce the feature dimension and enhance the model's anti-noise ability. Finally, the experimental data show that the method in this paper achieves an accuracy of 96.63 and a prediction time of 1.81 seconds, which is almost comparable to that of the professional doctor, but it is substantially shorter in prediction time.},

 abstract = {In recent years, mental health issues among college students have been on the rise, with frequent concerns such as anxiety, depression, and heightened stress. As a result, there is an increasing interest in and demand for psychological guidance and counseling. Issues related to mental wellness are particularly common during adolescence and are beginning to affect younger demographics more frequently. Among individuals aged 18-24, the risk of depression has been detected at a rate of 24.1\%. The college years represent a crucial phase in student development, characterized by academic demands, social hurdles, and shifts in self-awareness, all of which can significantly influence mental well-being. As such, it is becoming ever more crucial for colleges to prioritize the prevention of mental health challenges among their students and to offer counseling and therapeutic services. This paper delves into the significance of psychological counseling alongside the foundational concepts of artificial intelligence. By analyzing data from a sample of 566 college students, it utilizes t-tests and chi-square analyses to investigate the current implementation of AI in psychological counseling. Utilizing machine learning techniques in conjunction with predictive models powered by big data and AI algorithms, the study organizes and processes fundamental student information. Chi-square analyses are employed to explore the links between different mental health dimensions and personal characteristics, providing colleges with insights for assessing and supporting students' mental well-being.},

 abstract = {Synthetic traffic traces are useful for training traffic classifiers in privacy-constrained environments. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models are blossoming as a solution to avoid the sharing of real data and the lack of datasets. Never the less ,privacy concerns about GAI are often under-estimated. Therefore, an approach to mitigate the data leakage of a GAI is presented in this paper, with a minimum impact on the utility of synthetic traffic traces for downstream applications. For example, training a Machine Learning (ML) traffic classifier on synthetic traffic traces results in an average accuracy loss of no more than 13\% concerning training on a real dataset.},

 abstract = {The deep learning model LSTM (Long Short - Term Memory) can be used to deal with the problem of sequences, and is currently the most commonly used model to deal with music training. The process of LSTM training is sequence-to-sequence, which allows the back-and-forth relationship of notes in an instrument to be learnt by the model; however, when dealing with multiple instruments, there are multiple sequences that need to be processed at the same time, which is a limitation of the LSTM model architecture, which makes most of the current automated composition systems for single instrument training and output. However, when dealing with multiple instruments, there are multiple sequences that need to be processed at the same time, which is a limitation of the LSTM model architecture, and this makes most of the current automated composers train and output for a single instrument. Currently it is visible to deal with LSTM multiple sequences problem. Whereas this study needs to achieve multiple sound event sequence inputs corresponding to multiple sequence outputs, and the sequences are connected to each other, a problem for which there is no effective solution at present. This study attempts to choose to use Deep Improvisation (Tatsuya, 2017) for improvement by training a single track and optimizing and modifying the system to be able to have two tracks of input and two tracks of output to achieve a more resilient system, which in turn creates more realistic music. Due to the above background, the motivation to improve the deep learning automatic songwriting system arises with the expectation that the research in this paper will improve the system to be able to produce multi-tracked and more realistic music, so that more researchers will be able to apply the system to be able to produce songs and apply them to a variety of contexts at a small cost.},

 abstract = {It has recently emerged that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly developed and can create realistic speech, images, and video. Although such innovations provide many advantages, they pose major threats to the network's security. The research question of the study will, therefore, be the role and effects of generative artificial intelligence on network security, especially deepfake, artificial intelligence-driven phishing, and multimedia content manipulation. This research uses a case study analysis of real-life experiences of security threats in networked systems to show how generative AI can be misused. The findings reveal that: 1. Generative AI can create highly developed cyberattacks such as deepfake social engineering and AI-supplemented phishing, which use visually and audibly persuasive appeals to manipulate users. 2. The problem with this kind of security threat highlighted by AI is that most traditional security solutions lack awareness of such threats since they are incapable of effective real-time user authentication, over-dependence on visual and biometric verification, and lack of AI-awareness training. 3. There are significant gaps in cybersecurity policies and training. Many organizations lack formal protocols for addressing AI-related security risks, and often, organizations are applying generative AI technologies. In addressing the aforementioned vulnerabilities, the study recommends an improved security model that incorporates deepfake detection, more secure authentication, and even advanced anomaly detection systems. In furtherance, there should be improvements in policy that aim at commanding the AI media, ensuring comprehensive training of the employees on cybersecurity matters, and drives that aim at educating the public on how to enhance the strength for discouraging AI cybercrimes.},

 abstract = {Generative recommender systems have gained increasing attention as an innovative approach that directly generates item identifiers for recommendation tasks. Despite their potential, a major challenge is the effective construction of item identifiers that align well with recommender systems. Current approaches often treat item tokenization and generative recommendation training as separate processes, which can lead to suboptimal performance. To overcome this issue, we introduce ETEGRec, a novel End-To-End Generative Recommender that unifies item tokenization and generative recommendation into a cohesive framework. Built on a dual encoder-decoder architecture, ETEGRec consists of an item tokenizer and a generative recommender. To enable synergistic interaction between these components, we propose a recommendation-oriented alignment strategy, which includes two key optimization objectives: sequence-item alignment and preference-semantic alignment. These objectives tightly couple the learning processes of the item tokenizer and the generative recommender, fostering mutual enhancement. Additionally, we develop an alternating optimization technique to ensure stable and efficient end-to-end training of the entire framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to traditional sequential recommendation models and existing generative recommendation baselines.

 abstract = {The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI is fundamentally transforming information retrieval and processing on the Internet, bringing both great potential and significant concerns regarding content authenticity and reliability. This paper presents a novel quantitative approach to shed light on the complex information dynamics arising from the growing use of generative AI tools. Despite their significant impact on the digital ecosystem, these dynamics remain largely uncharted and poorly understood. We propose a stochastic model to characterize the generation, indexing, and dissemination of information in response to new topics. This scenario particularly challenges current LLMs, which often rely on real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to overcome their static knowledge limitations. Our findings suggest that the rapid pace of generative AI adoption, combined with increasing user reliance, can outpace human verification, escalating the risk of inaccurate information proliferation across digital resources. An in-depth analysis of Stack Exchange data confirms that high-quality answers inevitably require substantial time and human effort to emerge. This underscores the considerable risks associated with generating persuasive text in response to new questions and highlights the critical need for responsible development and deployment of future generative AI tools.},

 abstract = {Traditionally, the users of an information retrieval (IR) system have been human users. We present a new perspective on IR research in which the users of an IR system are intelligent agents instead of human users. Extending the current work on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we identify five novel IR tasks that an intelligent agent must be able to perform in order to achieve Human-Level Artificial Intelligence, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), including 1) External Information Retrieval (EIR) to access new information unseen by the agent, 2) Provenance Information Retrieval (PIR) to trace the provenance of information, 3) Curriculum Information Retrieval (CIR) to actively acquire the most useful new data and information for lifelong learning, 4) Rule Information Retrieval (RIR) to perform reasoning and problem solving, and 5) Scenario Information Retrieval (SIR) to leverage past scenarios for problem solving and decision making. We compare these new IR tasks with the traditional IR tasks performed by an IR system that serves human users and systematically examine the challenges involved in the five new IR tasks, providing a roadmap for new IR research within the broader context of AGI development.},

 abstract = {For decades, scholars have emphasized that tasks should be the central focus in Information Retrieval (IR). This point of view holds even more significance with the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, which can, among other capabilities, understand natural language, engage in dialog with users, generate bespoke user interfaces, and power agents to help complete tasks. GenAI presents an unprecedented opportunity to finally realize the potential of tasks in IR, enhance task-focused retrieval and interaction, and create ''magical'' task completion moments for users. In this paper, we explore the rationale and methodology behind this argument. Traditional IR systems support mostly simple tasks. The emergence of GenAI creates an opportunity for IR systems to help users achieve complex tasks and for the IR community to rekindle its interest and demonstrate leadership in this sizable and significant problem space. We underscore the pivotal role of tasks in IR and introduce new evidence supporting the notion that task-centric approaches, abstracted from specific modalities, represent the future of IR. Building on this foundation, we envision the development, utilization, and evaluation of next-generation IR systems. We propose a promising future where IR agents prioritize users, their tasks, and their situations. However, despite their potential to address task-focused and modality-independent IR, agents alone are insufficient. We propose a robust ecosystem around these agents that transcends traditional queries, questions, prompts, and modalities to address users' fundamental needs, tasks, and goals.},

 abstract = {Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence are driving a significant transformation in information retrieval and content generation, creating substantial opportunities for online advertising. Text-to-image generation technology has become increasingly prevalent in advertising content production, demonstrating promising performance improvements in terms of semantic relevance and visual appeal. However, existing models often suffer from inadequate representation of entity concepts, such as prominent product brands and recognizable landmarks. This inherent limitation subsequently leads to notable deficiencies in brand tonality, industry-specific relevance, and market adaptability of the generated advertising content. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal ad content generation framework specifically engineered for online advertising system, particularly focused on resolving the deficiency in entity concepts. Our framework is comprised of two phases: first, an image captioning module with entity-aware learning based on multimodal large language model, leveraging retrieval-augmented techniques to incorporate entity concepts into image descriptions; second, a text-to-image diffusion model refined on image-text pairs enriched with entity concepts to facilitate entity-grounded image generation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance in both image captioning and image generation compared to existing methods, particularly in the accuracy of depiction of relevant entities in advertising images. Moreover, the deployment of the framework in the system primary traffic of Baidu Search Ads, has brought significant enhancements to advertisement revenue for both advertisers and the platform.},

 abstract = {Recent progress in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has yielded significant advancements in healthcare, affecting radiology, medical imaging, drug development, patient diagnostics, and supply chain optimisation. These innovations promise more improved diagnoses and time-saving cost-effectiveness. However, GenAI’s rapid implementation poses significant challenges for meeting regulatory, ethical, and trustworthiness standards. These challenges include data privacy issues, reproducibility concerns, algorithmic bias in training data causing disparities in outcomes, and a lack of transparency and explainability. Unresolved, these issues could negatively affect the public’s confidence in and perception of GenAI systems. Addressing these challenges, international AI governance frameworks, including the EU AI Act and WHO guidelines, prioritize regulatory adherence, trustworthiness, and the explainability of healthcare AI systems. While such frameworks have expanded, a deficiency remains in translating policy into effective compliance mechanisms. We propose a Compliance Agentic Model (CAM) framework to help organizations comply with GenAI and machine learning (ML)-based solutions. The CAM framework establishes trustworthiness in GenAI applications used in healthcare, ensuring alignment with organizational values and ethical standards to enhance accountability and regulatory adherence.},

However, research on time-series data in the transportation field, particularly on sequence prediction across multiple time scales, remains underexplored. To leverage the multi-scale characteristics of time-series data, as well as its seasonal and periodic features, we introduce two solutions based on DLinear model: multi-scale decomposition and cross-scale information fusion, and propose a traffic prediction model named MIFNetwork. We conduct comparative experiments on several traffic datasets, selecting transformer-based models with strong time-series modeling capabilities for comparison. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other approaches, especially in handling long time spans and complex trend changes.},

A novel approach to this problem is the Trend Decomposition Enhanced Large Language Model for Non-Static Network Traffic Prediction (TD-LLM). Applying trend decomposition as the preparation approach, the proposed strategy first divides raw information into resolved and non-fixed parts. The predetermined portion is standardized and processed, implementing a multi-head cross-attention mechanism, while a better self-attention mechanism improves the non-stationary element. Prompt engineering is used to create specially designed causes that serve as a guideline for the design throughout the forecast process. Finally, the processed data and creates are integrated into the large language model to produce the predicted results. In contrast to foundation models like Time- LLM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer, the TD-LLM type drastically reduces mean squared error for network traffic prediction across many regions, according to exploratory evaluations, with decreases of 19.73 \%, 54.71 \%, 76.88 \%, and 61.48 \%, respectively.},

 abstract = {Shipboard emergencies can easily induce secondary events because of any time and space transition. Carrier-based aircraft emergencies have complexity, tight coupling and strong real-time characteristics. Therefore, it is of great significance to reasonably predict the development trend of the incident in the emergency treatment to reduce the harm. Due to the sudden and random nature of naval battlefield accidents, some incidents are not covered by the historical case base. Traditional retrieval approaches to event prediction using case knowledge are limited by the sparsity of events and the cold-start problem. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-graph neural network for event development trend prediction, which disassembles events into event features and introduces the shipboard aircraft domain knowledge graph. We produce a data set around the event features of carrier-based aircraft on the simulation platform. The results show that the graph neural network with knowledge graph is superior in modeling the higher-order semantic association between event features. Compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods, our approach exhibits significant improvements.},

 abstract = {Transformer have been widely used in the field of natural language processing due to their excellent performance, but the high computational cost and large parameter scale limit the efficiency of actual deployment. As an effective model compression technique, model distillation constructs small-scale student models from large models through knowledge transfer, significantly reducing resource requirements. However, there is a risk of information leakage during the distillation process of the model. This article deeply analyzes the potential mechanisms of information leakage in the distillation process of Transformer, including data reproduction attacks, reverse inference attacks, and other issues. In response to the above risks, a method combining differential privacy technology with secure multi-party computation was proposed for protection, and its effectiveness was verified through experiments. Research has shown that this method can significantly reduce the risk of information leakage while ensuring model performance.},

 abstract = {Pre-trained language models based on deep neural networks have achieved superior performance in Chinese spelling correction. However, these models are heavily dependent on the size and quality of the training corpus and exhibit poor performance when faced with unknown errors. Inspired by adversarial learning, this paper focuses on Chinese character input scenarios and propose an effective attack strategy to generate more valuable training examples in these scenarios. This strategy jointly utilizes the attention mechanism and the logit output to determine the attack position and generates misspelling instances in a perturbed pinyin manner. The generated adversarial samples are then gradually added to the training set to train the model. Further, this paper explores the effect of the proportion of samples in the adversarial training process on model performance. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy are demonstrated on three different architectural baseline models.},

 abstract = {Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims to address incomplete facts in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). As a mainstream approach for KGC, text-based methods are limited in performance due to insufficient knowledge caused by constraints in fine-tuning data. To incorporate broader external knowledge, some researchers explored KGC approaches based on large language models (LLMs), but general-purpose LLMs lack direct awareness of knowledge graph domain knowledge, making it challenging for them to independently perform KGC tasks. To balance the dependence of text-based methods on knowledge graph domain knowledge and LLMs on external knowledge, we propose Collaborative Enhancement using Large Language Model for KGC (ColKGC). We define the prompt template to implement the interaction between the text-based model and the LLMs, and divide the knowledge graph completion process into two stages. In the concept enhancement stage, we supplement the fine-tuning data by interacting with the prompts of the LLMs to enrich the graph domain knowledge learned by the text-based model. In completion inference stage, we adopted the iterative interaction strategy, taking the text-based model output as the prompt and taking the interaction content of the previous stage as the context to enhance the inference, which improved the LLMs' understanding of the KGC task. Our experiments demonstrate that ColKGC achieves superior results across various standard knowledge graph benchmarks. Extensive experiments also bear out ColKGC's efectiveness in generated data and the iterative interaction framework in assisting LLMs reasoning.},

 abstract = {While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various general tasks, developing domain-specific model remains an urgent need. This requires fine-tuning with high-quality data. Extraction of question-answer (QA) pairs from domain knowledge documents is a crucial prerequisite for fine-tuning, especially when these documents containing complex charts and unstructured data. This paper introduces a framework for extracting QA pairs from charts, which combines OCR and VLM to fully leverage contextual information in the documents and generate deep, contextually relevant questions. Our method first uses OCR for initial chart recognition, followed by a VLM-based “Caption-Reflection'' paradigm to reduce misrecognition. We then design a context localization module which combines local and global contexts to generate relevant QA pairs. Additionally, we construct a specialized chart knowledge base to guide the generation of QA pairs. Experimental results show significant improvement in both chart recognition performance and QA pairs generation quality: the average precision increases from 0.52 to 0.90, the average F1 Score improves from 0.64 to 0.94, the average FPR decreases from 0.55 to 0 respectively. The generated QA pairs perform well in terms of statistical relevance and contextual consistency.},

 abstract = {Audio-driven talking-face synthesis is of significant importance in various application scenarios, such as remote meetings, AR/VR, and digital humans. Currently, the work in this field can be broadly divided into two categories: implicit representation-based methods and explicit representation-based methods. Implicit representation-based methods often use neural network models to represent human face. For example, NeRF (Neural Radiance Field) uses MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to represent human face, and by inputting the camera pose, NeRF renders a face image from that viewpoint. When training with audio features, it can render face images with different facial movements. However, due to the lack of editability and slow rendering speed of implicit representations, the industry has been exploring new representation methods. Explicit representation-based methods commonly use 3D Gaussian representations of the face, which offers high editability and nearly real-time rendering speed, making these methods surpass implicit-based approaches in many metrics. However, it is difficult to incorporate other signals during the rendering optimization process. To address this issue, this paper combines 3D Gaussian representations with the 3D head model FLAME (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions). The FLAME model represents the face's shape and facial movements with a set of parameters. In this paper, audio signals are first transformed into parameters representing facial movements, which are used to initialize the 3D model generated by the parameters, followed by rendering optimization. This paper proposes a 3D Gaussian-based audio-driven lip-sync video generation system. It consists of two main modules: the audio-to-facial movement module and the 3D Gaussian rendering module. The audio-to-facial movement module uses the extracted audio features to generate parameters that control the FLAME model, converting the audio input into natural and reasonable lip shapes and facial movements. The 3D Gaussian rendering module initializes the 3D Gaussian with the FLAME model, optimizes the rendered image from coarse to fine, and finally stitches the generated images together to create a continuous video. Experiments show that this system can generate lip-synchronized, accurate, high-fidelity videos.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence is challenging many areas, including insurance. Insurers who want to secure the highest customer satisfaction level and service quality can no longer ignore the necessity of personal intelligent customer service. But, on the flip side, these existing systems still have problems with comprehensive knowledge, human-like dialogue, and actual estimation. This paper presents a technique for developing personalized dialogue in intelligent customer service applications to the insurance business. Our model establishes an insurance knowledge base and utilizes the retrieval-augmented generation approach. In addition, we create dynamic memory by connecting the long short-term memory module, allowing the system to retrieve and modify customer's information while interacting with them in real time. As a result, intelligent models offer much more natural and engaging conversations, adjusting to specific tones and retaining individual emotions. These virtual assistants customize the responses according to the customer profiles. Hence, they give appropriate, professional, and personalized insurance advice.},

 abstract = {Graph classification has significant applications in various domains, including chemical molecular structure prediction, social network analysis, recommendation systems, and biological network analysis, and has received considerable attention in recent years. However, real-world graph datasets often exhibit class imbalance, where the disproportionate distribution of classes can cause models to favor the majority class, reducing prediction accuracy for minority classes. Notably, minority or anomalous classes often hold unique value in many practical scenarios. This paper proposes a framework for graph classification under category imbalance named Generator Imbalanced Graph Classification(GIGC). GIGC employs a set of learnable augmented graph generators orchestrated by an automated augmentation strategy to enhance minority-class graphs. This approach increases the diversity of minority-class samples, balances the dataset's class distribution, and improves the model's generalization capabilities. Simultaneously, k-reciprocal nearest neighbors are utilized to capture inter-graph relationships more effectively, leveraging the properties of symmetry and reciprocity. Subsequently, Graph-of-Graph Neural Networks are used to model inter-graph relationships, capturing global associations between graphs at a higher level. This enables the model to better capture and utilize inter-graph information. By leveraging the latent connections between minority-class graphs and other graphs, GIGC enriches the representation of minority-class graphs, mitigating the negative effects of class imbalance on classification performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that GIGC outperforms baseline methods in graph classification. Specifically, F1-macro and F1-micro are improved by at least 1.12\% and 2.62\%, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of GIGC in addressing class imbalance in graph classification tasks.},

Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been applied to emotion recognition due to its good temporal and spatial resolution. How to capture the correlation of long-distance time-series EEG signal data from both temporal and spatial dimensions and directly affect the effect of emotion recognition is a difficulty in the BCI research. Transformer model can extract long-term correlations of time-series signals. In this paper, a new electroencephalogram emotion recognition method based on spatiotemporal fusion Vision Transformer is proposed. The feature of EEG signals is reconstructed by the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) method. The spatiotemporal correlation between the acquisition channel and the temporal signal is established by position coding for the convolved features. The hybrid model of multiscale convolutional and Vision Transformer (MC-ViT) is utilized for feature extraction and emotion classification. The EEG emotion recognition method based on spatio-temporal fusion vision transformer proposed in this paper has achieved good EEG emotion classification effect on the SEED dataset, which outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods.},

 abstract = {Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning, as it leverages multiple MRI modalities to provide complementary diagnostic information. However, missing modalities are frequently en- countered in clinical practice due to factors such as image degradation, artifacts, protocol inconsistencies, or patient con- traindications to contrast agents. While certain unified models are designed to accommodate various missing modality scenarios, their performance declines markedly when multiple modalities are absent, particularly in cases where only a single modality is available. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a Guided- learning Network that leverages dynamic FFT filters. This network trains multiple specialized models designed for different missing modality scenarios, achieving outstanding performance. The architecture comprises two distinct learning paths: one dedicated to capturing multimodal information and another focused on generating modality-specific representations for the missing modality. A guided-learning strategy connects these two paths. Initially, the multimodal path is trained and its parameters are locked, enabling the missing modality path to learn under its guidance. The training process incorporates several key com- ponents: adversarial learning to align high-level features across paths, frequency-domain adaptive filtering using dynamic FFT filters to extract global features, and mutual information transfer to ensure critical information is retained even when modality data is missing. Experiments conducted on the BraTS2018 dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms comparable state-of- the-art methods in all missing modality cases.},

 abstract = {Clinical diagnosis has become easier because of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since detailed images of soft tissues are possible. While having its own advantages MRI has multiple limitations. MRI machines are generally expensive, and extended scan time can (over)burden clinical healthcare systems at the expense of medical work efficiency. The rise of deep learning technologies has spurred the development of methods to accelerate MRI reconstruction. In this regard, we introduce a novel cold-diffusion-based approach to accelerate MRI reconstruction. This method leverages the Swin Transformer architecture for effective feature extraction and incorporates a high-frequency self-attention mechanism to improve the recovery of high-frequency components, thus enhancing image quality. Unlike traditional diffusion models that rely on Gaussian noise, our cold-diffusion model simulates data loss through specific degradation processes like Cartesian undersampling. Experimental results demonstrate that the Swin-CDMR approach outperforms existing techniques in reconstruction quality, achieving superior structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores while maintaining robustness across varying acceleration factors (AF).},

 abstract = {This paper presents an Android certificate validation vulnerability detection framework that integrates static analysis, adversarial sample training, and optimization via large language models. Centered around the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network, the framework aims to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of static detection models against complex and obfuscated attack patterns. Static analysis is performed on 2,000 popular Android applications from the androzoo dataset, with code and configuration features extracted, focusing on certificate-related API usage, permission declarations, and network security settings. Among them, 110 APKs are identified as containing high-risk certificate misconfigurations. Based on these features, a Transformer-based model is constructed for feature vectorization and vulnerability identification. To further improve model robustness, WGAN is employed to generate adversarial samples that mimic real-world evasive vulnerabilities, which are used for adversarial training. Additionally, large language models are used to perform In-Context Learning, enabling semantic filtering, sample refinement, and iterative generator feedback. This results in a closed-loop, self-improving detection pipeline that combines detection, optimization, and feedback. Experimental results across standard, adversarial, and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves an F1 score of 0.91 and reduces the false positive rate to 7.2\%, significantly outperforming traditional static detection tools in both accuracy and resilience.},

 abstract = {Line detection is an important task in computer vision, which is widely used in fields such as automated driving and remote sensing image processing. As a classical image processing method, Hough transform has strong robustness and anti-interference ability in line detection. In this paper, line detection based on Hough transform is implemented and accelerated to hardware implementation on High-Level Synthesis (HLS) platform. By performing edge detection on the input image, the Hough transform maps the image from Cartesian space to parameter space to detect line features in the image. Experimental results show that the method can accurately detect lines in the image while exhibiting strong noise rejection. The implementation not only improves the efficiency of line detection, but also provides an effective solution for hardware acceleration applications based on the Hough transform.},

Traditional contact-based measurement methods face significant limitations in high temperature and extreme environments, such as safety risks, inaccurate measurements due to interference with the environment, and short equipment life. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative non-contact measurement method using a visual depth estimation technique based on deep learning. The MiDaS model captures an image of a liquid metal surface by a monocular camera in an industrial environment. A deep neural network then estimates their depth by processing these images. By calculating the vertical distance between the liquid metal level point and a predefined reference point, real-time and accurate monitoring of the liquid level height is realized. This study not only introduces a new non-contact solution for measuring the height of liquid metal surfaces, but also enhances the potential applications of deep learning in industrial vision measurement and depth estimation.},

Finally, the intelligent and precise detection of chlormequat chloride and paraquat is implemented in a regression model constructed through the sensor array combined with machine learning and deep learning. In this experiment, the lowest detection limits for chlormequat chloride and paraquat detected are 0.03 mg/L and 0.003 mg/L, respectively.

To best of our knowledge, few studies have explored auto detection of sleep spindles based on crowdsourced datasets. MODA is the only crowdsourcing spindle annotation open access dataset until now, and this study utilized the MODA dataset to further enhance the automatic detection of sleep spindles using conventional neural network (CNN) and innovative label optimization module. To evaluate our model, we proposed and conducted two analysis methods including analysis by sample-event and by subject. Meanwhile, to validate our performance of our model, SUMO and EXP were considered as control and gold standard methods respectively; and various metrics related to by sample-event and by subject were compared among our model, SUMO and EXP. The results from analysis by sample-event showed that F1 score, Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and Cohen's Kappa coefficient in our model were significantly higher than in SUMO under all overlap thresholds. Specifically, under a higher threshold of 0.6, F1, MCC and Kappa reached 0.82, 0.81, 0.81 in our model, 0.75, 0.74, 0.74 in SUMO, respectively. For analysis by subject, all spindle features extraction of our model were comparable to the EXP, including density (4.48 in our model vs 3.80 in EXP), duration (0.79 vs 0.84), amplitude (29.91 vs 30.09) and frequency (13.04 vs 12.92). However, the spindle density extracted by SUMO was significantly different from EXP (9.04 in SUMO vs 3.80 in EXP). In conclusion, our results suggested that the crowdsourced public dataset and label optimization module can further enhance the spindle detection capability of the convolutional neural network.},

 abstract = {Spectrum anomaly detection involves identifying abnormal signals within the electromagnetic spectrum. Most existing methods focus on traditional abnormal signals and can achieve high detection rates through training and testing of neural network models. However, the presence of adversarial samples greatly reduces the performance of existing network models. To address this issue, a spectrum anomaly detection algorithm based on attention mechanism residual neural network is proposed, which can significantly improve the robustness of network models without adversarial training. This method integrates the attention mechanism module and the Residual Network (ResNet), using ResNet18 to process spectrogram data, avoiding gradient vanishing and overfitting during iteration, and using attention mechanism to enhance the model's attention to local information in spectrogram data. The experimental results show that the predictive performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to the compared algorithms. Compared with ResNet18 and feature transformation based image retrieval adversarial defense algorithms, the new algorithm has increased the AUC value for abnormal signal detection by approximately 47\% and 24\%, respectively, effectively improving the robustness of the network model and reducing the negative impact of adversarial samples on the neural network model. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the residual neural network model based on attention mechanism.},

 abstract = {With the continuous development of blockchain technology, an increasing number of scholars have begun to consider the harm of data leakage during on-chain transactions and the requirement for privacy data protection. Zero-knowledge range proof, as a cryptographic technology, can perform legitimacy verification of data while hiding private data, effectively realizing the protection of private data on the blockchain, so it is increasingly used to protect blockchain privacy. The mainstream construction methods for range proofs can be mainly divided into two categories: n-ary decomposition and square decomposition. This paper introduces and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of these construction methods in detail. Then, based on these two methods, a zero-knowledge range proof scheme based on multibit split square decomposition (ZKRPMSSD) is proposed, which requires no trusted third-party setting and can achieve range proofs for arbitrary ranges. The proposed ZKRPMSSD scheme processes the original data based on the multibit split idea, and the acquisition method of secret value components is optimized so that the acquisition of components does not depend on the scale of the original problem. Additionally, the algorithms for proof generation and verification in the ZKRPMSSD scheme are redesigned based on the (Sigma ) protocol and Pedersen commitments, effectively reducing the computational cost of the proof generation and verification process. Finally, typical n-ary decomposition and square decomposition zero-knowledge range proof construction schemes are taken for comparative analysis. Under 256-bit security and the same problem scale, experimental results indicate that ZKRPMSSD has advantages in proof and verification time costs.},

It also aims to explore whether a machine learning-based chat agent is capable of accomplishing all the tasks precisely, or whether it could be optimized by collaborating with other simple agents. This paper establishes a chatbot environment along with a series of agents (machine learning agent, grammar checker agent, spelling checker agent, restaurant searcher), designed to assist users in finding a restaurant mainly based on what transportation they use and if a restaurant is found, the chatbot could display the route to this place in the prompt also with map details by employing the Google map API. The machine learning agent acting as the brain of this chatbot, could not only be able to evoke other agents corresponding to users’ input but also could directly store what kinds of transportation are taken by users and pass to Google map API to search appropriate restaurants instead of fully relying on a restaurant searcher agent (rule-based agent). To examine whether multiple agents coordinate with each other could outperform a single agent. A contrast experiment is conducted to conclude the result, which involves 15 participants who run through this program under two different setups (with and without spelling and grammar checkers) and each of them would give a query to this chatbot but this query would be dealt with and without spelling and grammar checker respectively. The result would be quantitatively evaluated by two metrics: Success Rate: successfully finding a restaurant and showing the map; the Total of Queries. Results suggest that pre-processing input with spelling and grammar checkers significantly improves the chatbot's performance, achieving an 80\% success rate (12 out of 15 queries). In contrast, when input is not pre-processed, the success rate drops to 46.66\% (7 out of 15 queries). This indicates that the involvement of spelling and grammar checker agents enhances the accuracy and efficiency of restaurant searches, making the collaborative multi-agent setup more effective. Moreover, it could demonstrate that this chatbot environment is well constructed since it could successfully provide suitable restaurants given users’ requirements.},

 abstract = {At present, network security becomes more and more important, but the security vulnerability data in various databases are relatively dispersed and it is difficult to establish the connection between them, network security knowledge graph can associate the security vulnerability data of different databases together, and it can be updated in real time with the latest security vulnerabilities. This paper establishes network security knowledge graph based on CAPEC, CWE and other security libraries. Aiming at the problem that TransR model cannot utilize entity semantic information, TransR-Roberta model is proposed, and splicing layer, attention layer and convolutional layer are added on the basis of TransR model. And for the problem that the quality of negative samples generated by Bernoulli negative sampling is too low, a clustering-based negative sampling optimization method is proposed. Firstly, the clustering task is accomplished with the help of Gaussian hybrid clustering algorithm on the entities in the security vulnerability knowledge graph to label the entities with clusters. In the next step, the clustered vulnerability entities are reclassified using support vector machine. Finally, a classifier combined with Facolloss function is added to the loss function of the TransR model, which is used to improve the ability of the knowledge inference model to distinguish between positive and negative samples. The experimental results show that the improved model improves the hit@N, MR and MMR metrics for the knowledge reasoning task.},

Furthermore, deep learning-based traffic image classification models often become overly complex in their pursuit of higher accuracy. In the paper, we propose a deep learning model-based method for the visual detection of DDoS malicious traffic. In response to the issue of model complexity, this article has made improvements based on the EfficientNet model, especially in resource constrained environments. This article introduces CBAM into the original model to improve its ability to process global information. By replacing the loss function in the final Softmax layer of the EfficientNet model, the ability to extract image features for binary classification problems has been enhanced, resulting in improved model performance. The experimental results show that this method can effectively identify various DDoS attacks. Compared with the EfficientNet model, this method has improved accuracy, training time, and single image prediction time.},

Applications of reactive synthesis span various domains, including robot motion planning, autonomous system control, and communication protocol development. This paper investigates the reactive synthesis for formulas expressed in Real-Time Linear Dynamic Logic over finite traces (RTLDLf). RTLDLf is more expressive than Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf). While RTLDLf and Linear Dynamic Logic over finite traces (LDLf) share equivalent expressive power, RTLDLf offers greater simplicity in its logical constructs compared to LDLf. Existing synthesis methods for LDLf predominantly rely on automata-based approaches. In this paper, we propose an RTLDLf synthesis method based on temporal testers. We first translate an RTLDLf specification into a temporal tester, a non-deterministic transducer. The tester is then transformed into a graph game between the system and the environment. We finally propose a symbolic algorithm to solve the game to derive a winning strategy for the system player. The proposed method has two advantages: (1) high composability, enabling convenient and efficient synthesis of complex RTLDLf formulas, and (2) symbolic representation of the tester's transition relations and state space, which facilitates the use of efficient symbolic algorithms based on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams.},

In this model, the conventional SE module is replaced with an optimized CBAM, which uses dilated convolutions to enhance the model's sensitivity to anomalous sounds. At the same time, the model incorporates CutMix and Focal Loss as the loss function, further improving the model's robustness to imbalanced data. Additionally, to strengthen the nonlinear representation capacity of the architecture, we implement CELU activation functions as substitutes for conventional ReLU units within residual modules. According to experimental results, we can find that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 97\% in a -6dB noise environment, which is an improvement of 1.07 percentage points over the original MobileNetV3 model, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in fan anomaly detection.},

However, during the training process, models may memorize sensitive private data, posing risks to data security and privacy protection. Member Inference Attacks (MIA) aim to determine whether a specific record was used in the training of the target model. This approach is crucial for detecting privacy risks in models and has seen substantial progress in both traditional and fine-tuned models. However, this remains an unresolved issue for large language models (LLMs). Recent studies indicate that under proper experimental setups, the AUC-ROC of existing methods approaches 0.5 (random guessing). Subsequently, some research has shifted MIA to dataset inference, achieving promising results in this area. Our study shows that when fine-tuning a target model with aggregated samples, it is possible to distinguish whether these samples were used in training the target model by observing the initial loss returned by the model. Based on this observation, we propose a fine-tuning-based member inference method for large language models. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive experiments on three mainstream models and seven datasets. The results indicate that member inference attacks with aggregated samples can achieve acceptable outcomes.},

In this paper, we propose a semantic segmentation method based on a dynamic multimodal noise addition technique combined with the SegFormer model to improve the robustness of street view image segmentation in complex environments. The study takes five major roads (West Beijing Road, North Taiping Road, Changjiang Road, Yihe Road, and Central Road) in Nanjing as objects, and based on the streetscape and remote sensing data of the vegetation growth season from 2017 to 2022, the Gaussian noise, motion blur, and weather effects are simulated by the multimodal noise addition technique, which effectively improves the adaptability of the model to the dynamic interference. The experiments showed that the Green View Index analysis revealed a general upward trend of street greening (average increase of 0.94\%). Furthermore, the Kendall rank correlation analysis reveals the positive correlation between environmental factors and green visualization rate, and the influence law of environmental factors on green perception is verified. This study provides a high-precision computer vision analysis framework for urban greening planning and promotes the application of semantic segmentation models in complex urban scenes.},

This method integrates a generalized set of colors (the original dataset) in a manner that can transform the input dataset.

Although traditional disease detection methods are widely used, they generally suffer from low accuracy and complex operations, making them difficult to meet the needs of modern agriculture. In response to these problems, this article proposes a new deep learning model-LabInt. LabInt uses dual-branch independent convolution in Lab color space, which effectively reduces the impact of illumination changes on feature extraction. Through spatial reconstruction and multi-scale pooling technology, the model can deeply mine shallow disease features and use deep convolution instead of ordinary convolution to reduce computational costs and improve the model's fine-grained identification capabilities. In addition, in order to adapt to complex agricultural environments, LabInt introduces a multi-head self-attention (MHA) mechanism to dynamically enhance attention to disease characteristics and significantly reduce the interference of complex backgrounds. Experimental results show that LabInt exhibits excellent disease recognition performance in actual agricultural production environments, with key indicators such as precision and recall reaching high levels. Ablation studies show that each module makes an important contribution to model performance. Therefore, LabInt is not only innovative in theory, but also shows strong application potential in practice, and is expected to become an important tool to improve the efficiency of agricultural disease prevention and control.},

 abstract = {This article considers the role of multi-label medical image classification and the related revolution in clinical diagnosis. Here, the use of deep learning technologies brings up the problem of single-label classification methods that may not be able to deal with the multi-label one as they do not cover the complex, sometimes coexisting, multiple-pathological features in medical images. To address these challenges, we propose the CTTransNet speculative model, a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), which aims to better integrate the local features and the global context. Similarly, a Transformer decoder is used to model inter-label dependencies, and a less-weighted fusing loss mechanism is utilized to deal with the data imbalance issue. The AUC of 81.68\% on the ChestXray14 dataset is achieved by the proposed method, which shows its higher accuracy and superiority to the robustness compared to the traditional methods in multi-label medical image classification. This breakthrough thus brings about the complete information needed for a clinical diagnosis and makes it easier for personalized precision medicine to develop.},

 abstract = {With the wide deployment of deep learning models in various applications, the reliability problem of neural networks has gradually become a research hotspot. Computer systems are susceptible to single-particle effects, electromagnetic interference, and other factors in complex environments, resulting in frequent bit-flipping faults. Among them, Silent Data Corruption (SDC), as an imperceptible fault, cannot be detected by the system, which ultimately destroys the output results of neural network models. Current SDC detection techniques mainly focus on the system instruction stream level, and lack efficient methods to implement detection reinforcement at the model level. In addition, due to the black-box weight update mechanism of neural networks, traditional selective redundancy methods cannot provide a reliable explanation of which important weights to fix. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network Reinforcement Framework Based on Neural Network Interpretability (RFNI). RFNI explores the redundancy ratio of convolutional kernels by performing layer-by-layer search in convolutional neural networks through SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) agent; secondly, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated by combining with neural network interpretability algorithms; and finally, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated based on the total Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS). Second, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated by combining with the neural network interpretable algorithm; finally, the granularity configurable redundancy reinforcement is implemented based on the total floating point operations per second (FLOPS). The experimental results show that RFNI on multiple neural network architectures significantly improves the recognition accuracy in case of SDC over existing methods, and can effectively enhance the robustness of the model.},

 abstract = {With the increasing complexity and diversity of network attacks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been employed to address network intrusion detection challenges. However, the performance of these models is constrained by their reliance on a single graph construction approach. To enhance detection accuracy and adaptability to intricate attack patterns, this paper introduces a Multi-Granularity Graph Fusion-based Graph Neural Network (MGF-GNN) model. The model resolves the issue of a single granularity graph structure failing to fully capture the complex relationships and covert attack strategies in network traffic. It constructs three heterogeneous graphs at different granularities to capture traffic relationships from host-level, port-level, and protocol-level perspectives. The model employs hierarchical message passing, aggregation, and cross-graph information fusion mechanisms to strengthen its ability to learn multi-level information, thereby improving detection performance against complex attacks. MGF-GNN outperforms traditional machine learning methods and single-graph-based GNN models on the CIC-IDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 datasets, achieving significant improvements across multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Its effectiveness is primarily attributed to MGF-GNN's ability to comprehensively learn multi-dimensional perspective information through multi-granularity graph fusion.},

Traditional MARL algorithms often struggle with these two critical issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework called DDCF(Dynamic Decision Correction Framework) that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to optimize the decision-making process for agents navigating complex environments. The first key innovation of this framework is the application of LSTM networks, which enable agents to learn optimal paths over time while considering dynamic, temporal dependencies within the environment. The second key innovation is the introduction of a dynamic decision-making approach, which effectively handles the problem of incomplete information by enabling agents to make decisions based on both observable and inferred states. This decision method ensures that agents can intelligently handle uncertain environments by incorporating both certain and fuzzy information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of path optimization and decision-making performance, providing a robust solution for agents in environments characterized by incomplete information and complex decision tasks.},

Additionally, camera motion compensation (CMC) was implemented to adaptively mitigate the effects of sharp perspective changes. Test results utilizing the Visdrone dataset indicate that mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 improved by 4.4\% and 3.6\% respectively in the detection section.

 abstract = {With the increasing complexity and volume of air traffic, there is growing interest in utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) support to alleviate ATCOs’ workload. Despite this potential, AI adoption in air traffic control (ATC) has been limited, partly due to low user acceptance. This study, grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the AI Acceptance Model (AIAM), and the Technology Acceptance in the Working Environment (TAWE) model, investigates the factors influencing AI acceptance among ATCOs. Using data from an online survey of 83 ATCOS, our model explains 78.5\% of the variance in the intention to use AI. Notably, technology trust (TT) and emotion (EM) significantly influence the intention to use AI, with TT mediating the impact of perceived transparency (PT). Findings emphasize the need to address emotional and functional aspects to foster AI acceptance in ATC, marking a crucial step toward its improvement.},

 abstract = {Formal communications such as public calls, announcements, or regulations are supposed to exhibit respect for diversity in terms of gender, race, age, and disability. However, human writers often lack adequate inclusive writing skills. For instance, they tend to overuse the masculine as a neutral form, mainly because they are self-trained on biased text examples. To overcome this issue, we propose to leverage Generative Artificial Intelligence to support inclusive language writing. Focusing on formal Italian communications, we have designed and developed an AI-assisted tool for non-inclusive text detection and reformulation. Thanks to the joint work with a team of linguistic experts, we first define a set of linguistic criteria necessary to model inclusive writing forms in Italian. Based on these criteria, we collect and annotate a dataset of Italian administrative documents enriched with fine-grained inclusive annotations. Finally, we train deep learning models on the collected data for non-inclusive language detection and inclusive language reformulation tasks. We perform quantitative and human-driven evaluations on the trained models. The best detection model correctly classifies 89\% of the sentences, whereas the best reformulation model produces 73\% fully correct reformulations. Both models have been integrated into a writing assistance tool acting as a text proofreader and self-learning tool for non-expert writers, namely Inclusively. Once a non-inclusive piece of text is detected, the proposed approach suggests inclusive reformulations. The tool also provides explanations of the models’ outputs to increase system transparency. Furthermore, it allows expert end-users to provide further annotations for system fine-tuning. The trained models and the writing assistance tool are publicly available for research purposes.},

 abstract = {The curricular design of programs in Higher Education is increasingly oriented towards competence-based learning goals in order to provide more specific and explicit qualifications. At the same time the descriptions of competences are mostly based on textual descriptions often in informal style targeted towards different audiences making descriptions vague and harder to compare. Formal models for the specification of competences exist for some time and even semantic models are being developed, e.g., the European Learning Model. These different approaches lead to a gap between formal and informal competence descriptions that require manual efforts of curriculum designer to maintain. This research borrows the concept of Deep and Surface representation models from the field of linguistics to unify the different approaches. Additionally, it focuses on the functionality of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the form of Large Language Models to close the aforementioned gap. It demonstrates the potential of the technology in both directions and discusses application potential of the concept.},

While their superior performance offers considerable benefits, their inherent complexity often decreases human trust, which slows their application in high-risk decision-making domains, such as finance. The field of explainable AI (XAI) seeks to bridge this gap, aiming to make AI models more understandable. This survey, focusing on published work from 2018 to 2024, categorizes XAI approaches that predict financial time series. In this article, explainability and interpretability are distinguished, emphasizing the need to treat these concepts separately, as they are not applied the same way in practice. Through clear definitions, a rigorous taxonomy of XAI approaches, a complementary characterization, and examples of XAI’s application in the finance industry, this article provides a comprehensive view of XAI’s current role in finance. It can also serve as a guide for selecting the most appropriate XAI approach for future applications.},

 abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has propelled a new paradigm in the generation of digital art, bringing new pedagogical practices regarding personalization and emotional growth in the classroom. This paper proposes the Emotion-Art Prompt Framework (EAPF) which provides a systematic link between Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions and L\"{o}vheim's three-dimensional model with basic underlying elements of art — form, color, light/shadow, and composition to facilitate drawing generation in an AI setting. This paper describes a new system architecture that autonomously maps layered emotional descriptors onto structured prompts interfacing with the Tencent Yuanbao AI drawing platform. Through a large-scale experiment involving more than 800 students (aged 10–12) in Shenzhen (China), we assessed quantitative and qualitative data embedded in emotional alignment, creative engagement, and platform suitability. Our findings show that EAPF substantially improves the emotional expressiveness of AI-generated works of art, while offering data-based insights for educators to tailor art teaching to individual student preferences. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of well-designed prompt engineering to overcome accessibility barriers in traditional art education while enhancing emotional development. Additionally, it proposes a scalable model for integrating AI technologies into K–12 creative learning.},

A questionnaire survey was conducted on 300 individuals in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and other cities, and quantitative technology was used to conduct data statistics and inspections on the access to artificial intelligence of various social classes. High-income groups clearly occupy an advantageous position in the access and application of artificial intelligence technology. Their access frequency, application depth and technology dependence are far greater than those of low-income groups. Data analysis shows that there are significant differences in the adoption and application of artificial intelligence technology among social classes. Groups with weak economic foundations face the difficulties of lack of education and resources, and face a large technical threshold for technology access. They are at a disadvantage in the application of technology.},

 abstract = {This paper first conducts a regression analysis on the direct effect of artificial intelligence on the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry, and then uses the panel threshold model to explore the threshold effect of artificial intelligence on the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. The Hausman test confirms the rationality of the fixed effect regression model, indicating that artificial intelligence has a significant positive impact on the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. Subsequently, the panel threshold model is used for analysis, and it is found that there is a double threshold effect, with the first threshold value being 6.5575 and the second being 14.4800. The marginal effect of the improvement of artificial intelligence level on high-quality development shows a rapid increase at first, a slowdown after crossing the first threshold, and an acceleration again after crossing the second threshold. This nonlinear relationship is further verified through the adjustment ratio change and internal validity test for robustness. The results show that high-end and low-end manufacturing enterprises are more likely to benefit from artificial intelligence technology due to advantages in cost-effectiveness, market demand, and technological adaptability, thereby promoting their high-quality development. In contrast, mid-range manufacturing enterprises may face a series of challenges, resulting in less significant or even inhibitory effects of artificial intelligence technology on them.},

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising approach for implementing energy-efficient Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in embedded systems. In this article, we present ModNEF, an open-source, neuromorphic digital hardware architecture designed for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). ModNEF is based on a modular architecture, where independent modules communicate via point-to-point connections to emulate SNNs. Our architecture offers two neuron models based on the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) model, with a different emulation strategy. The modular nature of ModNEF allows researchers to extend the architecture by developing new modules to emulate different types of neurons or implement online learning rules. ModNEF is a clock-driven emulator, meaning that the neuron state is updated at regular intervals, even in the absence of input data. We evaluated the performance of the emulator using the MNIST and NMNIST datasets, with offline, full-precision training.},

 abstract = {Advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) hold great promise for automating radiology workflows, yet challenges in interpretability and reliability hinder clinical adoption. This paper presents an automated radiology report generation framework that combines Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) with a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to bridge AI performance with clinical explainability. CBMs map chest X-ray features to human-understandable clinical concepts, enabling transparent disease classification. Meanwhile, the RAG system integrates multi-agent collaboration and external knowledge to produce contextually rich, evidence-based reports. Our demonstration showcases the system’s ability to deliver interpretable predictions, mitigate hallucinations, and generate high-quality, tailored reports with an interactive interface addressing accuracy, trust, and usability challenges. This framework provides a pathway to improving diagnostic consistency and empowering radiologists with actionable insights.},

 abstract = {The emergence of foundational models and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is poised to transform productivity in scientific computing, especially in code development, refactoring, and translating from one programming language to another. However, because the output of GenAI cannot be guaranteed to be correct, manual intervention remains necessary. Some of this intervention can be automated through task-specific tools, alongside additional methodologies for correctness verification and effective prompt development. We explored the application of GenAI in assisting with code translation, language interoperability, and codebase inspection within a legacy Fortran codebase used to simulate particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the process, we developed a tool, CodeScribe, which combines prompt engineering with user supervision to establish an efficient process for code conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate how CodeScribe assists in converting Fortran code to C++, generating Fortran-C APIs for integrating legacy systems with modern C++ libraries, and providing developer support for code organization and algorithm implementation. We also address the challenges of AI-driven code translation and highlight its benefits for enhancing productivity in scientific computing workflows.},

 abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence technology, generative AI models such as GPT are now increasingly used in education. Studies have found that these models have great potential in improving students' innovation ability, especially in cultivating students' creative thinking and problem-solving abilities. However, we found that the current traditional teaching methods are still somewhat lacking in cultivating students' innovation and creativity. For example, many students are not well prepared and answer questions when facing complex real-life problems. This time, our research mainly wants to see whether the tasks designed based on GPT can effectively improve undergraduate students' creativity. At the same time, we use the support vector machine (SVM) model for quantitative evaluation. We designed four specific tasks to examine students' performance from the core dimensions of innovation, namely creative thinking, problem solving, knowledge integration, and teamwork. The experimental results show that GPT has a significant effect on improving students' creative thinking (task one) and problem solving (task two), especially in the problem-solving task. We also compared the scores predicted by the model with the actual scores and found that the two were very consistent, which shows that GPT can indeed help students better diverge their thinking and analyze problems. In addition, this study also verified the feasibility of using support vector machines to quantitatively evaluate students' innovation ability. In general, GPT combined with machine learning models such as SVM may become a valuable tool in the future in improving students' creativity, problem-solving ability, and even overall innovation performance.},

In this study, a chatbot named C4D Helper was developed by using Coze, a chatbot creation platform in China like Google's Dialogflow. A chatbot-assisted learning model was designed based on the Design Thinking framework to cultivate students' higher-order thinking skills. In order to examine the effectiveness of this model, a pre-posttest quasi-experiment lasting for 5 weeks was conducted. The students in two classes, majoring in Digital Media Technology at Kashi University, were randomly assigned to control group(CG, n=31) and experimental group (EG, n=31). Students in CG learned by traditional teaching model while students in EG learned by chatbot-assisted learning model. The results showed that the chatbot-assisted learning model can significantly improve higher-order thinking skills, including problem-solving skills, critical thinking, creative thinking, and cooperation skills.},

The industrial internet is booming. However, due to the increasing complexity of the network environment and various types of cyber attacks, there are huge challenges for the industrial internet. Traditional network security devices adopt isolated protection measures and cannot achieve information sharing, which can only reflect the security of the network from one side. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the current security status of the industrial internet and a prediction of its safety development trend over a certain period are the important directions for the development of industrial internet security.

 abstract = {This study looks into the best approaches for government subsidies to promote the spread of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare. It examines two different subsidy strategies and creates an evolutionary game model of AI medical technology diffusion in the context of a Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) network. The two subsidy strategies are analyzed in detail, factoring in the maturity of the technology, the initial proportion of firms, and the initial proportion of hospitals. The study finds that: 1) Government subsidies fixed in advance negatively affect technology diffusion when the maturity of the technology is uncertain. 2) Increased proportion of high-share hospitals increased the spread of AI technology because the enhanced market share benefits the firms using AI technology which causes them to attract other firms to copy that strategy. 3) From the perspective of the uncertainty of effectiveness, the adaptive subsidies perform better than fixed subsidies across all scenarios. 4) A higher initial proportion of hospitals using AI results in greater spreads of AI technology. The governments are recommended to use adaptive subsidies and to focus support on hospitals in order to reduce the barriers to entry. The government should also provide infrastructure and establish more higher-level hospitals to allow for the more effective use of resources.},

The functional imaging capabilities of PET/CT and MRI help doctors evaluate suspicious metastatic lymph nodes and separate tumors from atelectasis or inflammation through metabolic and microstructural information. Deep learning algorithms enable radiomics models to extract image-based high-dimensional features which predict local control rates and survival outcomes and other clinical results. The current implementation of AI-assisted multimodal imaging in NSCLC radiotherapy faces multiple challenges including non-standardized data and inadequate model interpretability and insufficient clinical workflow integration. Further radiomics and multi-omics research needs urgent attention especially when radiotherapy combines with immunotherapy or targeted therapy. The future development requires three main steps: enhancing large-scale multicenter data sharing for external validation and developing interpretable AI algorithms and individualized adaptive radiotherapy strategies while promoting standardized clinical AI-assisted multimodal imaging applications to achieve precise and efficient NSCLC radiotherapy.},

 abstract = {The remarkable advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has driven revolutionary applications for text-to-image generation, like Stable Diffusion and Imagen. Especially, the diffusion model can generate stunning images from natural language descriptions by using a reverse continuous denoising process. However, the computation burden of diffusion model-based GenAI services poses a significant hurdle for their practical implementation. In this work, we propose a novel edge computing-assisted GenAI framework to enable efficient GenAI service provision, where the intermediate output generated by diffusion models can be cached on edge servers and reused by various users to improve edge computing resource utilization. Assuming the existence of causally correlated auxiliary information, a long-term caching problem is formulated under intra-time-slot caching constraints by considering various maximally reusable steps of diffusion model-based GenAI tasks and the available caching capacity at edge servers. By leveraging the Lyapunov optimization framework, we transform the time-average caching problem into several deterministic problems for different time slots. We develop a deep reinforcement learning-based caching (DRC) algorithm to obtain caching decisions in each time slot, where a deep neural network (DNN)-based caching action generation module and a model-based evaluation module are designed. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation experiments by comparing the DRC algorithm with benchmark algorithms. The simulation results depict that the proposed DRC algorithm can reduce response time and improve cache hit rates significantly. The code is available at https://gitee.com/pipihinsky/DRC.},

In this study, we explore the accessibility and usability of the interfaces of four popular AI-based tools via screen readers through a combination of semi-automated evaluations and inspections conducted by both sighted and blind accessibility experts and screen readers with more than 20 years of experience. Navigation, labeling of control elements, feedback mechanisms, and prompt handling were considered in the study. The results point to usability difficulties in all tools, particularly in navigation structure, clarity of feedback and interactive elements. Although this work empirically explores the accessibility of AI-based tools it brings out the first critical issues that deserve further investigation. However, they are based on a small group of experts and thus should be considered preliminary and useful for future studies.},

 abstract = {The increasing complexity of AI systems has led to the growth of the field of Explainable AI (XAI), which aims to provide explanations and justifications for the outputs of AI algorithms. While there is considerable demand for XAI, there remains a scarcity of studies aimed at comprehensively understanding the practical distinctions among different methods and effectively aligning each method with users’ individual needs, and ideally, offer a mapping function which can map each user with its specific needs to a method of explainability. This study endeavors to bridge this gap by conducting a review of the relevant works in XAI, with a specific focus on Explainable Machine Learning (XML), and a keen eye on user needs to provide an observational study. Our main objective is to offer a classification of XAI methods within the realm of XML, categorizing current works into three distinct domains: philosophy, theory, and practice. Moreover, our study seeks to facilitate the connection between XAI users and the most suitable methods for them and tailor explanations to meet their specific needs by proposing a mapping function that take to account users and their desired properties and suggest an XAI method to them. This entails an examination of prevalent XAI approaches and an evaluation of their properties. The primary outcome of this study is the formulation of a clear and concise strategy for selecting the optimal XAI method to achieve a given goal, all while delivering personalized explanations tailored to individual users.},

 abstract = {Image generation using generative artificial intelligence has become a popular activity. However, text-to-image generation—where images are produced from typed prompts—can be less engaging in public settings since the act of typing tends to limit interactive audience participation, thereby reducing its suitability for designing dynamic public installations. In this article, we explore body prompting as input modality for image generation in the context of public event settings. Body prompting extends interaction with generative AI beyond textual inputs to reconnect the creative act of image generation with the physical act of creating artworks. We implement this concept in an interactive art installation, Artworks Reimagined, designed to transform existing artworks via body prompting. We deployed the installation at an event with hundreds of visitors in a public and private setting. Our semi-structured interviews with a sample of visitors (N = 79) show that body prompting was well-received and provides an engaging and fun experience. We present insights into participants’ experience of body prompting and AI co-creation and identify three distinct strategies of embodied interaction focused on re-creating, reimagining, or casual interaction. We provide valuable recommendations for practitioners seeking to design interactive generative AI experiences in museums, galleries, and public event spaces.},

The study identifies three methods of cultural translation: direct translation, consecutive translation, and indirect translation. The study utilizes these frameworks in examining innovative solutions to expressing Henan's regional culture in modern cultural products. It demonstrates how to achieve cultural dissemination and inheritance and enhance cultural identity and global influence in the context of globalization. The study also examines the potential of AI-based image generation in cultural creative design, thus offering a new framework for perceiving and examining the role of computer technology in cultural translation and innovation.},

The results show that when the number of principal components is 3, the cumulative contribution rate of the principal components reaches 86.483\%, and the contribution rates of the three principal components are 65.084\%, 11.702\%, 9.097\%, and the eigenvalues of the three principal components are all greater than 1. Then the three principal components are used as the input layer to build the compressive strength model of cemented gravel based on PCA-BPNN, and the RMSEs of the training set and test set are 0.253 and 0.28, respectively. The RMSE of the training set and the test set are 0.253 and 0.286, and the R2 is 0.947 and 0.942, which are not much different from the BPNN model with the number of nodes in the input layer of 6 and 11 before dimensionality reduction, and they are obviously better than the BPNN model in the convergence speed and training time. It can be seen that the PCA-BPNN model has good prediction effect and prediction efficiency, especially drastically reducing the training time, which provides a new idea for the prediction research of the mechanical properties of cemented gravel.},

 abstract = {Depression is a big public health problem around the world. Like the traditional methods of screening, clinical assessments, and self-rating scales are among the limits. These methods are based on the subjectivity of patient reports and the experience of doctors and clearly can have bias. In addition, they do not permit real-time monitoring of changes in mood. For this reason, this field of mental health is challenged with accurately and efficiently detecting probable mood changes in individuals at risk for depression. To resolve these challenges, we then propose a BERT-based sentimental analysis model adapted for depression-related text. Current methods for screening for traditional depression and established sentiment analysis models are hindered by data scarcity, data imbalance, and the problems of deriving emotional changes in a dynamic and clean manner. To leverage the strengths of BERTs in our model, we train the last layer of BERTs and then construct a classification layer tailored to the depressive emotion, which is more sensitive to the semantic information of the mood. Moreover, we also present data augmentation in its simplest form, which is the rearrangement of positive samples to increase the diversity of samples while still preserving the semantic meaning. To tackle data imbalance, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism to the BCEWithLogitsLoss function by adjusting the weight of the positive samples with data distribution. The model effectively captures the complex emotional changes by combining global and local semantic dynamic representations. In our empirical study, we analyze the open-source dataset of interview transcripts of 162 volunteers. Our model is evaluated using the experimental results, and the precision, the recall rate, and the F1 score obtained are 0.667, 0.667, and 0.667, respectively. Our model has achieved 2.62 higher in terms of precision and F1 score as compared to the existing models. The results indicate that our model provides a big benefit in identifying screened individuals at risk for depression.},

This paper proposes a few-shot incremental relation extraction model based on consistency prototype learning and multi-layer knowledge distillation. The model consists of data augmentation, consistency prototype learning, and dual-layer knowledge distillation. First, data augmentation is applied to the training data to alleviate common overfitting problems in few-shot scenarios. Second, consistency prototype learning is utilized to regularize the embedding space and address feature distortion. Additionally, a dual-teacher model for knowledge distillation is designed to prevent catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. Experiments conducted on the TACRED dataset show that after completing all tasks under the 5-way-5-shot setting, accuracy improved by 2.22\%. Our model significantly outperforms other baseline methods, validating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

However, the existing SISR technology based on convolutional neural network (CNN) still faces great challenges in the application of resource-constrained mobile devices. For lightweight SISR, we propose a multi-level feature mixing network (MFMN), which achieves high-quality super-resolution image reconstruction at low computational cost. Based on re-parameterization, a multi-level feature generation module (MFGM) is designed to extract feature mappings from different perspectives. Then, to enhance feature details, a feature refinement module (FRM) is constructed to aggregate high-frequency information, which can assign weight values to pixels in feature maps according to the importance of different hierarchical features. Through many experiments, our proposed method shows excellent image reconstruction results in a lightweight way on multiple benchmark datasets and exceeds the current advanced methods.},

The developments in haptic technology have significantly improved the human-computer interaction. Virtual reality (VR) technology and the metaverse, which highlight personalized experience, have become hotspots of the information application industry. In VR applications, adding haptic feedback to the human-computer interaction process can make the experience more immersive. In recent years, research on virtual haptics has focused on two areas: the use of microcurrents to stimulate mechanoreceptors and the use of virtual haptics to convey information. Multi-channel tactile-force rendering permits realistic touch sensations. This is achieved by utilizing force and tactile feedback methods. It is effective for the users to feel detailed and immersive interactions. This paper presents a detailed review on the developments in microcurrent-based computational frameworks for high-resolution haptic feedback. This work also investigates the modern techniques for high resolution haptic rendering, such as the role of multi-channel simulation and computational modeling techniques. Furthermore, the applications of this technology, challenges, and future directions were elaborated.},

 abstract = {Multimodal MRI synthesis is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, particularly in glioma segmentation. However, cross-subject synthesis faces significant challenges due to the variability in brain structures and tumor morphology across individuals. Existing methods often fail to preserve tumor region fidelity, limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose the Tumor Representation Consistency Alignment Generative Adversarial Network (TRCA-GAN), a novel framework designed to enhance tumor region fidelity in cross-subject multimodal MRI synthesis. TRCA-GAN introduces two key innovations: the Region-Aware Perturbation Module (RAPM), which enhances tumor structure preservation through adaptive perturbation and joint attention mechanisms, and the Local Contrast Discriminator Module (LCDM), which improves tumor contrast fidelity via a dual physical-feature constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2021 dataset demonstrate that TRCA-GAN significantly outperforms comparison methods in terms of image generation quality and tumor segmentation accuracy. The results highlight the effectiveness of TRCA-GAN in addressing the challenges of cross-subject MRI synthesis, making it a powerful tool for clinical applications.},

 abstract = {In the contemporary flourishing digital economy, advancements in artificial intelligence are incessantly reconfiguring the capital market landscape. This study commences with the industry perturbation instigated by the DeepSeek large - model to explore the interactive mechanisms between financial public opinion and capital markets during technological innovation events. Through the comprehensive utilization of methods such as literature review, case analysis, social network analysis, and regression analysis, and drawing on 12,329 Weibo public opinion data points and high - frequency trading data from 16 A - share DeepSeek concept stocks, a novel “technology decoding – market response” dual - path model is constructed. The study reveals that technology - related public opinion gradually infiltrates the financial domain via a three - stage progression: “professional decoding – industry restructuring – investment decision - making.” Technology bloggers assume a pivotal role in information dissemination, as evidenced by an intermediary centrality of 0.29. The data further indicate that for each one - standard - deviation increment in public opinion intensity, the excess return of concept stocks surges by 1.8\% after 36 hours (p = 0.03), whereas the impact of sentiment polarity on stock prices is not statistically significant (β = 0.04, p = 0.41).Adopting an integrated perspective from journalism and behavioral finance, this research elucidates the propagation patterns of technology - related public opinion and its inherent connections with capital markets, and it formulates a “technology–finance” public opinion governance framework. These findings provide crucial theoretical underpinnings and practical guidelines for the prevention of financial risks associated with technology - related public opinion, thereby having far - reaching implications for optimizing financial market regulation and enhancing public opinion management systems.},

With participation from 248 students and 21 faculty, the study employed surveys and focus group discussions to capture participants' perceptions on AI, how AI is currently integrated into teaching, learning and assessment, and the impact of AI on these activities. The results show that both students and faculty perceive that AI is transforming higher education, and faculty are exploring AI integration in their work. However, many faculty have concerns about the negative effects of students' use of generative AI and continue to educate them on responsible use of AI for learning. Such concerns influence how faculty assess student learning reverting to in-person assessments among other strategies. Overall, the consensus is that AI is transforming higher education, and there is a need for institutions, faculty and students to adapt to this reality.},

As AI becomes increasingly pervasive, it is essential to introduce AI concepts to young children to promote their AI literacy. However, the current landscape of AI education in Uganda is not well understood. To address this gap, this research explores a community-based approach to teaching AI and machine learning (ML) to young children in out-of-school settings. The study aims to discover the kinds of AI-related knowledge and skills that young children can develop and how they can learn about AI in a non-formal educational context. The study will employ a design science methodology (DSM) to create and evaluate practical solutions, including methods, models, and concepts, that can inform AI education in Uganda. By combining systematic literature reviews, qualitative and quantitative methods, the research will generate robust empirical evidence that supports the effectiveness and relevance of the proposed solutions. Through these methods, the research will explore the role of community-based approaches in fostering young children's AI literacy. The study will investigate the effectiveness of informal learning environments, including homes, museums, churches, and children's camps. This will provide design recommendations for community-based AI education programs and in doing so, the study addresses the limited initiatives on promoting AI education for everyone, particularly in developing regions using informal settings.},

Using a panel of economic problems spanning the domains of risk, time preference, social preference, and strategic interactions, we ask human subjects to make choices for themselves and to predict the choices made by GenAI on behalf of a human user. These problems confront agents with trade-offs (e.g., higher payoff vs. earlier payoff, efficiency vs. equity, riskier but potentially higher rewards vs. safer but lower rewards) and the optimal choices depend on the agent's preferences. We find that people overestimate the degree to which GenAI choices are aligned with human preferences in general (anthropomorphic projection), and with their personal references in particular (self projection). On average, human subjects' predictions about GenAI's choices in every decision environment are much closer to the average human-subject choice than to the average GenAI choice. At the individual level, human subjects' predictions about GenAI's choices in a given environment are highly correlated with their own choices in the same environment.We explore the implications of anthropomorphic projection and self projection in a stylized theoretical model. Our theoretical analysis shows that anthropomorphic projection and self projection can lead to over-delegation to GenAI. More subtly, we also find that objectively improving AI alignment can harm agents who exhibit anthropomorphic projection (because they mistakenly adjust their delegation decisions in a detrimental fashion). Similarly, among agents who exhibit self projection, welfare may be higher for those who have more unusual preferences (since they are less likely to mistakenly delegate).The full paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14708},

 abstract = {Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice-Conversion (VC) using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have made it possible to generate high-quality and realistic human-like audio. This introduces significant challenges to distinguishing AI-synthesized speech from the authentic human voice and could raise potential issues of misuse for malicious purposes such as impersonation and fraud, spreading misinformation, deepfakes, and scams. However, existing detection techniques for AI-synthesized audio have not kept pace and often exhibit poor generalization across diverse datasets. In this article, we introduce SONAR, a synthetic AI-Audio Detection Framework and Benchmark, aiming at providing a comprehensive evaluation for distinguishing cutting-edge AI-synthesized auditory content. SONAR includes a novel evaluation dataset sourced from 9 diverse audio synthesis platforms, including leading TTS providers and state-of-the-art TTS models. It is the first framework to uniformly benchmark AI-audio detection across both traditional and foundation model-based deepfake detection systems. Through extensive experiments, (1) we reveal the generalization limitations of existing detection methods and demonstrate that foundation models exhibit stronger generalization capabilities, which can be attributed to their model size and the scale and quality of pretraining data. (2) Our evaluation of the generalization across languages suggests that speech foundation models demonstrate robust cross-lingual generalization capabilities, maintaining strong performance across diverse languages despite being fine-tuned solely on English speech data. This finding also suggests that the primary challenges in audio deepfake detection are more closely tied to the realism and quality of synthetic audio rather than language-specific characteristics. (3) We also explore the effectiveness and efficiency of few-shot fine-tuning in improving generalization, highlighting its potential for tailored applications, such as personalized detection systems for specific entities or individuals.

While previous research has explored the pedagogical applications of GenAI and the challenges faced by educators and students, there is less focus on GenAI in the context of a design education. We present findings from group interviews and a survey study conducted with interaction design bachelor students, foregrounding the attitudes and perspectives of students who are motivated to learn. We show that although students are generally aware of ethical issues surrounding GenAI, they make considered decisions on how they use it to support their learning. An insight is how the students’ pride in their own learning and accomplishment guides their use more than moralistic and disciplinary rhetoric widespread in the higher education sector. The paper concludes with thought-provoking questions to guide future steps.

With the acceleration of digital transformation in education and the development of Large Scale Models technology, applying Generative AI to PBL will provide assistance for its effective implementation. Generative AI can assist in optimizing teaching project design, support personalized exploration processes for students, and achieve multi-dimensional ability assessment of students. At present, the application of Generative AI in PBL is in the exploratory stage. This article deconstructs the application of Generative AI in project design, implementation, and evaluation.

The future needs to explore localised adaptation paths. In the future, it is necessary to explore the local adaptation path, not only to make use of AI to break through the bottleneck of large-scale education but also to prevent the alienation of the technology, and build an intelligent education ecology of “teaching in accordance with one's aptitude”.},

This is possible due to the development of the discipline in the last decades, to a state in which we have qualified people (software engineers, practitioners, and researchers), proper processes, and cutting-edge technologies. To achieve this current state, the discipline of software engineering has been advanced by private companies, open-source communities, government agencies, and universities. What do all those different institutions have in common? They have talented, smart, and creative people. The doctoral degree is the highest academic degree, focusing on educating and preparing talented, smart, and creative people. While the discipline of software engineering has seen great development, the new demands from society and the emergence of new technologies (e.g., generative artificial intelligence, quantum computing, Internet of Things) create new challenges and uncover old ones. In this context, the current generation of doctoral students will be in charge of taming such new technologies to meet the demands for the benefit of humanity. Given this crucial role of doctoral students in the future of software engineering, we need to discuss what the expectations, responsibilities, benefits, and barriers are faced by a doctoral student. In this talk, I share my experiences as a software developer, doctoral student, post-doc researcher, and professor directly working with software engineering in the past 20 years. This talk aims to inspire and guide students as they navigate the complexities and milestones of their doctoral studies.

 abstract = {Under the dual challenges of intelligent transformation and insufficient profitability of automobile manufacturing industry, the traditional financial control model is difficult to adapt to the dynamic market environment due to the problems of data silo and decision-making lag. Based on the framework of dynamic capability theory and the exploratory case of XX Automobile, this study adopts big data technology, machine learning algorithms, and combines blockchain, Internet of Things, database and other information technologies to systematically reveal the intrinsic mechanism of financial control innovation driven by the integration of industry finance and tax. The study found that: (1) Dynamic capabilities empower financial control innovation through the three phases of "sensing-capturing-reconstructing": Relying on big data technology to accurately identify the core drivers of ROE downturn, using machine learning models (decision tree, K-means clustering) to optimize the forecast of capital demand and supplier screening, and reorganizing the financial control innovation with the help of blockchain and distributed database (MongoDB), the study found that: (2) The dynamic ability of the financial management system is a key factor in financial management innovation. With the help of blockchain and distributed database (MongoDB), the company reconstructs the whole value chain process of procurement, cost and sales, and realizes the in-depth synergy of industry finance and tax data. (2) At the practical level, green bond financing reduces capital costs by 30\%, intelligent production line siting model significantly improves work efficiency and reduces carbon emissions by 117,300 tons, and RFM analysis and regression analysis accurately locate high-value customers and Belt and Road potential markets to promote export revenue growth. The conclusion of the study shows that dynamic capability theory provides an innovative path of "technology empowerment-decision optimization-strategic leap" for the integration of industry finance and tax, which not only verifies its theoretical applicability in the field of finance, but also provides a replicable practical paradigm for digital transformation of the automobile manufacturing industry, and at the same time contributes to the strategic insights of green finance and ESG governance.},

 abstract = {In the field of data privacy protection, data access is restricted by setting access privileges and authentication mechanisms. However, when data usage scenarios or access requirements change, the privilege settings need to be adjusted frequently, resulting in complex and inefficient management. Especially when dealing with large-scale distributed data, traditional methods are difficult to efficiently screen and eliminate malicious behavior clients, which further aggravates the risk of privacy leakage. Therefore, we study the optimization of data privacy protection algorithm based on distributed artificial intelligence technology. The key feature information is extracted to reflect the essential attributes of the data, in order to simplify the form of data representation. The federal learning algorithm in distributed artificial intelligence technology is used for data protection to efficiently screen and eliminate potential malicious clients. On this basis, we add appropriate amount of noise to the query process to protect the data from being leaked, and at the same time, dynamically adjust the data privacy protection algorithm and update the protection scheme in real time to cope with the changing nature of the data and its intrinsic relevance. The experimental results show that the optimization method of data privacy protection algorithm based on distributed artificial intelligence technology is significantly better than other comparative methods in reducing the possibility of privacy leakage, improving privacy protection efficiency, and reducing data loss rate. Moreover, the security and reliability of privacy data is as high as 90\%, fully verifying the superiority of the proposed method. The results indicate that this method provides an efficient, stable, and secure technical means for data privacy protection.},

 abstract = {With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a powerful tool in the field of graphic design. However, balancing the trade-off between style diversity and sample quality remains a significant challenge. This study proposes a novel framework for generating and evaluating graphic design style diversity using conditional GANs (cGANs). By incorporating regularization strategies and style embedding mechanisms, the framework allows precise control over both the style and the diversity of generated samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively generates high-quality samples in both Retro and Minimalist styles. The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) scores of 22.5 for Retro and 28.7 for Minimalist, significantly lower than the baseline model's FID score of 34.2, indicate that the generated samples are visually closer to real data. Additionally, the Perceptual Path Length (PPL) score of 120.4 (compared to 178.7 for the baseline model) reflects smoother and more diverse distributions in the latent space. t-SNE visualizations further validate the broad coverage and clear separation of generated samples across different styles.

Traditional performance appraisal methods often have problems such as single data dimension and subjective setting of appraisal indicators, making it difficult to effectively evaluate the synergy between finance and business. To this end, this paper proposes an intelligent performance evaluation method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) to improve the intelligence level of the appraisal system. The study uses conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to construct a performance evaluation framework, establishes a high-dimensional performance scoring model through the collaborative input of business data and financial data, and optimizes the rationality and accuracy of the scoring results under the adversarial training mechanism. Experiments show that compared with traditional linear regression models and decision tree models, the performance appraisal scoring error generated by GAN is reduced by 18.4\%, and the performance prediction accuracy is increased by 21.7\%. This method can effectively improve the scientific nature of enterprise performance appraisal, promote the in-depth development of business-finance integration, and provide theoretical support and practical guidance for enterprise intelligent management.},

Further, the study statistically assessed the impact of semantic similarity computations and network analysis techniques like PageRank on mapping information points to particular OBE objectives. Improved alignment between knowledge points and OBE objectives is demonstrated by experimental results that show a 6\% increase in semantic similarity and a 30\% decrease in mapping variance. In addition, utilizing the knowledge graph for teaching optimization resulted in a 7\% decrease in overall course satisfaction and a 15\% decrease in the core knowledge acquisition time.

 abstract = {This research aims at the problem of measurement data distortion in contact profilometers caused by factors such as probe contamination and scanning position deviation. An automatic annotation method based on signal processing and geometric correction is proposed. Signal denoising is achieved through Fourier transform. The derivative operation is combined to extract contour characteristic parameters, and the rotation matrix is used to correct the tilt error of the workpiece.Experiments show that, on the premise of retaining the original contour features,the annotation error of the notch width is less than 0.05 mm, and the calculation accuracy of the arc radius reaches 99.2\%. This significantly improves the automatic annotation efficiency of the contours of complex workpieces. The research results provide reliable technical support for high-precision measurement in the field of industrial inspection.},

 abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and the upgrading of industrial structure, the demand changes in the labor market show more complex dynamic characteristics, and it is difficult for traditional statistical and machine learning methods to accurately predict market trends. In order to improve the prediction accuracy and model adaptability, this paper proposes a labor demand prediction model based on generative adversarial deep learning (GADL) and multi-modal data fusion. The model uses generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate supplementary data to compensate for data scarcity, combined with convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer to conduct multimodal feature extraction, and finally time series modeling by long and short-term memory network (LSTM). The experimental results show that the GADL model is better than the LSTM and ARIMA method in several key performance indicators, and the mean square error (MSE) is reduced to 5\% of the traditional method, and the determination coefficient (R²) reaches 0.9966, which significantly improves the prediction accuracy. The research shows that GADL model can more effectively capture the changing trend of labor market and provide data support for the optimization of government employment policy, enterprise human resource planning and talent training in universities. The study in this paper provides a new methodology for labor market prediction and lays the foundation for subsequent research.},

 abstract = {With the rapid development of the digital economy, the efficiency, security and transparency of the platform have become increasingly important. Traditional platforms often encounter some problems when processing large amounts of user data, such as data insecurity, information asymmetry, and slow service response. To solve these problems, we proposed a new service model optimization method that combines cluster analysis with blockchain technology to improve the platform's operating efficiency and service quality. In the study, we used several common clustering algorithms, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering, to analyze user behavior data on digital platforms and find different user behavior patterns. At the same time, we also introduced blockchain technology to ensure that data can be stored and managed securely. Through its decentralized mechanism and smart contracts, we automated some processes and reduced manual operations. In the experimental phase, we collected 3,000 user behavior data from China's JD platform. Through cluster analysis, we divided users into several different groups based on their behavioral characteristics, and then combined blockchain technology to optimize the service processes of these user groups. The effect of this combination strategy is very obvious. The experimental results show that cluster analysis can effectively identify the differentiated needs of different user groups, and blockchain technology has brought significant improvements in data security, transparency and overall service efficiency. However, it should be said that the system will become a bit complicated after the introduction of blockchain.},

However, traditional SiPSAs are predominantly thermally cured solvent-based products, which not only exhibit slow curing rates but also release harmful solvents like toluene during application, causing environmental pollution. To address this issue, this study Under the background of artificial intelligence. synthesized thiol-functionalized MTQ silicone resins (MTQ-SH) with various M/(T+Q) ratios using γ-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, tetraethyl orthosilicate, and hexamethyldisiloxane as raw materials. These resins were then photo-crosslinked with vinyl-terminated silicone oil to prepare UV-curable silicone PSAs (UV-SiPSAs). The results revealed that the optimal precursor ratio for UV-SiPSA preparation was M/T/Q = 1.00/0.21/1.58. When the photoinitiator TPO-L was added at 1 wt.\% and the molar ratio of thiol groups to vinyl end groups was 1.2:1, the resulting UV-SiPSA exhibited an initial adhesion strength capable of holding a 22# steel ball and a holding time of 230 minutes at 25℃.

 abstract = {Generative AI tools have great potential for application in the field of education, but there are few studies on the behavioral patterns and influencing factors of students using these tools. This study explores the behavioral characteristics and text generation quality of college students when using generative AI tools, and proposes an integrated research framework that combines natural language processing (NLP), cluster analysis, and regression models. This study uses 200 students from a university in Guangdong as the research dataset, uses the BERT model to quantify the fluency, relevance, and creativity of generated texts, and uses the K-means algorithm to classify students' behaviors into three categories: high-frequency learners, low-frequency casual users, and mixed users. The experimental results show that the text quality under different task types is significantly different. For example, the scenarios of writing summary generation and creative writing are different. The summary generation task has the highest score in relevance (90 points), while the creative writing task performs well in creativity (85 points). Subsequent regression analysis found that professional background and technical attitude are key factors affecting behavioral patterns. Students of science and engineering tend to frequently use generative AI tools for complex tasks, while students of humanities pay more attention to language fluency and creativity.},

Driven by the “disruptive technology revolution” in different fields, AI is reshaping knowledge acquisition, teaching and learning, from personalized learning systems to the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the traditional “factory” mode of education is difficult to adapt to personalized learning development needs. Learning development needs, and artificial intelligence-driven systems in support of adaptive learning, intelligent tutoring and automatic assessment, in addition to greatly improve the learning efficiency “liberation of productivity”, but also to change the way of knowledge transfer, affect human cognition and independent learning. It is foreseeable that the competition for education in the age of artificial intelligence may shift from knowledge accumulation to computational power domination. That is to say, individuals with more computing power will have access to better learning resources, which will definitely increase the “digital education gap” on the other hand. This paper analyzes the current situation, challenges, and future trends of AI in education, and explores the impact of AI on self-directed learning, cognitive processes, and the possible evolution of education towards computational competitiveness. Using research methods such as literature review, case study, and technology trend prediction, this study combines the theories of cognitive science, philosophy of AI, and pedagogy to assess the educational impact of AI and propose policy recommendations to promote equity and optimize AI cooperation.},

This paper takes the course of “Java Framework Application “in software technology major as the research object, discusses how to empower the traditional teaching mode through AIGC technology, and improve the teaching quality and practical effect of the course. Firstly, the pain points existing in the current Java framework course teaching were analyzed, including the shortage of case resources, the single practice scene, and the lack of personalized guidance. Secondly, combined with the technical characteristics of AIGC, a multi-dimensional application model covering code generation, intelligent question answering, scene simulation and learning effect evaluation was constructed. By introducing a large language model to automatically generate customized case codes of mainstream frameworks such as Spring Boot and MyBatis, conversational AI is used to assist students to solve development problems in real time, and a virtual project scene is constructed based on generative technology to strengthen engineering practice ability. Teaching practice shows that the application of AIGC technology greatly improves students 'code standardization and project development efficiency, and teachers can accurately locate learning weaknesses through intelligent analysis tools. This study provides a reusable implementation path for the intelligent transformation of technology courses, and verifies the empowering value of generative artificial intelligence in the field of vocational education, which has important reference significance for the optimization of future curriculum system.},

 abstract = {This article analyses the current research status of artificial intelligence in the field of ceramic art at home and abroad, as well as the problems and reasons of traditional ceramic art, and thoroughly studies the techniques of Chinese fine brushwork flower and bird painting, and innovatively integrates it into the creation of underglaze colourful ceramic works. At the same time, artificial intelligence technology was introduced, focusing on how to use artificial intelligence to help traditional ceramic art creation to improve its artistic expression and production efficiency. This paper uses convolutional neural network (CNN) as the infrastructure of the aesthetic evaluation model of underglaze colored ceramic art; selects several underglaze colored ceramic art design schemes generated based on generative adversarial network (GAN) to show their innovative design in modeling, decoration and color; color prediction and design scheme classification and sorting by support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) machine learning algorithms. Combining the functions of artificial intelligence such as image recognition, data analysis and generation, and design, we actively explore the path of innovative development of traditional ceramic art in the context of the new era, and strive to achieve the deep integration of traditional craftsmanship and modern technology, thereby injecting new vitality into the inheritance and development of ceramic art and promoting it to a new stage of development.},

 abstract = {The emergence of generative AI has become a hot topic in academia and industry. Generative AI is also gradually becoming an interaction mode between enterprises and customers, improving customer experience and influencing their continued use intention. However, there is still uncertainty as to whether users are willing to use generative AI-driven products and services for a long time. Previous studies have mostly been based on traditional industries. How to enhance users’ continued use intention from the perspective of AI has become a widely concerned issue in academia and industry.Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Expectation Confirmation Theory (ECT), this study explores the impact of generative AI features on users’ continued use intention by improving the two paths of user perceived value and user satisfaction. 306 valid questionnaires were used, and SPSS 27.0 and SEM were used for data analysis and hypothesis testing. The results show that (1) generative AI features have a significant positive impact on users’ continued use intention; (2) user perceived value and user satisfaction play a mediating role in the relationship between generative AI features and users’ continued use intention. This finding improves users’ continued use intention of generative AI features, which is of great significance for understanding the marketing layout of generative AI for enterprises.},

 abstract = {This paper takes the group standards of China's artificial intelligence-related industries as the research object and analyzes the characteristics of participating drafting units and group standard organizations in the group standard cooperation network based on the structural characteristics such as centrality and network density obtained from social network analysis. The study finds that although the development time of group standards in China's artificial intelligence-related industries is short, the development is rapid, and the cooperation network has basically taken shape. The central positions of some group standard organizations and participating drafting units have been initially formed. However, it can also be seen that some group standard organizations, despite having a close relationship with participating drafting units, have not yet established connections with the overall network, indicating that the overall cooperation network is still loose, and only some group standard organizations play relatively key roles in constructing the network for the formulation of group standards in the artificial intelligence-related industries. In the process of promoting the maturity of the cooperation network of group standards in artificial intelligence-related industries, there are still many challenges and room for optimization. On the one hand, it is urgent to take effective measures to strengthen the connections among all entities within the network, reduce the looseness of the network, and improve the overall collaborative efficiency, such as establishing an information sharing platform. On the other hand, group standard organizations and participating drafting units in central positions should give full play to their leading and exemplary roles, and drive the common development of other entities within the network through means such as technical assistance and experience sharing. In addition, the government and industry associations should also play an active role by introducing targeted policies and regulations to guide the formulation and implementation of group standards for artificial intelligence, urging all parties involved to strengthen cooperation and build a more complete standard system. Looking ahead, with the continuous deepening of collaborative governance by all parties, the cooperation network of group standards in the artificial intelligence industry will continue to be optimized and upgraded. It will not only promote the high-quality development of China's artificial intelligence industry but also demonstrate China's wisdom in the field of global artificial intelligence standard setting and enhance China's international discourse power and influence in this field.},

In this paper, we construct the ‘AIGC-DRIVE’ dynamic closed-loop model to explain the role of AIGC in the innovation of platform economy content production and marketing strategy, and carry out efficiency comparison, AB test of AIGC advertisement strategy, and research on users' privacy concerns, as well as combining with the typical case studies of Jitterbug and SHEIN. It is found that AIGC can greatly improve the production efficiency and support the real-time optimisation of dynamic marketing strategies through data-driven multimodal content generation; however, the application of the technology faces the risks of content homogenisation, algorithmic black-boxing and user privacy leakage. This paper proposes a synergistic mechanism of ‘technology embedding - institutional constraints - user feedback’ to achieve sustainable development, which provides a theoretical basis and a practical path for the design of the governance framework of AIGC in the platform economy.},

 abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to simulate rare disease situations. This is a potential way to train robotic systems, especially for medical actions. It can be hard to get real-world data for training because trends in rare diseases are often complicated, varied, and hard to predict. This can make it time-consuming, expensive, and morally problematic. Generative AI models, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variation Autoencoders (VAEs), can make fake but real medical situations that show how complicated rare diseases are. It is easy to make different datasets with these AI-driven models. These datasets can then be used to train robots so they can do complicated medical treatments more accurately and quickly By adding these AI models to artificial training environments, it is possible to create many rare disease cases that would be hard to make in regular training settings. The models improve robots' abilities to make smart choices, deal with new problems, and guess how patients will do in real time by exposing them to a lot of different situations. Using generative AI also cuts down on the need for real patient data, which protects privacy while still providing the reality needed for effective training. This method not only makes medical robots better at their jobs and more flexible in situations involving rare diseases, but it also makes it easier for them to keep learning. The robots can get better at making decisions by going through virtual situations that get more complicated. In the end, this study looks at how generative AI could be used to make computer systems that are smarter and can react to rare diseases. This would make medical treatments in these specialized fields more accurate and safer.},

Rather than treating such misalignments as failures to be corrected, this paper reframes them as sources of creative ambiguity and cognitive tension. Drawing on theories of cognitive dissonance, frame conflict, and prediction error, I show how these tensions can catalyze reflection, reinterpretation, and creative reframing. Through five cross-modal cases spanning writing, design, music, code, and prototyping I demonstrate how creative ambiguity and cognitive tension function as generative forces in human–AI interaction.

 abstract = {With ‘Generative Artificial Intelligence’ (GenAI), a new momentum has swept public opinion and, as with the Times front page on 27 February 2023, which describes an ‘arms race’ among major companies. While the GenAI in the workplace is new, the few studies suggest several benefits of such systems in work contexts. However, these results focus on the quantitative indicators, and further literature on the implementation of generative AI systems at work is still scarce. In this context, it is important to specify how to integrate a GenAI-based tool into an existing socio-technical organisation, as such integration always deeply transforms the employees’ activity. In this paper, we discuss the human-centred design of GenAI-based tools on the basis of an ergonomics intervention for the Ombudsman's team of an energy utility company. We explore how a participatory design approach – grounded in the preliminary analysis of the work – can help inform the development of a GenAI-based tool. We discuss the relevance of this methodology and the intermediary role of the ergonomists, given the dual challenge that end-users often lack a comprehensive understanding of GenAI's possibilities and potential applications, while data-scientists responsible for developing such tools are not trained to analyse complex work activities, which is a necessary step for selecting and training the appropriate AI models.},

Since the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), researchers have used specialized models to improve or automatize scientific processes and even scientific discoveries. In our study, we investigate whether proprietary large language models such as ChatGPT, though not specifically trained for scientific work, are able to convincingly perform or even surpass human scientific creativity. We asked graduate students and prompted ChatGPT to write an abbreviated version of a research proposal for a fictious scenario from the field of computer science/ robotics. Four specific assignments were given (i.e., formulating a hypothesis, designing an experiment, listing the required equipment, and justifying the chosen method). Human and AI-generated answers were rated by two scientists from the field, following a peer-review approach. Our results indicate that ChatGPT reached significantly higher overall scores relative to the human sample. However, closer inspection of the data and the rating procedure revealed that the evaluation of performance especially in regards to the originality of ideas differed considerably between the two raters. We evaluate these findings in more detail, as well as qualitative differences between human and AI- generated responses. Lastly, we discuss the impact of raters’ knowledge about and attitudes towards Generative AI and emphasize the importance of meta-cognitive skills to identify Generative AI.},

This paper proposes a different view: prompts function as cognitive interfaces that mediate between user intent and algorithmic generation. Integrating theories of external cognition, interface semiotics, and pragmatist theories of situated inquiry, the paper provides a theoretical framing of prompting along three interrelated dimensions: semantic projection, compositional structuring, and interpretive negotiation. Through an empirical vignette from branding communication, I show how prompting can be seen as a dynamic representational activity, deeply embedded in cognitive processes of exploration, articulation, and iterative refinement. By reframing the prompt as a site of cognitive labor rather than as a static interface, this expands our understanding of interaction with generative AI as epistemic, semiotic, and situated.},

 abstract = {Traditional theory-practice integrated teaching models in secondary vocational education encounter various challenges. Theoretical content often appears overly abstract, and teacher-student interaction tends to be one-side,practical resources are usually scattered, and teaching evaluations frequently fall behind. To address these issues, this study proposes a teaching model driven by intelligent-digital integration, aiming to unify theory and practice effectively. The integration of AR/VR interactive learning systems, modular digital training systems, and intelligent classroom analytics systems constructs a closed-loop teaching framework. This framework follows the sequence of theory, practice, and evaluation. A case study on the course Microcontroller Application Technology verifies the effectiveness of this implementation. Findings indicate that the proposed model significantly improves learning outcomes. It also raises the frequency of classroom interaction and enhances the efficiency of completing practical tasks. The model gathers data in real time and evaluates it from multiple dimensions. This optimizes the teaching process across its entire cycle. It provides technical methods and practical models. These can be replicated for the digital transformation of vocational education.},

 abstract = {The utilization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek is bringing about significant changes in educational practices and learning environments. This alteration underlines the necessity to look into how AI can enhance ethics education for the youth. This research reveals that the capabilities of GAI match up well with the requirements of youth ethics education in four principal ways: (1) crafting immersive, multi-sensory scenarios to boost student interest. By creating such scenarios, students can get more engaged and excited about learning. (2) Employing adaptive methods for precise interventions. This means being able to adjust the teaching approach according to each student's specific situation to make the intervention more effective. (3) Generating personalized content to customize the delivery of knowledge. Every student is different, and personalized content can better meet their individual learning needs. (4) Offering real-time analysis to improve teaching methods. With real-time analysis, teachers can quickly understand how students are doing and make timely adjustments. Based on these connections, this study puts forward a framework that incorporates GAI into crucial parts of the teaching process: integrating comprehensive learning data. This helps to have a more complete understanding of students' learning progress. Developing evidence-based strategies. So that teaching decisions are made with solid evidence. Creating differentiated content. To cater to the diverse needs of students. And assessing outcomes in multiple dimensions. This integration not only enhances the efficiency of moral education but also provides a scalable model for applying AI-driven teaching innovations across different subjects.},

However, sentiment information of financial texts requires a lot of domain expert knowledge, and manual retrieval is expensive. In this paper, we propose the application of an evolutionary generative model for sentiment retrieval of financial information based on interactive genetic algorithms from the perspective of user implicit modeling. The uncertain preference estimation of evolutionary individuals is realized. The user preference model is adjusted according to the uncertainty evaluation, and the user preference is dynamically tracked to obtain the fitness value of the evolutionary individual for evolutionary optimization. The experimental results show that the proposed method can implicitly perceive user preferences, reduce user explicit evaluation, reduce user fatigue, and improve the search performance of the algorithm.},

Under such a background, translation quality evaluation system relying on deep learning has gradually become a hot research topic in the field of translation research. Traditional manual evaluation methods have their own shortcomings, which are relatively subjective and low evaluation efficiency. The existing automatic assessment indicators such as BLEU and METEOR, which have deficiencies in cultural adaptability and logical coherence, cannot meet the complex needs of Sino-French alternating interpretation. This evaluation system combines multi-modal analysis with cross-language and cultural feature database. Based on the improvement of Transformer model architecture, a hierarchical evaluation mechanism is designed, which significantly improves the objectivity of evaluation and makes the evaluation more comprehensive. The experimental results show that this system has more advantages than the traditional method in the three core indicators of accuracy, fluency and cultural adaptability. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the score of this system and the human score reaches 0.87, which proves that it is effective in cross-language and cultural adaptation scenarios. This study provides an extensible technical framework for the assessment of translation quality, and provides innovative solutions to the challenges of linguistic structural differences and cultural metaphor translation.},

To clarify the influence mechanism of AI on corporate strategic decision-making, to elucidate the mechanisms through which AI influences corporate strategic decision-making, this study uses Chinese A-share listed companies from 2013 to 2023 as a sample to empirically examine the impact of AI on strategic decision-making. The research finds that AI application significantly increases the overall strategic deviance of enterprises, supporting the "differentiation effect" hypothesis. Sub-dimensional tests show that AI drives enterprises to significantly deviate from industry norms in advertising investment, R&amp;D intensity, and fixed asset renewal, demonstrating characteristics of "active innovation"; while in the dimensions of capital intensity and financial leverage, enterprises tend to approach industry averages, reflecting a "rational contraction" tendency.

To systematically investigate the synergistic effects arising from the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with construction practices, this study categorizes AI applications into three phases: design, construction, and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M). In the design phase, Building Information Modeling (BIM) and generative AI are synergistically employed to optimize architectural solutions. During the construction phase, intelligent construction robots, 5G-enabled tower cranes and other automated equipments are integrated with BIM and Augmented Reality (AR) platforms. This combination increases managerial and operational efficiency. For the O&amp;M phase, a digital twin platform supported by Internet of Things (IoT) networks and AI-driven predictive analytics enables preventive equipment maintenance and energy consumption optimization. Taking Xiong'an New Area as a representative case study, this research demonstrates that the symbiotic integration of AI technologies with construction substantial improvements across project lifecycles, operational efficiency, and safety performance.

 abstract = {This paper investigates the bias effect in the application of artificial intelligence in China and its impact on the employment structure of the labor force. Using statistical analysis and modeling methods, the study analyzes the relevant data of China's labor market from 2013 to 2023.The study first defines the elasticity of substitution, the technology bias index and the labor allocation bias index and, on this basis, builds a model to calculate the three indices.The calculation results show that from 2013 to 2023, the factor allocation bias effect in China's labor market favors low-end labor; the technology bias effect between low-end and mid-end labor favors mid-end labor; and the bias effect between low-end and mid-end labor inhibits the employment of low-end labor. The initial phenomenon of polarization began to appear in China's labor market.Next, the study conducted a correlation analysis and found that the size of AI applications is negatively correlated with the employment of the low-end and mid-end labor force and positively correlated with the employment of the high-end labor force. This implies that the expansion of AI applications in China has helped to promote the employment of the high-end labor force, but has been detrimental to the employment of the mid- and low-end labor force, especially the mid-end labor force.Finally, based on the findings of the study, the following countermeasures are proposed: deepen the degree of human-machine synergy, realize two-way empowerment of human-machine; improve the quality of higher education, strengthen the training of employment skills, improve the mechanism of employment security, and improve the social security system.},

A user can how engage in a fluent conversation in ordinary language with a computer. Suddenly many people want to know what AI is, whether it is safe, and what benefits it might bring. Artificial intelligence is defined to be a collection of machines and algorithms that perform tasks normally considered to require human cognition. Opinions and claims about the possible benefits and risks of AI are all over the map. In response to the confusion, the Ubiquity editors are launching a symposium on AI. It will be a series of about two dozen articles on the many aspects of AI and its applications. The series will be synthesized into the "Ubiquity Report on Artificial Intelligence," which is intended to be an authoritative and trustworthy summary of present and future AI.},

 abstract = {More than the 70 years since its emergence in the early 1950s, artificial intelligence (AI) is performing cognitive tasks traditionally considered the unique province of humans. This progress did not occur in a vacuum. AI emerged against a rich background of technologies from computer science and ideas about intelligence and learning from philosophy, psychology, logic, game theory, and cognitive science. We sketch out the enabling technologies for AI. They include search, reasoning, neural networks, natural language processing, signal processing and computer graphics, programming and conventional software engineering, human-computer interaction, communications, and specialized hardware that provides supercomputing power. Beyond these technologies is the notion of Artificial General Intelligence that has or exceeds the capabilities of the human brain. Currently this is completely aspirational and is not expected to be possible before 2025, if ever. Artificial Intelligence is based on a variety of technologies, none of which seek to emulate human intelligence.},

 abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are the first neural network machines capable of carrying on conversations with humans. They are trained on billions of words of text scraped from the internet. They generate text responses to text inputs. They have transformed the public awareness of artificial intelligence, bringing on reactions ranging from astonishment and awe to trepidation and horror. They have spurred massive investments in new tools for drafting texts, summarizing conversations, summarizing literature, generating images, coding simple programs, supporting education, and amusing humans. Experience with them has shown them likely to respond with fabrications (called "hallucinations") that severely undermine their trustworthiness and make them unsafe for critical applications. Here, we will examine the limitations of LLMs imposed by their design and function. These are not bugs but are inherent limitations of the technology. The same limitations make it unlikely that LLM machines will ever be capable of performing all human tasks at the skill levels of humans.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, the global digital transformation of healthcare is advancing rapidly with the help of technologies such as electronic medical records, telemedicine, and mobile medical applications. However, there are still challenges in EMR interoperability, security, and data exchange. To address these existing limitations, This study proposes a voice electronic medical record system driven by artificial intelligence and blockchain, which is designed to improve clinical records and nursing coordination. This system adopts a dedicated deep learning architecture. It transcribe the conversations between doctors and patients into text, and then uses natural language processing to extract the relevant medical information. At the same time, it also provides diagnostic prompts, which can reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Doctors can view and edit these summaries generated by artificial intelligence. Then safely record them on the decentralized crypto blockchain ledger. With federated learning, the model can be continuously improved in multiple centers without infringing on data privacy. This solution integrates automatic speech recognition, distributed ledger technology, and collaborative deep learning, aiming to enhance the EMR efficiency, security, data integrity, and care continuity of medical institutions. The combination of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence technology holds great potential. It can transform fragmented health data into portable and interoperable records under patient control, thus bringing strategic advantages to the health system that is undergoing a comprehensive digital transformation.},

This submission presents a systematic review of 95 case studies, 64 in education, 14 in arts, and 17 in heritage — selected via a PRISMA-guided search and expert screening — to map how generative artificial intelligence is embedded at both the interface and interaction levels. We identify nine interface archetypes (e.g., conversational, adaptive dashboards, immersive environments interfaces), eight interaction patterns (e.g., conversing, collaborating, manipulating),and eight main user experience dimensions as observed in case studies. Our analysis further categorizes six modality-usage patterns—from text, image, audio, and video up to fully multi-modal workflows and distillsfour main categories of end-to-end application pipelines. Notably, only two studies were found to articulate design-phase guidelines, and limitations cluster around output quality, ethical risks, and a lack of longitudinal evaluations. We conclude with limitations observed and future research focused on explainability, participatory design, and sustained field deployments. This synthesis provides a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness generative artificial intelligence as a responsive, human-centered collaborator.},

Use the Python language to crawl words related to "supply chain risk" in corporate annual reports, which are used to calculate the supply chain risk of enterprises. The fixed effects model and the intermediary effect model are used to empirically test the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in mitigating the supply chain risk. Through empirical research, we find that: AI plays an instrumental role in mitigating corporate supply chain risk. AI mitigates the supply chain risk by improving resource allocation efficiency of enterprises. The heterogeneity analysis shows that for enterprises in highly competitive industries, the mitigating effect of AI on the supply chain risk is more evident; in non-technology-oriented enterprises, the mitigating effect of artificial intelligence on supply chain risk is more significant.

However, deploying conversational agents is challenging and can easily have adverse effects. To this end, more conceptual clarity on how to design for, for example, trust, in conversational agents is needed. Ideally, using theories could provide conceptual clarity and guide and ground conversational agents designed for trust. We conducted a scoping review on how systematically trust is being designed for in conversational agents. The review shows that although the conversational agent work is well grounded, the variation in referential theories used, manipulations chosen, and measures used is high. Moreover, the relation between these dimensions is not always explicitly explained. This hinders the abstraction of more generalizable research findings. We conclude with the suggestion for the development of more intermediate levels of knowledge in the context of designing for trust in conversational agents.},

 abstract = {As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) becomes an increasingly significant part of young people’s lives, educators worry about its impact on learning and attainment. However, understanding this impact requires more than simply studying young people’s behaviours or soliciting their opinions. It is essential to involve them actively as co-researchers, allowing their unique perspectives to shape the conversation around GenAI in schools. This project moves beyond seeing young people as research subjects, positioning them instead as co-designers, co-researchers, and potential influencers of national policy on GenAI in education. We recruited eight young people (aged 16–18) from three Scottish high schools to serve as Young People Co-Researchers (YPCR). Together, we explored their perspectives on GenAI at school, including their current usage, views on appropriate tasks for AI, and opinions on teachers’ use of AI. The YPCR organised and conducted semi-structured focus groups with 50 peers and collaboratively analysed the findings with adult researchers. Our results show that young people are cautiously optimistic about GenAI’s potential for learning and do not support outright bans in schools. They clearly distinguish between AI use for learning and in assessments, often expressing confusion over current policies and wishing for clearer guidance. The YPCR stated a strong desire to deepen their understanding of AI’s advantages and risks and for schools to teach responsible, effective use. Their insights are valuable for national policy development and for AI literacy initiatives.},

AI is developing fast, with a large number of applications shown, such as polishing the statement. The rapid development of AI has allowed its integration into various sectors, including 3D printing. While the applications of AI in many industrial systems have been identified by existing studies, the applications of this emerging technology in another promising technology – 3D printing – have been largely unexplored. This points out the necessity of conducting researches on this issue to facilitate the further development of both AI and 3D printing technologies. This study examines the application of AI across different phases of 3D printing, such as design, usage, production, and maintenance. AI enhances the efficiency of 3D printing by providing generative design alternatives, automating parameter settings, optimizing process controls, and improving product quality through real-time monitoring. AI's ability to store and analyze vast amounts of data enables better decision-making, predictive maintenance, and customized production, reducing costs and enhancing production capabilities. However, AI implementation in 3D printing also faces challenges, including system complexity, data privacy concerns, and the need for extensive sensor networks. As AI technologies continue to evolve, they promise further advancements in flexibility, precision, and cost-efficiency, potentially revolutionizing the 3D printing industry.

 abstract = {The new energy automobile industry faces the challenges of low manufacturing efficiency, high energy consumption and lack of flexibility. In this study, we propose the technical framework of “3D sensing + digital twin + edge computing”, which achieves 0.1mm inspection accuracy of highly reflective metal parts through the fusion of laser scanning and structured light imaging, and the defect leakage rate is reduced from 8\% to 0.5\%; reinforcement learning dynamically optimizes the energy consumption of coating process, and reduces the energy consumption of a single battery cell by 24\%; spatiotemporal map convolutional network (STGCN) compresses the switching time of a vehicle to 18 minutes. Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) compresses model switching time to 18 minutes. Empirical studies show that Geely Xiangtan Base has reduced annual costs by 21 million RMB after applying the framework, which meets the carbon footprint traceability requirements of the European Union and pushes the industry towards the goal of “zero defects, zero carbon emissions and zero delays”.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced sensor technologies have developed into maintenance, reliability, and optimized aircraft emergency hatch ejection drive mechanisms. The review study narrates research on AI-driven approaches: machine learning, deep learning, federated learning, and generative algorithms (GAs) for fault diagnosis. Internet of Things (IoT) enabled real-time monitoring and intelligence maintenance techniques. Recurrent neural networks particularly long short-term memory (LSTM) models and ML techniques analyse the sensor data for prediction of stress, wear, and failure modes of components, achieving high accuracy and enabling proactive interventions. The results reveal that IoT networks coupled with AI approaches continuously monitor critical parameters including vibration and temperature. This study reveals that optimization techniques, genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization play significant roles in enhancing the structural design of components like gears and connecting rods that achieve weight reductions without compromising safety. This study identifies challenges of model interpretability, data scarcity, and regulatory compliance. These issues are addressed by proposing hybrid AI models and federated learning. Emerging trends include self-healing materials, quantum ML approaches, and automated maintenance systems, which could transform safety in the aviation industry. By bridging research gaps between engineering practices and data-driven insights, this study shows that AI can play a vital role in advancing the efficiency and reliability of drive mechanisms in next-generation aircraft, compliance with aviation protocols, and paving the way for adaptive and autonomous systems.},

There are main difficulties include the multidenoting and the obscurity of words, the rate new jargon, the confusion difference of industry and in language-culture difficulties, particularly language not English.For these challenges, the paper suggests ways: to establish authoritative terminology databases (i.e., ISO/TC 37) that regularly updates their definitions and use for latest version; to intensify collaborations of global and national standard bodies to create one single norm, develop one single standard to define their terminologies usage, to design for the rules of translation to reflect consistent terminologies use, and professionals’ terminology literacy in using terms. Three cases from authors show how those approaches help cross-industry and cross-cultural communications, including use of digital twin to advance the development of aircrafts, automotive, and automobile production in detail.Our research attempt combining linguistics, artificial intelligence, and manufacturing engineering in the presentation of not only theoretical foundations but also practical references for assisting effective international cooperation and normalized development of AI and smart manufacturing.

 abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, its application in the field of language culture and visual presentation has attracted widespread attention. As an important part of China's regional culture, the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing have unique phonetic, lexical and grammatical characteristics. However, with the advancement of modernization, the inheritance and revitalization of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing face many challenges. This paper takes the visual transformation of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing as the research object, and explores how to integrate artificial intelligence technology into the workshop design strategy with the visual transformation of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing as the research object, so as to achieve the symbolic translation and multi-dimensional visualization presentation of the dialects. The study first extracted the representative vocabulary of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing and analyzed their visual transformation needs. Combining the advantages of artificial intelligence technology, the action research method was used to establish a workshop based on a multimodal transformation framework such as speech recognition and image generation. Through case analysis and practical verification, this paper demonstrates the application effect of artificial intelligence technology in the dialect visual transformation workshop, including the visualization of dialect words, the visualization of dialect stories, and the interactive experience of dialect culture. The research conclusion is: the icons generated by generative artificial intelligence integrated into the visual transformation of dialects can be seen to have more concrete symbols and fewer symbolic symbols. These will gradually change as the participants are "tamed" by artificial intelligence. In the graphic symbols generated by combining symbols, we can find two types of combination: international symbols and regional symbols. This provides an experimental paradigm for the design with dialect as the carrier, and also provides a reference for the discussion of the spread and regeneration of dialect.},

Technological innovations include a hybrid architecture combining a bi-directional GRU network with a context-aware attention layer optimised to detect subtle awareness gaps in open academic discourse.As higher education struggles to respond to the needs of a mass and diverse learner population, this research highlights how AI's dual role as an analytical tool and instructional partner transforms classrooms into responsive ecosystems where every conversation shapes tomorrow's learning trajectory.},

 abstract = {Paradigm-breaking innovations in generative artificial intelligence (GAI) are revolutionizing the landscape of postgraduate education at an unprecedented rate.This work chooses a Chinese university's "Customer Relationship Management" course as a case and explores both channels and empirical implications of GAI-driven curriculum innovation. This study presents a 'Three-Tier Three-Driver' personalized teaching reform model that categorizes students into three tiers based on different career trajectories and leverages AI as a driver across three dimensions: teaching content, teaching methods, and assessment.Multiple AI tools and methods like AI teaching assistants, GPT models, knowledge graph construction, Q&amp;A modules, and AI assessment modules are used by the course to design the entire curriculum anew, boost pedagogical practice, and reconstruct assessment schemes.Data were collected from a questionnaire survey with 500 students and were modeled using K-Means clustering, DBSCAN density-based clustering algorithms and random forest models. Results demonstrate significant differences in student behaviors and perceptions related to AI tool usage across the different clusters.Effective use of AI technologies was found to benefit student satisfaction and academic performance. Furthermore, there was a significant association found between AI use times and course satisfaction, however DBSCAN could not detect a group of extreme learners.The study concludes by compiling replicable evidence of AI-driven teaching innovation and discussing existing limitations (such as the limited sample scope) as well as possible directions for future work.The conclusion uncovers GAI-empowered teaching innovation as a good promise for teaching quality improvement and personalized learning promotion for postgraduate education.},

 abstract = {With the growing research and practical application of digital-intelligence technologies such as Artificial Intelligence Generated Content(AIGC) in core design courses, the impact of AIGC on students' higher-order thinking skills(HOTS) in the teaching of core design courses via blended learning is becoming more and more evident. In this study, we applied AIGC in the teaching practice related to higher-order thinking, and conducted both qualitative and quantitative analyses on the field verification and review depth of 240 students through investigations. The results show that AIGC can effectively enhance students' HOTS. Specifically, males show a greater preference for field verification, while females demonstrate a higher level of review depth. However, it is also found that over-reliance on AIGC may weaken HOTS. These results offer practical and theoretical support for teaching according to students' aptitude and effectively promote the deep integration and reform of artificial intelligence with design teaching. These results offer practical and theoretical support for teaching according to students' aptitude, maximizing the interaction effectiveness of a Human-Machine Cooperative blended teaching model and effectively promoting the deep integration and reform of artificial intelligence with design teaching.},

 abstract = {This study explores the systematic integration of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in university English language teaching, focusing on the core challenge of optimising the teaching closure loop. Using a mixed research method (questionnaire survey, classroom experiment and content analysis), AIGC was found to have significant efficacy in multimodal resource generation, personalised feedback and intercultural scene simulation. The study proposes a three-dimensional collaborative teaching framework: teacher-AIGC-learners, which reveals that the core value of AIGC is to liberate teachers from mechanical labour and achieve precise teaching interventions. Meanwhile, the study faces the ethical dilemmas of academic integrity and data privacy, and proposes a governance framework that combines technological constraints, institutional norms, and humanistic education. The experimental data show that AIGC assistance increases students' writing complexity by 27.9\% and decreases their speaking anxiety index by 34\%, but there are also problems such as weakened critical thinking due to technological dependence. This study provides a reusable pedagogical model and risk coping strategy for the digital transformation of education.},

To exceed the limitations of traditional teaching scaffolds that lacked customization, they developed a dynamic scaffold framework based on metacognitive theory and generative artificial intelligence technology. Its structure is mainly composed of behavioral examination research, creative dialogue exchanges, and responses to self-awareness. On the Coze platform, users can build an intelligent agent, select a "three-person voting setup" and a "four-person quiz setup" scenario, and then conduct educational exercises. The results showed that this structure enabled learners to perform superior in goal setting, strategy application, and reflective standard, which shows that self-awareness assistance using general artificial intelligence is indeed very promising in helping people to gain deeper understanding.},

This review paper combines current developments in AI technology with recurrent neural networks (RNN) to study psychological aspects that impact tennis training strategy development. Study examined six studies from 2022 to 2024 by following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for systematic assessment. The selected findings assess AI-controlled psychological regulation alongside error action recognition and introduce improvements for online teaching and electronic line judging and automated ball transmitter path analysis and ball-passing net tracking systems. The research demonstrates that implementing RNNs optimized through AI systems produces better psychological state predictions that achieve 73\% successful intervention outcomes. Big data analytics improve online tennis education while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate 95.34\% success in error action recognition. The controversy about AI taking over human line judges persists because it raises technical advantages but also ethical considerations.

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have infiltrated most aspects of our lives and the technologies we use, including social media. Content (and moderation thereof) on many popular social media platforms is currently a mix of human- and AI-generated. Depending on many technical, situational, and contextual factors, both human- and AI-generated content on social media platforms have the potential to either fuel or fight the stigmatization of marginalized groups. Stigmatization is the social process of stereotyping, devaluing, or marginalizing individuals or groups based on certain characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, religion, or race, which can lead to social exclusion and psychological damage. The impact of AI agents on either reinforcing or reducing existing stigmatization on social media platforms remains largely unknown within our scholarly community. We have even less understanding of how to design and implement AI agents that can actively help transform social media platforms into spaces for combating stigmatization while empowering marginalized groups. In this editorial, we call on the information systems (IS) community to conduct empirical, design, and theoretical research at the intersection of social media, specific AI systems or agents, and marginalized contexts. Advancing research in this space is critical to understanding and shaping the future of social media platforms as a social good and as places to reduce stigmatization.},

Specifically, based on findings in Phases 1 and 2, we developed AskArt, an interactive interface that combines DALL-E and GPT and is tailored to support elementary school students in their art projects, and deployed it in Phases 3 and 4. Our findings revealed the benefits of GenAI in providing background information, inspirations, and personalized guidance. However, challenges in query formulation for generating expected content were also observed. Moreover, students employed varied collaboration strategies, and teachers noted increased engagement alongside concerns regarding misuse and interface suitability.

Prior work established the potential for these tools to enhance personal creativity and productivity towards shared goals; however, we don't know yet how to best take into account the nuances of group work and team dynamics when deploying GenAI in work settings. In this paper, we investigate the potential of collaborative GenAI agents to augment teamwork in synchronous group settings through an exploratory study that engaged 25 professionals across 6 teams in speculative design workshops and individual follow-up interviews. Our workshops included a mixed reality provotype to simulate embodied collaborative GenAI agents capable of actively participating in group discussions. Our findings suggest that, if designed well, collaborative GenAI agents offer valuable opportunities to enhance team problem-solving by challenging groupthink, bridging communication gaps, and reducing social friction. However, teams' willingness to integrate GenAI agents depended on its perceived fit across a number of individual, team, and organizational factors. We outline the key design tensions around agent representation, social prominence, and engagement and highlight the opportunities spatial and immersive technologies could offer to modulate GenAI influence on team outcomes and strike a balance between augmentation and agency.},

With AI/ML technologies being increasingly integrated into young people's lives, there is an urgent need to equip teenagers with AI literacies that build both technical knowledge and awareness of social impacts. Algorithm audits (also called AI audits) have traditionally been employed by experts to assess potential harmful biases, but recent research suggests that non-expert users can also participate productively in auditing. We conducted a two-week participatory design workshop with 14 teenagers (ages 14-15), where they audited the generative AI model behind TikTok's Effect House, a tool for creating interactive TikTok filters. We present a case study describing how teenagers approached the audit, from deciding what to audit to analyzing data using diverse strategies and communicating their results. Our findings show that participants were engaged and creative throughout the activities, independently raising and exploring new considerations, such as age-related biases, that are uncommon in professional audits. We drew on our expertise in algorithm auditing to triangulate their findings as a way to examine if the workshop supported participants to reach coherent conclusions in their audit. Although the resulting number of changes in race, gender, and age representation uncovered by the teens were slightly different from ours, we reached similar conclusions. This study highlights the potential for auditing to inspire learning activities to foster AI literacies, empower teenagers to critically examine AI systems, and contribute fresh perspectives to the study of algorithmic harms.},

 abstract = {As a unique folk art form in Southwest China, Qijiang New Year pictures are facing the dual challenges of static communication limitation and insufficient technical adaptation in the digital transformation. Based on the technology of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AIGC), by constructing a multi-objective loss function that integrates the semantic alignment of text, color constraint and style feature preservation mechanism, the key problems such as color deviation and motion mutation in the dynamic process of traditional woodcut are solved. Combining optical flow-oriented interpolation algorithm and physical simulation post-processing technology, the optimization of time sequence consistency and the accurate expression of cultural symbols are realized. Through the double evaluation system of quantitative indicators and user cognitive experiments, the advantages of the algorithm in sports fluency, style fidelity and narrative consistency are verified. This technology can be applied to cultural heritage communication, educational tourism and video game industry, and its cross-domain application potential needs to be reconstructed by activating young people's immersive experience.},

 abstract = {In the face of the high requirements of vocational education for practical skills training, as well as the poor results and high costs of traditional training, this study aims to build an efficient and intelligent virtual training and simulation operation platform by introducing generative artificial intelligence technology to improve teaching quality and learning efficiency. This paper uses the adversarial generation ability of GAN and combines it with the knowledge graph in the field of vocational education to generate a high-fidelity and scalable virtual training environment. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to dynamically adjust the scene parameters to adapt to the needs of different majors and skill levels. Based on the Transformer multimodal dialogue model, a real-time operation guidance system integrating virtual and real is constructed. The physical engine is combined to simulate the feedback of equipment operation, and the long short-term memory network (LSTM) is used to capture the characteristics of the trainee's operation sequence, dynamically predict potential errors and trigger correction prompts. This paper also uses the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to build a personalized evaluation agent, using the trainee's operation data as the state space to generate targeted training suggestions. The average operation accuracy of the experimental group students reaches 89.715\%, the highest skill assessment pass rate reaches 100\%, and the overall distribution is more concentrated, reducing the cost of practical training. In addition, teachers and students highly evaluated the teaching adaptability, operation guidance and error correction functions of the platform. The teaching platform proposed in this study provides a new path and strategy for the modernization of vocational education.},

 abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have revolutionized intelligent systems by enabling machines to produce human-like content across diverse domains. However, their outputs often exhibit unpredictability due to complex and opaque internal semantic states, posing challenges for reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce the AI Uncertainty Principle, a novel theoretical framework inspired by quantum mechanics, to model and quantify the inherent unpredictability in generative AI outputs. By drawing parallels with the uncertainty principle and superposition, we formalize the trade-off between the precision of internal semantic states and output variability. Through comprehensive experiments involving state-of-the-art models and a variety of prompt designs, we analyze how factors such as specificity, complexity, tone, and style influence model behavior. Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts can significantly enhance output predictability and consistency, while excessive complexity or irrelevant information can increase uncertainty. We also show that ensemble techniques, such as Sigma-weighted aggregation across models and prompt variations, effectively improve reliability. Our findings have profound implications for the development of intelligent systems, emphasizing the critical role of prompt engineering and theoretical modeling in creating AI technologies that perceive, reason, and act predictably in the real world.},

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) based methods, especially deep learning methods, have shown promising performance in UOD. To further facilitate future advancements, we comprehensively study AI-based UOD. In this survey, we first categorise existing algorithms into traditional machine learning-based methods and deep learning-based methods, and summarise them by considering learning strategies, experimental datasets, learning stages, employed features or techniques, and underlying frameworks. Next, we discuss the potential challenges and suggest possible solutions and new directions. We also perform both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of mainstream algorithms across multiple benchmark datasets, taking into account the diversity and biases in experimental setups. Finally, we introduce two off-the-shelf detection analysis tools, Diagnosis and TIDE, which will examine the effects of object characteristics and various types of errors on detector performance. These tools help identify the strengths and weaknesses of different detectors, providing insights for further improvement.

Second, a Chinese UTAUT-based research (N=361) employing SEM-ANN hybrid analysis found that DeepSeek adoption intention is significantly determined by Perceived Price (β=0.346), Performance Expectancy (β=0.244), Effort Expectancy (β=0.233), eXplainable AI (β=0.126), and Facilitating Conditions (β=0.084), while Social Influence did not appear to be significant (β=−0.019). Moderator analysis found gender and education level to significantly moderate some predictor-intention relationships. Synthetically, these findings demonstrate: (a) cultural consensus in recognition of AI's value for learning in various capacities despite technical challenges, (b) the critical role of cost disclosure, usability, and explainability in adoption, and (c) stratified intervention needs to address technical instruction, ethical literacy, cost reduction, and maximization of usability – particularly through personalized learning deployments.

Then, we characterised and classified the current state of the art, focusing on 1) main aspects already tackled at the intersection of at least two of the three studied areas, and 2) findings emerging from the analysis as a framework for potential future research, notably regarding the integration of the three studied areas. The results reveal that few approaches combine MDE, AI/ML, and DevOps for software and systems engineering. In contrast, several approaches have combined two of them, specifically MDE and DevOps. Approaches combining AI/ML with MDE or DevOps are also becoming more frequent and will most likely continue to progress in the future.

 abstract = {There are a large number of violations of safety regulations at the construction site of the power grid. These behaviors do not comply with safety supervision norms and can cause significant safety hazards. In response to the problem of difficulty in capturing and alerting such violations, we have designed an intelligent recognition system for violations based on enhanced YOLOv5 and generative visual big models to automatically detect violations and potential safety hazards at the construction site of the power grid. We have constructed a private dataset of violations at the construction site of the power grid. In our improved YOLOv5 model, we first added a spatial channel attention mechanism to the Neck section of Yolov5 to enhance its ability to extract spatial features and distinguish between different channel features, enabling the network to better distinguish different targets. In addition, we have added a spatial attention mechanism after the SPP of the backbone network, which enables the network to fully utilize spatial information, extract more prominent features, and improve the accuracy and recall of the model. In addition, to compensate for the lack of negative samples in the dataset, we use a generative visual model to generate a large number of negative sample images to enhance the dataset and address the issue of insufficient negative samples. We have designed a real-time safety supervision intelligent system for detecting violations on construction sites based on the above model and method, using IoT devices such as on-site real-time cameras, intermediate data servers, and routers. We conducted extensive experiments on real construction site datasets, and the results showed that our method has significantly improved compared to the original model. The MAP of the system is 94.0\%, indicating that the model has strong detection ability and robustness in identifying personnel and safety tools in power grid construction site scenarios.},

 abstract = {With the rapid development of digital and intelligent technology, enterprises have encountered many difficulties in managing human resources. The problems of scattered data, untimely manual decision-making, and mismatch between employees and positions are becoming more and more common. Management methods that used to rely on personal experience or fixed rules can't keep up with the pace of business changes now. On the other hand, artificial intelligence, especially deep learning algorithm, brings new and promising solutions, which can handle human resources-related work more efficiently and accurately. This paper discusses the main challenges faced by human resource allocation in artificial intelligence environment, introduces how AI technology can help, and puts forward some improvement strategies using XGBoost algorithm. This model is not only supported by survey data, but also tested in actual scenes. The results show that this method works well and can really optimize the allocation of human resources. We hope that through this research, we can provide some practical suggestions for enterprises to adjust their human resource management in the AI era, and help them maintain their competitive advantage and operate more smoothly.},

 abstract = {Recently, as one of the most popular covert communication technologies, generative steganography has received ever-increasing attention due to its promising performance against sophisticated steganalysis tools. However, it is quite difficult for the existing generative steganographic approaches to find a good tradeoff between hiding capacity and extraction accuracy, mainly due to the small capacity of their hiding spaces. To overcome this shortcoming, a Progressive Generative Steganography (PGS) network architecture is proposed to hide a secret message during the progressive image generation process to realize secure covert communication. Specifically, we first propose a robust Secret-to-Noise (S2N) mapping method to encode the secret message as a set of noise maps. Then, guided by these noise maps, a set of corresponding images ranging from low resolution to high resolution are progressively generated by the Single Generative Adversarial Networks (SINGAN). Consequently, a large-sized secret message can be hidden in the finally generated high-resolution image, since a set of high-capacity hiding spaces can be provided by the process of progressive image generation. Moreover, to improve the quality of image generation and the accuracy of secret message extraction, a Dense Secret-Feature Connection (DSFC) strategy is designed and integrated into the proposed PGS network architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PGS outperforms the existing approaches in the aspects of both hiding capacity and message extraction, while maintaining promising anti-detectability and imperceptibility for covert communication.},

 abstract = {Flow-guided Localization (FGL) enables the identification of spatial regions within the human body that contain an event of diagnostic interest. FGL does that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations. Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets, enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models, including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels, and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust and scalable nanoscale localization.},

 abstract = {Generative AI has emerged as a transformative technology capable of reshaping public sector operations by streamlining administrative tasks, enhancing data analytics, and driving more personalized citizen interactions. Despite its potential, a critical gap remains in understanding how generative AI can be effectively integrated into government processes, particularly in developing countries like Indonesia, where bureaucratic inefficiencies and infrastructural constraints persist. This study addresses this gap by conducting a mixed-method investigation that combines a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of generative AI applications across multiple sectors to inform public service innovation, with expert interviews from key stakeholders Indonesian government, academic, and industry. The findings indicate that generative AI holds substantial promise for reducing manual processes, improving inter-agency coordination, and fostering data-driven decision-making. However, challenges related to ethical considerations, data privacy, and limited digital infrastructure present significant barriers to widespread adoption. By proposing a governance framework and offering strategic recommendations tailored to the Indonesian context, this research provides actionable insights for policymakers, government agencies, and technology providers. In doing so, it contributes to the evolving discourse on AI-driven public service innovation and offers a pathway toward realizing a more efficient and citizen-focused smart government in Indonesia.},

 abstract = {The industrial application of artificial intelligence technology is profoundly changing the competitive pattern of enterprises. However, small and medium-sized enterprises generally face bottlenecks such as high investment threshold, lack of talents and difficult scene adaptation in the process of technology landing. This study focuses on the feasibility discrimination problem of enterprise application of artificial intelligence technology, and proposes a deep learning framework based on LSTM-Transformer hybrid model. By integrating the three types of time series characteristics of enterprise basic information, business dynamics and technology application data, a multi-dimensional evaluation system is constructed. The model adopts layered architecture: LSTM layer captures short-term business fluctuations, Transformer layer mines long-term correlation between technical input and business effectiveness, and finally realizes two-classification of "feasible" and "temporarily infeasible" through Softmax. Based on the six-year data of 2006 enterprises, the mixed model accuracy reached 89.06\% (±0.31\%) and F1 score was 87.88\% (±0.36\%), which was significantly better than the single model and CNN-LSTM baseline. Confusion matrix shows that 93.7\% of high recall guarantees the identification of potential enterprises, and 74.4\% of specificity reveals negative class discrimination optimization space. This study provides a data-driven decision-making tool for SMEs to avoid technology investment risks.},

 abstract = {Recently, creative generative artificial intelligence software has emerged as a pivotal assistant, enabling users to generate content and seek inspiration rapidly. Text-to-Image (T2I) software, one of the most widely used, synthesizes images with text input by engaging in a cross-modal process. However, despite substantial advancements in the T2I engine, T2I software still encounters errors when generating complex or non-realistic scenes, including omitting focal entities, low image realism, and mismatched text-image information. The cross-modal nature of T2I software complicates error detection for traditional testing methods, and the absence of test oracles further exacerbates the complexity of the testing process. To fill this gap, we propose ACTesting, an Automated Cross-modal Testing Method of Text-to-Image Software, the first testing method explicitly designed for T2I software. ACTesting utilizes the metamorphic testing principle to address the oracle problem and identifies cross-modal semantic consistency as its fundamental Metamorphic relation (MR) by employing the Entity-relationship (ER) triples. We design three kinds of mutation operators under the guidance of MR and the adaptability density constraint to construct the new input text. After generating the images based on the text, ACTesting verifies whether MR is satisfied by detecting the ER triples across two modalities to detect the errors of T2I software. In our experiments across five popular T2I software, ACTesting effectively generates error-revealing tests, resulting in a decrease in text-image consistency by up to 20\% when compared to the baseline. Additionally, an ablation study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed mutation operators. The experimental results validate that ACTesting can reliably identify errors within T2I software.},

 abstract = {Virtual and Extended Reality technologies are increasingly adopted in fields such as healthcare, entertainment, and education. These applications heavily rely on Smart Eye-Wears (SEWs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide users with new ways to perceive their environment. However, SEWs face limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life. Offloading computations to external servers is a prominent example of edge computation. However, this also presents considerable challenges due to delays caused by varying network conditions and server workloads. This paper proposes self-adaptive techniques based on tabular reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the offloading of Deep Neural Network tasks between the SEW, the user’s smartphone, and cloud servers. The goal is to maintain a high-quality user experience while minimizing energy consumption and 5G connection costs. We evaluated our framework under varying 5G and WiFi bandwidths and cloud latency. The results show that Q-learning, SARSA, and Expected SARSA achieve near-optimal policies, with Q-learning demonstrating superior performance in reducing execution time violations (approximately at 10\%) and improving agent stability. Additionally, our approach offers a more favorable trade-off between energy efficiency and execution time violations compared to two baseline methods. Real-system experiments reveal that the proposed solution can double SEW battery life with respect to local computation while maintaining a good quality of service, with only 11\% execution time violations. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our approach in managing resources and enhancing the overall user experience in SEW AI applications.},

Past studies have largely undertaken a qualitative and manual approach to classifying different trends in the CI literature. This method risks missing a significant proportion of publications in the field. To this end, we present the first attempt to reflect the field to itself through an automated and quantitative descriptive approach using Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to collect and analyse 39,334 CI papers. We further focus our investigation on a subset of the CI literature, at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and CI to understand how these two fields are interacting. We show that while the annual number of CI-only publications has remained steady since 2015, AI+CI research has continued to increase. Publications in the crossover of AI+CI are growing at a faster rate than CI-only papers but show less topical and disciplinary breadth. This may be having a spillover effect on the topical focus of non-AI collective intelligence research. We hope this analysis sheds more light on the dynamics of the CI ecosystem.},

 abstract = {The boom in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and continuing growth of Voice Assistants (VAs) suggests their trajectories will converge. This conjecture aligns with the development of AI-driven conversational agents, aiming to utilise advance natural language processing (NLP) methods to enhance the capabilities of voice assistants. However, design guidelines for VAs prioritise maximum efficiency by advocating for the use of concise answers. This poses a conflict with the challenges around generative AI, such as inaccuracies and misinterpretation, as shorter responses may not adequately provide users with meaningful information. AI-VA systems can adapt drivers of trust formation, such as references and authorship, to improve credibility. A better understanding of user behaviour when using the system is needed to develop revised design recommendations for AI-powered VA systems. This paper reports an online survey of 256 participants residing in the U.K. and nine follow-up interviews, where user behaviour is investigated to identify drivers of trust in the context of obtaining digital information from a generative AI-based VA system. Adding references is promising as a tool for increasing trust in systems producing text, yet we found no evidence that the inclusion of references in a VA response contributed towards the perceived reliability or trust towards the system. We examine further variables driving user trust in AI-powered VA systems.},

 abstract = {The rapid advancements of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have recently led to renewed attention towards approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search and vector databases (VectorDB). Among various ANN methodologies, vector quantization techniques like product quantization (PQ) are widely used to generate space-efficient representations for large-scale dense vectors. However, the code-books generated by PQ often reach several gigabytes in size, making them impractical for web-scale, high-dimensional vectors in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices.In this study, we propose SegPQ, a simple yet effective framework for losslessly compressing codebooks generated by any PQ variants, enabling efficient in-memory vector search on devices with limited memory. SegPQ represents the raw PQ codewords as a trained error-bounded piecewise linear approximation model (ϵ-PLA) and pre-computed low-bit residuals. We theoretically demonstrate that, with high probability, the number of bits per compressed codeword is 1.721 + ⌈log2 ϵOPT⌉, where ϵOPT is the optimal error parameter that can be determined by data characteristics. To accelerate query execution, we further design SIMD-aware query processing algorithms on compressed codebooks to fully exploit the hardware parallelism offered by modern architectures. Extensive experimental studies on real datasets showcase that, for 1 billion vectors, SegPQ reduces PQ codebook memory consumption by up to 4.7x (approx. 851 MB) while incurring only 3.3\% additional query processing overhead caused by decompression.},

 abstract = {This paper introduces Generative Artificial Experts (GAEs) - a concept of a new type of generative AI agents designed for human-AI collaboration in knowledge work. GAEs have specialized domain expertise, perform tasks within bounded autonomy, include a synthetic persona and possess multimodal generative AI capabilities, among other features. We provide a definition of GAEs which includes seven defining traits, offering a taxonomy which sets them apart from other generative AI systems. We use literature-review based conceptual analysis with abductive reasoning to propose the new concept that addresses identified limitations in existing systems. The paper explores the emergence of GAEs as a leap from expert systems. We name two enablers for GAEs - ongoing development of a research field of human-AI collaboration and growing capabilities of generative artificial intelligence systems. We discuss existing generative AI agents, noting that GAEs as such do not exist yet, but are starting to emerge. Due conceptual nature of this paper we do not explore the technical aspects of GAEs development. Instead, we use illustrative examples to present possible applications of GAEs and their potential role in the future of knowledge work. This article appears in the AI \&amp; Society track.},

 abstract = {Often suffering from under-optimization, Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) heavily impact the efficiency of domain-specific Systems-on-Chip. To cope with this issue, heterogeneous NoCs are promising alternatives. Nevertheless, the design of optimized NoCs satisfying multiple performance objectives is extremely challenging and requires significant expertise. Prior works failed to combine many objectives or required an extended design space exploration time. In this paper, we propose an approach based on generative artificial intelligence to help pruning complex design spaces for heterogeneous NoCs, according to configurable performance objectives. This is made possible by the ability of Generative Adversarial Networks to learn and generate relevant design candidates for the target NoCs. The speed and flexibility of our solution enable a fast generation of optimized NoCs that fit users' expectations. Through some experiments, we show how to obtain competitive NoC designs reducing the power consumption with no communication performance or area penalty compared to a given conventional NoC design.},

 abstract = {An increasing number of studies use gender information to un-derstand phenomena such as gender bias, inequity in access and participation, or the impact of the Covid pandemic response. Un-fortunately, most datasets do not include self-reported gender in-formation, which makes it necessary for researchers to infer gen-der from other information, such as from names or names and country information. In this paper, we compare the performance of the new generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT with three traditional commercially available list-based and ma-chine learning-based gender inference tools—Namsor, Gender-API, and genderize.io—on a unique dataset. Specifically, we use a large Olympic athlete dataset and report how variations in the input (e.g., first name and first \&amp; last name, with and without country information) impact the accuracy of their predictions. We find that Namsor is the best traditional commercially available tool. However, ChatGPT performs at least as well as Namsor and often outper-forms it, especially for the female sample when country and/or last name information is available. We conclude ChatGPT may be a cost-effective tool for gender prediction.},

 abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence has made significant strides, producing text indistinguishable from human prose and remarkably photorealistic images. Automatically measuring how close the generated data distribution is to the target distribution is central to diagnosing existing models and developing better ones. We present MAUVE, a family of comparison measures between pairs of distributions such as those encountered in the generative modeling of text or images. These scores are statistical summaries of divergence frontiers capturing two types of errors in generative modeling. We explore three approaches to statistically estimate these scores: vector quantization, non-parametric estimation, and classifier-based estimation. We provide statistical bounds for the vector quantization approach.Empirically, we find that the proposed scores paired with a range of f-divergences and statistical estimation methods can quantify the gaps between the distributions of humanwritten text and those of modern neural language models by correlating with human judgments and identifying known properties of the generated texts. We demonstrate in the vision domain that MAUVE can identify known properties of generated images on par with or better than existing metrics. In conclusion, we present practical recommendations for using MAUVE effectively with language and image modalities.},

 abstract = {Before the advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, for example, ChatGPT, students traditionally approached assignment development authentically by employing libraries and by referring to textbooks. However, with the widespread reliance on powerful AI tools for assignment completion, the process has become more convenient. Unfortunately, this ease of use has led to a potential detriment in students' genuine understanding of subjects, as well as a decline in their problem-solving and innovative thinking skills. Moreover, AI tools like ChatGPT will evolve as technology advances such that the need to detect AI-generated content is even more crucial in educational setting to reinforce the value of original work [5]. This paper aims to address this issue by focusing on the detection of plagiarism in student assignments through the utilization of the Copyleaks1 tool, specifically designed to identify AI-generated code. The accuracy of the tool is systematically evaluated by submitting various pairs of codes, each with similar functionality, wherein one is generated by AI and the other by humans.},

Recently, I have been inundated with questions, concerns, and critiques about the rise of augmentation technologies in writing and design processes, particularly generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools that support chat-based text generation and text-to-image production. I'm sure many UX researchers and designers face similar issues in their work. It remains unclear how generative AI should fit into existing workflow or design processes. Common questions include these:• How does AI work? What can it do? Is it free?• Is it cheating if I use AI to produce content?• Who is responsible for the quality of AI-generated content?• To what extent can I outsource my routine work to AI? In other words, what's an acceptable threshold for using AI before it is considered too much?Specific to UX is the value (cost and labor versus gains and effects) of generative AI in the research and design of user-centered products. Students in my UX courses are increasingly worried about the presence of AI and, consequently, the relevance of their developing skill sets in UX. Educators are growing wary about the presence of AI in the context of teaching and learning; many form partially informed decisions on academic policies for AI usage.},

The training of these models largely involves human feedback, a procedure that faces challenges including intensive resource demands and subjective human preferences. In this work, we incorporate feedback provided by artificial intelligence (AI) models instead of relying entirely on human feedback. We propose a simulation optimization framework to train the language model. The objective function for training is approximated using feedback from both human and AI models. We employ the method of control variate to reduce the variance of the approximated objective function. Additionally, we provide a procedure for deciding the sample size to acquire preferences from both human and AI models. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed procedure enhances the performance of the language model.},

In this study, we demonstrate a novel application of GenAI for epidemic modeling.

We performed a series of simulations to quantify the impact of agent traits and the availability of information for health condition, virus, and government guidelines on the disease spread patterns in terms of peak time and epidemic duration. We also characterized the most influential factors in agents' decision-making using random forest model.},

In this paper, we explore the applicability of approval regulation - that is, regulation of a product that combines experimental minima with government licensure conditioned partially or fully upon that experimentation - to the regulation of frontier AI. There are a number of reasons to believe that approval regulation, simplistically applied, would be inapposite for frontier AI risks. Domains of weak fit include the difficulty of defining the regulated product, the presence of Knightian uncertainty or deep ambiguity about harms from AI, the potentially transmissible nature of risks, and distributed activities among actors involved in the AI lifecycle. We conclude by highlighting the role of policy learning and experimentation in regulatory development, describing how learning from other forms of AI regulation and improvements in evaluation and testing methods can help to overcome some of the challenges we identify.},

Through a Non-Western community-centered approach and grounded theory analysis of 5 focus groups from diverse Indian subcultures, we explore how T2I outputs to English input prompts depict Indian culture and its subcultures, uncovering novel representational harms such as exoticism and cultural misappropriation. These findings highlight the urgent need for inclusive and culturally sensitive T2I systems.

 abstract = {As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies evolve at an unprecedented rate, global governance approaches struggle to keep pace with the technology, highlighting a critical issue in the governance adaptation of significant challenges. Depicting the nuances of nascent and diverse governance approaches based on risks, rules, outcomes, principles, or a mix, across different regions around the globe, is fundamental to discern discrepancies and convergences, and to shed light on specific limitations that need to be addressed, thereby facilitating the safe and trustworthy adoption of GenAI. In response to the need and the evolving nature of GenAI, this paper seeks to provide a collective view of different governance approaches around the world. Our research introduces a Harmonized GenAI Framework, "H-GenAIGF", based on the current governance approaches of six regions: (European Union (EU), United States (US), China (CN), Canada (CA), United Kingdom (UK), and Singapore (SG)). We have identified four constituents, fifteen processes, twenty-five sub-processes, and nine principles that aid the governance of GenAI, thus providing a comprehensive perspective on the current state of GenAI governance. In addition, we present a comparative analysis to facilitate identification of common ground and distinctions based on coverage of the processes by each region. The results show that risk-based approaches allow for better coverage of the processes, followed by mixed approaches. Other approaches lag behind, covering less than 50\% of the processes. Most prominently, the analysis demonstrates that amongst the regions, only one process aligns across all approaches, highlighting the lack of consistent and executable provisions. Moreover, our case study on ChatGPT reveals process coverage deficiency, showing that harmonization of approaches is necessary to find alignment for GenAI governance.},

This paper presents the design and development process of Purry, a social robot inspired by cat behaviors, created to provide stress relief for university students. Purry was designed to offer emotional comfort in a unique way, harnessing the calming effects of pet-like interactions. The design process focused on achieving both aesthetic appeal and functional efficiency, combining modern and traditional technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and low-cost materials, following the double diamond methodology. The robot mimics feline behaviors like kneading and purring, exploring both active and passive tactile interactions, which have been shown to reduce stress through sensory stimulation. Iterative development cycles, guided by user feedback, led to significant advancements in balancing form and function. The final result is a robotic experience that combines emotional support with innovative design, offering a product that not only addresses students' mental health needs but also fosters an engaging and comforting presence in their environment.},
