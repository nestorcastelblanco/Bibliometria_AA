abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers promising potential for advancing human-AI collaboration in qualitative research. However, existing works focused on conventional machine-learning and pattern-based AI systems, and little is known about how researchers interact with GenAI in qualitative research. This work delves into researchers’ perceptions of their collaboration with GenAI, specifically ChatGPT. Through a user study involving ten qualitative researchers, we found ChatGPT to be a valuable collaborator for thematic analysis, enhancing coding efficiency, aiding initial data exploration, offering granular quantitative insights, and assisting comprehension for non-native speakers and non-experts. Yet, concerns about its trustworthiness and accuracy, reliability and consistency, limited contextual understanding, and broader acceptance within the research community persist. We contribute five actionable design recommendations to foster effective human-AI collaboration. These include incorporating transparent explanatory mechanisms, enhancing interface and integration capabilities, prioritising contextual understanding and customisation, embedding human-AI feedback loops and iterative functionality, and strengthening trust through validation mechanisms.},

Nevertheless, how to use ChatGPT to help teachers carry out personalised teaching has yet to be explored. Therefore, this paper explores and analyses the ways in which ChatGPT can help teachers carry out personalised teaching based on the connotation of ChatGPT and personalised teaching, and discusses the challenges faced when using ChatGPT to assist teachers in carrying out personalised teaching, from the perspective of the three aspects of teaching: lesson planning, instruction, and evaluation and feedback. It also discusses the challenges faced when using ChatGPT to assist teachers in personalised teaching and proposes strategies to address them. The study shows that artificial intelligence can make teachers more scientific, precise, intelligent and diversified in the process of implementing personalised teaching.},

From our experience in CS50, Harvard University's introductory course, we've seen firsthand the impactful role that generative artificial intelligence can play in education. Recognizing its potential and stakes, we integrated OpenAI's GPT into our own teaching methodology. The goal was to emulate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio, incorporating "pedagogical guardrails" to maintain instructional integrity. The result was a personalized, AI-powered bot in the form of a friendly rubber duck aimed at delivering instructional responses and troubleshooting without giving outright solutions. We plan to share our journey and offer insights into responsibly harnessing AI in educational settings. Participants will gain hands-on experience working with GPT through OpenAI's APIs, understanding and crafting prompts, answering questions using embedding-based search, and finally, building their own AI chatbot. Ultimately, we'll not only share lessons learned from our own approach but also equip educators hands-on with the knowledge and tools with which they, too, can implement these technologies in their unique teaching environments.},

In the current medical field, it is widely used in image recognition to diagnose patient symptoms, train clinical prediction models, and improve clinical workflow processes to avoid missing treatment opportunities. These methods have all achieved good results so far. Now, generative AI is also impacting the development of the medical field, not only generating prescriptions that match patient conditions but also being applied in generating medical images for data augmentation and simulating various pathological conditions, thereby aiding in training deep learning models. Stroke is a leading cause of death or disability, ranking as the second leading cause of death worldwide, next to cancer. If cancers were categorized individually, stroke would surpass all single diseases, making it a primary focus of research in brain disease treatment. There are already studies where generative AI has been used to create medical images, which are then manually evaluated by doctors to determine if they were generated by AI. In this project, we plan to generate CT images of strokes using generative AI and use a trained model (to diagnose stroke) to improve accuracy. Through this project, we hope to solve the problem of scarce stroke CT images while also providing support for training stroke-related models.},

abstract = {Design by Contract represents an established, lightweight paradigm for engineering reliable and robust software systems by specifying verifiable expectations and obligations between software components. Due to its laborious nature, developers hardly adopt Design by Contract in practice.    A plethora of research on (semi-)-automated inference to reduce the manual burden has not improved the adoption of so-called code contracts in practice.    This paper examines the potential of Generative AI to automatically generate code contracts in terms of pre- and postconditions for any Java project without requiring any additional auxiliary artifact.    To fine-tune two state-of-the-art Large Language Models, CodeT5 and CodeT5+, we derive a dataset of more than 14k Java methods comprising contracts in form of Java Modeling Language (JML) annotations, and train the models on the task of generating contracts.    We examine the syntactic and semantic validity of the contracts generated for software projects not used in the fine-tuning and find that more than 95\% of the generated contracts are syntactically correct and exhibit remarkably high completeness and semantic correctness.    To this end, our fully automated method sets the stage for future research and eventual broader adoption of Design by Contract in software development practice.},

abstract = {This study contributes to the global conversation on artificial intelligence (AI) literacy, with a specific focus on Uganda, a sub-Saharan African region that has received limited attention in AI education research. As AI becomes increasingly pervasive, it is essential to introduce AI concepts to young children to promote their AI literacy. However, the current landscape of AI education in Uganda is not well understood. To address this gap, this research explores a community-based approach to teaching AI and machine learning (ML) to young children in out-of-school settings. The study aims to discover the kinds of AI-related knowledge and skills that young children can develop and how they can learn about AI in a non-formal educational context. The study will employ a design science methodology (DSM) to create and evaluate practical solutions, including methods, models, and concepts, that can inform AI education in Uganda. By combining systematic literature reviews, qualitative and quantitative methods, the research will generate robust empirical evidence that supports the effectiveness and relevance of the proposed solutions. Through these methods, the research will explore the role of community-based approaches in fostering young children's AI literacy. The study will investigate the effectiveness of informal learning environments, including homes, museums, churches, and children's camps. This will provide design recommendations for community-based AI education programs and in doing so, the study addresses the limited initiatives on promoting AI education for everyone, particularly in developing regions using informal settings.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners. It is frequently used to address major security problems such as supply chain attacks, ransomware threats, and social engineering. In this context, integrating AI into cybersecurity workflows requires incorporating AI-driven approaches into the educational training of the cybersecurity workforce. This paradigm shift in academic settings will introduce the necessary skills for cybersecurity professionals to operate modern AI-based systems. Yet, the current cybersecurity curriculum still suffers from the absence of AI resources, particularly the detailed understanding of the appropriate AI mechanisms. Such absence leaves skill gaps for future professionals and practitioners in the industry. To address this, we designed an academic lecture module on AI covering both theory and practice. Then, we taught the module across six cybersecurity courses in our institution. To assess the effectiveness of integrating AI materials into cybersecurity education, we collected data by presenting two surveys before and after the lecture (concluding 81 participants per survey). Specifically, we utilized widely accepted models for unbiased analysis of our data. Our experimental results show positive AI knowledge improvement by 30\% of the participants, demonstrating the beneficial impact of the lecture. Then, we observed a high similarity score between the survey responses and the lecture content, reaching 84\%. Moreover, our sentiment analysis results reflect positive feedback from the participants with a positive score of 0.50. Overall, our study serves as a reference for instructional designers for developing educational curricula aiming to integrate AI into cybersecurity education.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for natural language understanding and text generation. An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step called LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on improving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as batching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify and map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of both processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators (e.g., GPUs). We observe that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a kernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet user and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and computation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach of designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even in memory-bound kernels.In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the dynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI (PA rallel Decoding with PI M), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that exploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to suitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel characterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware units at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that harmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units (GPU) and hybrid PIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on three broadly-used LLMs (i.e., LLaMA-65B, GPT-3 66B, and GPT-3 175B) show that PAPI achieves 1.8\texttimes{} and 11.1\texttimes{} speedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator (i.e., GPU and PIM) and a state-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively.},

While the need for frameworks and solutions to support AI governance is widely recognized, understanding and addressing the real-world needs of AI practitioners in operationalizing governance remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews using a design probe with AI governance practitioners across various industry sectors. Our findings provide insights into the experiences and pain points of industry practitioners in AI governance, highlighting key challenges in achieving performance goals, assessing societal impact, securing user data, and navigating technical difficulties. We also identified their technical and explainability needs, including practical guidance on addressing violations, as well as more detailed explanations of AI models, data, and evaluation.

These methodologies involve abstractive summarization, extracting the core content from an input text and transforming it into natural sentences. Unlike fact-based documents, opinion-based documents require a thorough analysis of sentiment and understanding of the writer’s intention. However, existing models do not explicitly consider these factors. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel text summarization model that is specifically designed for opinion-based documents. Specifically, we identify the sentiment distribution of the entire document and train the summarization model to focus on major opinions that conform to the intended message while randomly masking minor opinions. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing summarization models in summarizing opinion-based documents, effectively capturing and highlighting the main opinions in the generated abstractive summaries.},

We selected papers published since 2000 concerning the aforementioned applications, investigated the algorithms described therein, and compared their data performance in the testing sections to explore the advantages and disadvantages. Our findings reveal that SVM exhibits excellent performance in detecting attack traffic, whereas decision trees and their enhanced versions are less prominent. Additionally, genetic algorithms are not suitable for attack traffic detection but excel in filtering irrelevant traffic features. These insights hold significant implications for both real-world applications in enhancing cybersecurity measures and theoretical contributions by laying groundwork for future research in the rapidly evolving domain of DDoS attack mitigation. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive overview of the landscape of machine learning in DDoS defense, providing valuable insights and directions for future investigations.},

abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) supports early detection of learning difficulties by predicting student performance. However, machine learning models often operate as black boxes. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) helps to explain why black-box models produce specific predictions. This paper systematically reviews the past five years of research on XAI applications for interpreting student performance prediction in Computer Science and STEM education. We found that behavioral and academic performance data were the most commonly used features, with the main prediction goals focused on course failure risk or grades. This study also examined the application areas of XAI, revealing that the most common uses were global feature importance analysis, individual prediction explanations, and supporting interventions and decision-making. Moreover, we found that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were the most frequently utilized XAI technique, predominantly applied at the global level, with limited use at the individual level. Furthermore, a research gap was identified in utilizing XAI to support course improvements, customize visualizations, and generate personalized recommendations. Addressing this gap could enable educators to provide personalized, data-driven guidance to better support individual students.},

A questionnaire survey was conducted on 300 individuals in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and other cities, and quantitative technology was used to conduct data statistics and inspections on the access to artificial intelligence of various social classes. High-income groups clearly occupy an advantageous position in the access and application of artificial intelligence technology. Their access frequency, application depth and technology dependence are far greater than those of low-income groups. Data analysis shows that there are significant differences in the adoption and application of artificial intelligence technology among social classes. Groups with weak economic foundations face the difficulties of lack of education and resources, and face a large technical threshold for technology access.

Particularly in Africa, the technology is expected to solve societal challenges, leapfrog, and promote sustainable communities. The literature presents examples of AI use cases in Africa to exemplify the opportunities, benefits, challenges, and risks of AI. Also, available reports highlight similar narratives with recommendations to improve the status quo. While such recommendations are essential, assessing what actions have already been implemented toward AI adoption is equally important. Still, more research is needed to showcase a holistic view of efforts taken by African countries to prepare for planning and implementing AI responsibly. This paper bridges the gap by examining the readiness of AI adoption in African countries from the literature using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. Findings reveal the need for further initiatives to realize the positive outcomes of AI technologies. The paper concludes by proposing the research areas that require further exploration from the context of African countries.},

In many network texts, sentiment analysis of each entity has always been an important issue. The traditional Bi-LSTM model has the problem of gradient explosion or excessive correction in the learning rate, which affects the convergence speed and stability of the model. In this paper, a Bi-LSTM optimization model combining progressive preheating and cosine annealing is proposed, which uses word embedding technology, word shape reduction technology and named entity recognition technology. Experiments show that our model can achieve high accuracy on both the training set and the verification set, and the loss is gradually reduced. It shows an accuracy of up to 84.13 \% in both positive and negative categories, which is significantly better than the existing baseline model. Through in-depth comparative analysis, the model shows obvious advantages in key performance indicators such as accuracy, recall rate and F1 value.},

abstract = {Current research on the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on adolescent development yields mixed results, and parents are left to navigate this emerging technology without clear support and knowledge. A missing step toward effective digital parenting is understanding parents’ concerns and beliefs. Therefore, this preliminary study explores parental perspectives on the use and impact of GenAI on adolescents aged 13 to 17. We conducted a survey with N = 159 parents from 19 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Findings suggest that most parents are unaware of how their children use GenAI and feel disconnected from them on this topic. Importantly, while parents recognise the opportunities and risks of GenAI, their views vary based on their own familiarity with the technology, with those who use it regularly being significantly more optimistic about its impact on adolescents’ development. These results highlight a gap in digital parenting when it comes to adolescents’ use of GenAI, underscoring the need for a systematic approach to parental support. Future work will expand the survey into a larger-scale study and incorporate adolescents’ perspectives.},

Afterward, five examples were correlated to influence the design of an immersive and responsive 360° theatre system using specific combinations of artificial intelligence models to aid subjective recall. In this immersive space, storyteller preferences for edited content are finally made available for new users, thereby affording new collaborative storytelling about a cultural heritage site.

abstract = {Conventional 95598 customer service spillover risk prediction method mainly uses SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling) minority oversampling method to deal with the prediction samples, which is susceptible to the influence of weighted fusion, resulting in poor prediction results, therefore, a new 95598 customer service spillover risk prediction method needs to be designed based on the correlation clustering of data, i.e., collecting and processing the complaint spillover risk prediction data, designing the customer service spillover risk prediction algorithm using data correlation clustering, and thus realizing the customer service spillover risk prediction. Therefore, it is necessary to design a new 95598 customer service complaint spillover risk prediction method based on data association clustering, i.e., we collected and processed the complaint spillover risk prediction data, and designed a customer service complaint spillover risk prediction algorithm by using data association clustering, so as to realize the customer service complaint spillover risk prediction. The experimental results show that the designed customer service complaint spillover risk prediction method based on data association clustering has good prediction effect, and the predicted root mean square error (RMSE), predicted mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and predicted mean absolute error (MAE) are low, reliable, and have certain application value, which makes a certain contribution to the improvement of customer service quality.},

To address this issue, we propose a meta-learning method that integrates multilingual knowledge, which mainly includes two modules: the multilingual knowledge obtain module, which alleviates data scarcity by introducing multilingual knowledge from outside; The meta-learning module utilizes ProtoMAML combined with l₂ standardization to extract language independent causal features from text and learn better event representations in different languages. The experimental results on the latest publicly available MECI dataset show that our model outperforms the current best baseline, with an average F1 improvement of 3.9\% in different languages.},

abstract = {The accurate decoding and intention recognition of motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) are of great significance for the implementation of brain computer interface (BCI). However, the time non-stationary properties of MI-EEG signals and the uneven information distribution of different electrode channels pose challenges to the classification of MI-EEG. To address these challenges, we proposed a convolutional network based on channel and temporal attention (CTACNet). First, raw MI-EEG signals underwent noise reduction by common average reference. Subsequently, channel attention module was used to enhance the electrode channel information related to classification. Then, shallow spatiotemporal features of MI-EEG were extracted through convolutional neural network, and time series representations containing spatial information were output. Importantly, time attention module automatically adjusted and learned the impact of different time series on classification. Finally, deep spatiotemporal features were further extracted through time convolutional network, and fully connected layers were used to complete the classification of MI-EEG. Validation experiments based on the BCI competition IV-2a dataset showed that the proposed CTACNet achieved an average classification accuracy of 84.22\% for each subject. Compared with MBEEGSE, ETCNet, EEG-TCNet, and CNN-LSTM, there were significant improvements of 2.20\%, 9.42\%, 4.50\%, and 5.40\%, respectively. This demonstrates the potential of CTACNet in significantly enhancing MI-EEG decoding and intent recognition.},

The model demonstrates that the effect of redemptions on asset prices is linear, and the subsequent impact on fund performance is contingent on the initial shock level and asset liquidity diversity. Our findings suggest that funds those holding illiquid stocks face higher liquidity risks, and the liquidity level of underlying common assets between mutual fund portfolios dictates the extent of losses in the liquidated stock prices and the connected fund NAVs. Second, higher liquidity levels of common assets result in lower level of portfolio overlap. These findings highlight the urgency of establishing unified liquidity standard measurements and a cash buffer criterion. To manage fund stability and liquidity effectively, it is essential to implement measures such as minimum cash requirements and optimized asset allocation. These strategies have been proven to offer valuable insights for achieving financial success.},

abstract = {As an indispensable and easily damaged part in large equipment, bearings were of great significance for their rapid and accurate fault diagnosis. The working environment of bearings was usually harsh and complicated. In order to improve the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis under strong noise, an improved IRGShuffleNet network structure was proposed. The initial multi-scale structure based on LIBP was innovatively used to extract the shallow feature information of the network. Features were extracted from high-dimensional data using the inverted residual structure, and redundant feature maps were generated in a cheaper way by Ghost convolution. Random depth structure and flooding regularization were used to prevent overfitting of the model. To evaluate the validity of the proposed model, a series of comparative experiments were conducted. Compared with the standard residual network, the accuracy of the model proposed in this paper was improved by 5.90\% and 9.72\% respectively under -4dB and -10dB noise. The model parameter was reduced from 25.7M to 1.98M, FLOPs were reduced by about 75.2\%, and other performance indicators were also improved at different amplitudes. These results showed that the proposed model had good diagnostic adaptability.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of science and technology, system security is facing an increasing number of threats, among which system vulnerabilities have brought serious challenges to information security. In such an environment, system logs, as key data that record the operating status of computer systems, user operations and various events, play an extremely important role in monitoring system health and quickly locating and resolving system failures. However, the current accuracy of log parsing is not high enough to meet the actual demand; the parsing process is inefficient and difficult to adapt to the processing requirements of large data log files. Aiming at the problems of insufficient accuracy of log parsing and low efficiency of parsing process, a log parsing method AT-parser (Log parser based on word attributes and parse trees) is proposed. Through the log preprocessing, the log content used in the subsequent construction of log templates can be separated, the log content combined with word attribute filtering, retaining the key words, constructing a string set through the key words, and then performing similarity clustering based on the string set to classify the log strings into different log groups. Finally, the final template sequence is generated by constructing a parse tree, which improves the accuracy and speeds up the parsing efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness of AT-Parser is verified by experiments on public datasets.},

Based on re-parameterization, a multi-level feature generation module (MFGM) is designed to extract feature mappings from different perspectives. Then, to enhance feature details, a feature refinement module (FRM) is constructed to aggregate high-frequency information, which can assign weight values to pixels in feature maps according to the importance of different hierarchical features. Through many experiments, our proposed method shows excellent image reconstruction results in a lightweight way on multiple benchmark datasets and exceeds the current advanced methods.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of 5G and mobile internet, various application fields continue to generate diverse dynamic streaming graphs with large scales and complex structures. Analyzing, querying and mining such a streaming graph face great challenges. To address the challenge of low query efficiency and avoid data loss, this paper proposes a two-stage coarsening method that preserves key features of a streaming graph while improves query efficiency. In the initial stage, the size of the streaming graph is not that large yet. To preserve its structure and attributes as much as possible, a linear mapping method is used for graph coarsening. As the size of the streaming graph increases, a graph neural network model based on cluster pooling is constructed in the second stage. Using a large number of graph coarsening results obtained in the initial stage to train and optimize this model. Then, we use this optimized model to obtain the subsequent summaries, which achieves online efficient graph coarsening. Finally, extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm significantly improves the quality of streaming graph coarsening compared to traditional algorithms. Even compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm Auxo, our algorithm shows a better performance on preserving key features.},

abstract = {While educational researchers in various disciplines are grappling with how to develop policies and pedagogical approaches that address the use of generative artificial intelligence, the challenge is particularly complex in computer science education where the new technology is changing the core of the field. In this paper, we take a look at the pedagogy of other subjects with a longer history than computer science and a more extensive body of educational research to collect insights on how this challenge can be met. We begin by drawing from recent neurological research to find domains that share cognitive commonalities with computer programming and then build upon comparisons that others have made to literacy and mathematics education. We then consider how the "reading wars" and "math wars" have shaped these fields, which we see as conflicts between less effective top-down pedagogy and more effective bottom-up pedagogy, and reflect on what would be comparable approaches in teaching computing. We find that approaches that make heavy use of large language models without teaching fundamentals can be compared to the top-down pedagogy of reading and mathematics and are likely to be ineffective on their own. Therefore, we advise against the exclusive use of such approaches with novices. However, we also acknowledge that the social science surrounding computer science education is complex and that effectiveness only tells a part of the story, with other factors such as engagement, motivation and social dynamics also being important.},

abstract = {Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress and been widely applied across various industries. However, a series of significant challenges have also been posed, such as the hallucination, where the generated attributes of a target are inconsistent with the information in the image. Recent works have primarily focused on improving generation performance by training the multimodal alignment module of the model with additional data. However, this approach incurs higher costs and introduces redundant information due to the reliance on large amounts of additional data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal mitigation framework, termed MH-PEFT. Specifically, we introduce an effective data augmentation strategy that leverages existing data to generate additional attribute-related information, thereby enhancing the model's generative capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a PEFT-based training approach specifically tailored to mitigate multimodal hallucination in LVLMs. Notably, our framework features a plug-and-play design, which enhances its robustness and facilitates its deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.},

Enhancing the capability for early warning of online public opinion crises is urgent. The most effective approach is to identify potential crises in their early stages and implement corresponding management measures. This study establishes a preliminary indicator system for online public opinion early warning, based on the principles of indicator system construction and the characteristics and evolution patterns of online public opinion. Subsequently, data-driven methodologies were employed to collect and preprocess public opinion indicator data. Utilizing grey relational analysis and the K-Means clustering algorithm, we classified online public opinion events into three levels: slight, warning, and severe. Furthermore, we constructed an online topic evolution model using the online Hierarchical Dirichlet Process model to analyze the thematic changes of online public opinion events across different warning levels. Finally, we developed an online public opinion early warning model using a Backpropagation (BP) neural network. The test results of early warning samples show that the model achieves high accuracy. Thus, in practical early warning applications, the BP neural network can be effectively utilized for predicting online public opinion events.},

abstract = {Online public opinion is increasingly becoming a significant factor affecting the stability of the internet and society, particularly as the frequency of online public opinion crises has risen in recent years. Enhancing the capability for early warning of online public opinion crises is urgent. The most effective approach is to identify potential crises in their early stages and implement corresponding management measures. This study establishes a preliminary indicator system for online public opinion early warning, based on the principles of indicator system construction and the characteristics and evolution patterns of online public opinion. Subsequently, data-driven methodologies were employed to collect and preprocess public opinion indicator data. Utilizing grey relational analysis and the K-Means clustering algorithm, we classified online public opinion events into three levels: slight, warning, and severe. Furthermore, we constructed an online topic evolution model using the online Hierarchical Dirichlet Process model to analyze the thematic changes of online public opinion events across different warning levels. Finally, we developed an online public opinion early warning model using a Backpropagation (BP) neural network. The test results of early warning samples show that the model achieves high accuracy. Thus, in practical early warning applications, the BP neural network can be effectively utilized for predicting online public opinion events.},

abstract = {Accurate positioning and pose estimation of mobile robots in structured environments have persistently presented considerable challenges. This paper proposes SLP-SLAM, a multifeature fusion stereo simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system that combines both structural lines and structural planes. We have enhanced the effectiveness of the method for extracting structural lines using the Manhattan World Assumption (MWA) and have suggested utilizing these lines to construct structural planes, which is different from the existing plane extraction methods. Furthermore, we develop the state estimator by minimizing the visual residuals of points, structural lines, and structural planes. As far as we know, this represents the inaugural stereo SLAM that concurrently employs points, structural lines, and structural planes for integrated optimization. An appraisal of our system on difficult public datasets has been conducted. The trajectory error associated with SLP-SLAM has been diminished by 15\% in comparison to contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) SLAM.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools utilize machine learning models to create new content in response to human-provided prompts, which can automate the creation of large amounts of content in a short time. This study analyzed students' information behavior in small group discussions where the students were encouraged to use generative AI tools. Descriptive and lag sequential analysis methods were employed to examine the characteristics and patterns of students' information behavior according to Ellis' model of information seeking. The results indicated that although students frequently used generative AI tools as primary information sources, they also sought additional resources to satisfy their informational needs. Additionally, students sometimes copied and pasted useful information from generative AI tools into group documents to share with their group members. Lag sequential analysis revealed that students typically began their information seeking process with generative AI tools, followed by exploring additional information sources.},
