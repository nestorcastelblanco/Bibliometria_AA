The method converts natural language scripts into semantic action labels, retrieves and stitches action segments from a 2D pose fragment library (PoseDB), and uses transition frame interpolation and structural regularization to generate coherent and natural animation sequences. The method features low computational cost, structured control, and strong scalability, suitable for applications in education, advertising, and product demonstrations.

abstract = {Effective university–industry collaboration remains elusive, largely because firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, struggle to identify trustworthy academics whose expertise aligns with their technical needs. We address this problem by introducing MMKG-SNR, a ranking framework that fuses (i) a Multimodal Knowledge Graph (MMKG) grounding textual and visual evidence from publications and patents with (ii) an enriched Social-Network (SN) graph that captures citation ties, institutional links, and fine-grained company–scholar interaction logs obtained from the Jiangxi Online Technology Trading Platform (OTTP). Requirement texts are used as external keys in a hand-in-hand dual-stream Transformer to retrieve context from the MMKG, while RotatE embeddings model relational trust in the SN graph, augmented with newly formalized company–scholar edges. The two signal sources are combined through a query-conditioned gating mechanism, and a pairwise Bayesian Personalized Ranking loss trains a two-layer neural scorer to optimize the final ordering. Experiments on real OTTP collaboration cases show that MMKG-SNR improves recall and nDCG over strong content-only and trust-only baselines, demonstrating its ability to surface scholars who are both technically relevant and socially credible. Ablation analyses confirm that requirement-anchored keys, company–scholar edges, and the learn-to-rank objective each contribute significant, complementary gains. The framework provides a reproducible, extensible blueprint for reducing information asymmetry and accelerating knowledge transfer in technology-driven economies.},

Our designed agent architecture includes three core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics, quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against rewritten content.

Insurers who want to secure the highest customer satisfaction level and service quality can no longer ignore the necessity of personal intelligent customer service. But, on the flip side, these existing systems still have problems with comprehensive knowledge, human-like dialogue, and actual estimation. This paper presents a technique for developing personalized dialogue in intelligent customer service applications to the insurance business. Our model establishes an insurance knowledge base and utilizes the retrieval-augmented generation approach. In addition, we create dynamic memory by connecting the long short-term memory module, allowing the system to retrieve and modify customer's information while interacting with them in real time. As a result, intelligent models offer much more natural and engaging conversations, adjusting to specific tones and retaining individual emotions. These virtual assistants customize the responses according to the customer profiles. Hence, they give appropriate, professional, and personalized insurance advice.},

abstract = {Credit card fraud is assuming growing proportions as a major threat to the financial position of American household, leading to unpredictable changes in household economic behavior. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns, increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from classical ANFIS which has fixed input–output relations since it integrates fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal correlation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show that the RMSE was reduced by 17.8\% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and conventional LSTM models.},

Such advancements significantly improve treatment outcomes, reduce surgical risks, and lower the incidence of postoperative complications. To address the poor performance of TransU-Net on small datasets and the issue of the loss of local information, we introduce a hierarchical feature extraction structure similar to the nnUNet [2] baseline network so that the algorithm can adapt to small sample datasets without compromising TransU-Net's capability for large sample operations or its transferable potential. Based on TransU-Net [1], this experiment proposes an algorithm designed for abdominal multi-organ segmentation on small sample training datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves a higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and a lower loss value while maintaining a nearly constant quantity of parameters. Compared with the NestedUNet model, which excels in small sample operations, the proposed model improves IoU by 2\%. Compared to the lightweight TransU-Net model, it increases IoU by 10\% and reduces the loss value by 5\%.},

abstract = {The low-resource named entity recognition (NER) task faces the dual challenges of sparse annotation data and under-utilised syntactic structures. In this paper, we propose the Syntax-CLNP model, which solves the above problems through two core innovations: firstly, we design the Syntax-Aware Adapter, which dynamically injects dependent syntactic features by using differentiable syntactic projectors to realise semantic-syntactic collaborative characterisation; secondly, we propose the Contrastive Prototype Alignment (CPA) mechanism, which integrates contrastive learning and prototype network to strengthen the syntactic structure by gradient decoupling and enhance the syntactic structure through gradient decoupling. Prototype Alignment (CPA) mechanism is proposed, which integrates contrastive learning and prototype network, and strengthens intra-class feature compactness and inter-class separation through gradient decoupling to suppress noise interference. The experimental results show that on low resource datasets such as LingNER-40 (40 languages) and WikiANN, the F1 value of Syntax-CLNP is improved by 8.7\% on average compared with the baseline model (p&lt;0.01), the number of parameters increases by only 1\% (111M), and the increase in inference latency is less than 4\% (8.5ms), which achieves a balance between performance and efficiency. In the cross-language migration test, the model achieves 58.9\% F1 in low-resource scenarios such as Tamil (&lt;1k samples), verifying the generalisation capability. The study achieves the first end-to-end joint optimisation of syntactic tree and representation learning, providing an efficient solution for low-resource multilingual NER tasks.},

The experimental workflow involves data preprocessing, model implementation, visualization (word clouds, topic distributions, and similarity heatmaps), and quantitative evaluation. Results indicate that BERTopic excels in semantic coherence and topic diversity due to its transformer-based embeddings, making it ideal for interpretability in news analysis, while TF-IDF + KMeans offers superior speed for large-scale applications, and LDA provides a balanced probabilistic baseline. An ablation study on BERTopic components further validates the contributions of UMAP, HDBSCAN, and c-TF-IDF.

Experimental results demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in terms of dissemination coverage, user engagement, and transmission efficiency.

Through multiple linear regression algorithm and inverted U-shape test, it is proved that industrial collaborative agglomeration has a significant positive correlation to urban innovation ability and presents a nonlinear relationship, which is manifested as inverted U-shape characteristics. Using the XGBoost-SHAP machine learning algorithm, we further tested the contribution of each variable to the improvement of urban innovation capability. It is also found that the degree of urban industrial collaborative agglomeration, the level of urban human capital and the level of urban digital development are the key driving factors of the level of urban innovation capability in China.},

abstract = {This study constructs a machine learning-driven multi-factor model for Ethereum quantitative trading, combining traditional technical indicators (RSI, MACD), on-chain metrics (gas usage, active addresses), and X platform social sentiment to predict short-term returns. Backtesting from Q4 2021 to Q3 2024, using online learning and genetic algorithms for dynamic factor updates, yields a 97\% annualized return, a Sharpe ratio of 2.5, and an information ratio of 1.2, outperforming Ethereum's raw returns. Simulated trading in Q4 2024 (bull market) achieves a 33\% quarterly return with an 18\% maximum drawdown, while Q1 2025 (bear market) records a -10\% quarterly return with a 12\% drawdown, confirming robustness. Technical and sentiment factors drive performance, though a 22\% maximum drawdown in backtesting highlights volatility risks. An optimal Z-score threshold (±1.0) and 4-hour trading frequency balance profitability and costs. Future enhancements include high-frequency mainnet data integration and advanced risk management to strengthen model resilience in Ethereum's volatile market.},

abstract = {Against the backdrop of increasingly severe global environmental issues, the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) has received extensive attention and research from both the industry and academia due to its significant role in resource conservation. To explore the impact of government subsidies and the fair concern behavior of third-party recyclers on the decision-making and member utility of CLSC, this paper constructs a three-layer model of CLSC composed of manufacturers, retailers and third-party recyclers, and studies the Stackelberg game situation dominated by retailers. Third-party recyclers take the retailer's profit as the reference point for fair concern, and their utility function includes profit and fair concern loss. The government provides subsidies to enterprises that produce remanufactured products. In this paper, the inverse solution method is adopted to derive the equilibrium solution of the game, and Stackelberg game theory is applied for analysis and case simulation. The research results show that under the dominance of retailers, the utility of manufacturers and retailers is not affected by the fairness concern coefficient of recyclers, and the relationship between the utility of recyclers and the fairness relationship coefficient depends on the level of government subsidies. Subsidies increase the profits of retailers.},

abstract = {In a complex and volatile economic environment, accurately predicting the financial risks of enterprises is of vital importance to investors, creditors and regulatory authorities. This study proposes an interpretable hybrid machine learning model, ExHybridNet, for enterprise financial risk prediction. This model effectively captures dynamic nonlinear relationships in financial data through a three-path fusion architecture of convolutional neural networks, attention mechanism and random forest. ExHybridNet also provides transparent feature importance explanations through SHAP analysis. Based on the financial and audit data of listed companies on the Shenzhen and Beijing stock Exchanges in the CSMAR database from 2005 to 2024, ExHybridNet significantly outperforms traditional machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine), deep learning models (CNN, MLP), and hybrid machine learning (RF-CNN, CNN-Attention) in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1 score. The research results of SHAP analysis have revealed the roles of risk drivers such as high leverage ratio (D/A) and short-term borrowing dependence (STBD), as well as risk mitigation factors such as profit stability (EV) and tangible asset ratio (TAR), providing actionable insights for enterprise financial management, risk prevention and risk control.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an innovative multimodal emotion perception framework to improve the accuracy of financial volatility prediction by fusing social media graphic data. Traditional studies mainly rely on a single textual modality, which makes it difficult to capture the implicit emotions in visual information and the scarcity of labelled data in the financial domain. In this paper, we propose three core innovations: combining social media text (e.g., comments) and images (e.g., emoticons, news screenshots) to achieve adaptive fusion of graphical and textual features through a cross-modal attention mechanism to improve the completeness of emotion representation; adopting a two-stage strategy of pre-training and fine-tuning; and utilising a general multimodal dataset (MVSA) to pre-train the model, and using a two-stage strategy of pre-training to fine-tune the model. The two-stage strategy of ‘pre-training-fine-tuning’ is adopted to pre-train the model using the Universal Multimodal Data Set (MVSA), and then fine-tune it with the financial domain corpus to alleviate the problem of data scarcity; the multimodal sentiment factor is embedded into the classical HAR volatility model to construct the Sentiment-HAR model, and the leading effect of sentiment index on volatility is verified by the Granger causality test (γ=0.15,p=0.001). The experimental results show that the multimodal fusion model sentiment classification accuracy reaches 78\% (8.3\% improvement over the single-text model), and the sentiment index is significantly positively correlated with market volatility (Pearson r=0.32p&lt;0.01). The model robustly captures the dynamic correlation between sentiment and volatility during extreme events such as the COVID-19 epidemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This study provides new theoretical and instrumental support for financial sentiment analysis and quantitative trading strategy design.},

As GenAI integration in higher education grows, understanding its influence on critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity is essential. Using a mixed-effects model, we synthesized data from quantitative studies to explore two moderators: cognitive skill level (e.g., understanding, applying, analyzing) and instructional context (instructed vs. unguided use). Our findings indicate that GenAI tools significantly enhance lower-order cognitive outcomes, particularly in understanding and applying concepts, with instructed use producing stronger positive effects than unguided use. However, their impact on higher-order cognitive skills, such as creating and evaluating, was minimal. These results highlight the importance of tailoring GenAI integration to task complexity and underscore the value of guided instruction in maximizing its educational benefits. Educators should prioritize instructional strategies that encourage active engagement with GenAI tools, particularly for fostering critical thinking and creativity.},

abstract = {The advancement of smart education has made personalized learning path recommendation a key focus area for enhancing the quality of online teaching. To address the limitations of existing recommendation systems in modeling learner interaction structures and adapting to dynamic learning contexts, this paper proposes a learning path optimization model that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The proposed approach constructs a heterogeneous graph to capture multidimensional relationships among students, courses, and knowledge concepts, and leverages GNNs to generate structure-aware node representations. Based on this, a path generation policy network is developed using the PPO algorithm, enabling dynamic and adaptive optimization of personalized learning paths. Experiments conducted on a simulated educational dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in path accuracy, course completion rate, knowledge gain, and recommendation diversity. It also shows enhanced robustness in cold-start scenarios and better control over cognitive coherence. An ablation study further verifies the contribution of key components to overall system performance. This work provides a scalable framework for structural modeling and policy optimization in personalized learning, offering valuable insights for the intelligent development of educational recommendation systems.},

abstract = {To investigate the actual emission reduction effect of green bonds under China's "dual carbon" strategy, this study conducts a quasi-natural experiment using a Propensity Score Matching and Difference-in-Differences (PSM-DID) model on a sample of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2016 to 2023. The findings indicate that green bond issuance significantly promotes corporate green transformation, reducing the issuer's carbon emission intensity by an average of 13.8\%. This effect is partially mediated by the promotion of corporate green innovation. However, this reduction effect is not unconditional; it is statistically insignificant for bonds with a low proportion of committed funds or those lacking credible third-party certification, which reveals the existence of "greenwashing" in the market. Further analysis shows the reduction effect is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and heavily polluting industries, highlighting that policy pressure and industrial demand are key drivers for the effectiveness of green finance. Therefore, to ensure the environmental integrity of the green bond market, regulators must strengthen information disclosure standards, promote third-party certification, and establish an evaluation framework based on actual environmental performance. Such measures would effectively curb greenwashing and channel capital toward a genuinely sustainable future.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, its application in the field of language culture and visual presentation has attracted widespread attention. As an important part of China's regional culture, the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing have unique phonetic, lexical and grammatical characteristics. However, with the advancement of modernization, the inheritance and revitalization of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing face many challenges. This paper takes the visual transformation of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing as the research object, and explores how to integrate artificial intelligence technology into the workshop design strategy with the visual transformation of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing as the research object, so as to achieve the symbolic translation and multi-dimensional visualization presentation of the dialects. The study first extracted the representative vocabulary of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing and analyzed their visual transformation needs. Combining the advantages of artificial intelligence technology, the action research method was used to establish a workshop based on a multimodal transformation framework such as speech recognition and image generation. Through case analysis and practical verification, this paper demonstrates the application effect of artificial intelligence technology in the dialect visual transformation workshop, including the visualization of dialect words, the visualization of dialect stories, and the interactive experience of dialect culture. The research conclusion is: the icons generated by generative artificial intelligence integrated into the visual transformation of dialects can be seen to have more concrete symbols and fewer symbolic symbols. These will gradually change as the participants are "tamed" by artificial intelligence. In the graphic symbols generated by combining symbols, we can find two types of combination: international symbols and regional symbols. This provides an experimental paradigm for the design with dialect as the carrier, and also provides a reference for the discussion of the spread and regeneration of dialect.},

Firstly, a lightweight HRNet posture recognition model with an attention mechanism was constructed. On a self-built dataset containing 100 subjects (covering movements such as running and basketball shooting), the key point detection accuracy reached 92.3\% (PCK@0.5). Secondly, an action error quantification algorithm based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) was designed. By comparing the key point position deviations (averaging a reduction of 3.2 centimeters) and joint angle errors (averaging a reduction of 5.7°) between the subjects' movements and the standard templates of professional athletes, precise correction suggestions were generated. Finally, through experiments, the action correction effect of this system was recognized by sports experts at 89.6\%, with an efficiency improvement of over 40\% compared to traditional manual correction. The study demonstrates that the posture recognition technology driven by deep learning can effectively enhance the automation and scientificity of sports movement correction, providing technical support for sports training and national fitness.},

abstract = {In the context of ecological civilization construction, green consumption is of great significance to sustainable development. The generation mechanism and influencing factors of green consumption willingness are worth exploring in depth. Based on consumer value perception and value-belief-norm theory, this study obtained 356 valid samples through questionnaires, with the help of SPSSAU platform to explore the influence of perceived value and sustainable consumption on the willingness to consume green, and the moderating effect of price sensitivity. The results show that the functional, emotional, social, and green values all positively and significantly affect green consumption intention. Also price sensitivity negatively moderates the relationship between perceived value and consumption intention. And sustainable consumption outlook strengthens environmental protection beliefs and ethical norms, and becomes the core driving force of green consumption intention. To further explore consumer heterogeneity, k-means clustering was applied to seven variables. The optimal number of clusters was determined to be two, clearly separating consumers into a price-sensitive group with lower green intention and a high-value-perception group with stronger willingness to consume green. Based on these results, the study proposes the construction of a multi-dimensional value perception system, the implementation of differentiated price strategies, the promotion of sustainable consumption concept education and other guiding paths, to provide theoretical and practical support for the government and enterprises to promote the transformation of green consumption.},

To address the increasing complexity of cigarette transportation tasks, coordinated multi-vehicle distribution through route optimization has become a key strategy to enhance delivery efficiency and reduce costs. This study formulates a mathematical model for the multi-vehicle cigarette distribution routing problem, aiming to minimize total transportation costs, and employs the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for solution. To address the issue of imbalanced task allocation among vehicles observed in the WOA solution process, the algorithm is enhanced to achieve balanced distribution of delivery tasks while minimizing transportation costs.

While these tools promise to enhance programmer productivity, their impact on Time-Constrained Coding Challenges (TCCs), such as competitive programming, hackathons, and technical interviews remains poorly understood. TCCs are fundamental to both educational assessment and professional recruitment in software engineering. Integrating GenAI tools in these environments raises critical questions about skill development, assessment validity, and the nature of programming expertise. Current research lacks a systematic understanding of how GenAI tools influence programmer performance and learning outcomes in time-constrained environments. This gap is particularly concerning as educational institutions and industry organizations struggle to establish guidelines for GenAI use in TCCs. Without proper frameworks for integration, there are risks of: (1) Over-reliance on AI, potentially compromising fundamental skill development, and (2) Misalignment between traditional evaluation metrics and emerging co-intelligent programming practices. This doctoral research proposal aims to explore potential solutions for these issues.},

abstract = {While online advertising is highly dependent on implicit interaction networks of anonymous users for engagement inference, and for the selection and optimization of delivery strategies, existing graph models seldom can capture the multi-scale temporal, semantic and higher-order dependency features of these interaction networks, thus it's hard to describe the complicated patterns of the anonymous behavior. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Temporal-Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (DTH-GNN), which achieves three main contributions. Above all, we introduce temporal edge decomposition, which divides each interaction into three types of channels: short-term burst, diurnal cycle and long-range memory, and conducts feature extraction using the convolution kernel of parallel dilated residuals; Furthermore, our model builds a hierarchical heterogeneous aggregation, where user-user, user-advertisement, advertisement-advertisement subgraphs are combined through the meta-path conditional Transformer encoder, where the noise structure is dynamically tamped down via the synergy of cross-channel self-attention and gating relationship selector. Thirdly, the contrast regularity of feedback perception is formulated, the consistency of various time slices is maximized, the entropy of control exposure information with dual-view target is maximized, the global prototype of dual-momentum queue distillation is presented, and the strategy gradient layer with light weight is combined with delaying transformation signal to fine-tune the node representation for benefit-oriented. The AUC of DTH-GNN improved by 8.2\% and the logarithmic loss improved by 5.7\% in comparison with the best baseline model.},

abstract = {Intent detection and slot filling are core sub-tasks in natural language understanding for building intelligent dialogue systems. This paper proposes a joint model named GAT-SAL, which integrates subword attention mechanisms and graph attention networks to address semantic loss caused by BERT's Wordpiece tokenization and to enhance bidirectional semantic interactions between intent and slot features. The model adopts a two-stage feature fusion strategy: in the first stage, the GAT module explicitly constructs a semantic graph between intent and slot features; in the second stage, the subword attention fusion layer enriches the semantic representation of complex words by aggregating subword-level information. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, ATIS and SNIPS, demonstrate that GAT-SAL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, including intent classification accuracy, slot filling F1 score, and sentence-level semantic frame accuracy. Specifically, the model achieves 98.54\% intent accuracy, 97.22\% slot filling F1, and 89.70\% sentence-level accuracy on the ATIS dataset; and 98.72\%, 97.60\%, and 92.86\% respectively on the SNIPS dataset. In addition, ablation studies further confirm the importance of each module (SAL, GAT, and CRF) in contributing to the overall performance of the model.},

abstract = {Automatic melanoma detection from dermoscopic skin samples is one of the most challenging tasks in medical image analysis. Deep Convolutional Networks (DCN) have emerged as practical tools in addressing these challenges, particularly in skin cancer diagnosis. The research aims to explore the performance of various neural networks in skin cancer recognition, assessing metrics such as accuracy (ACC), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The study uses modified DCN classifiers, namely ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121, on the HAM10000 dataset. The results demonstrate that the modified InceptionV3 exhibited high performance compared to other networks, achieving a weighted accuracy of 86.58\% and a weighted ROC of 0.96. This model's advantage lies in its efficient feature extraction capability and acceptable inference time per epoch. The study concludes that DCN provides a reliable framework for automating melanoma diagnosis and expediting identification, potentially saving lives. The paper also delves into the dataset preprocessing, model optimization strategies, and detailed performance analysis of the modified models. Key findings include the superior performance of the modified InceptionV3 in skin cancer classification and its potential to enhance early skin cancer detection, aligning with developing an efficient melanoma detection method.},

abstract = {In the field of intelligent financial analytics, traditional rule-based and statistical methods often struggle with low efficiency and limited generalizability when handling large-scale corporate reporting data. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multi-task model for the automatic classification and forecasting of financial statements. By encoding structured financial tables into matrix form and applying a custom-designed CNN architecture with shared and task-specific layers, the model jointly performs corporate health classification and key indicator prediction. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset of 90 publicly listed companies across three major industries, utilizing real-world balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow reports. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline models such as SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, achieving a classification F1-score of 91.5\% and a regression R² of 0.852. Ablation studies further validate the importance of convolutional depth and multi-task learning in improving generalization and accuracy. The model offers a scalable and adaptable solution for enterprise-level financial document processing, with potential applications in automated risk assessment, credit analysis, and audit support systems.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), their potential in time series prediction tasks is gradually being explored. LLMs possess strong feature representation capabilities and the ability to model complex relationships. They have shown significant advantages in areas such as text generation, classification, and time series prediction. However, pre-trained LLMs usually perform well on general tasks but are difficult to apply directly to specific tasks. Fine-tuning is required to adapt them to target domain characteristics. Meanwhile, hotel booking data is often distributed across multiple organizations. This data is privacy-sensitive and unevenly distributed, making traditional centralized training methods unsuitable for privacy protection and collaborative modeling. To address these issues, we propose FPTuning-LLM, a fine-tuning framework for large language models based on Federated Learning and P-Tuning. But time series data cannot be directly input into LLMs trained on discrete tokens. Therefore, we use Time-LLM to embed input sequences and convert them into representations suitable for LLMs. Prompt design is crucial for downstream task performance. We adopt P-Tuning to fine-tune Time-LLM, utilizing lightweight parameters to improve task adaptation. In a federated learning environment, we perform global fusion on the embedding layers of Time-LLM and the LSTM+MLP network in P-Tuning. To address the issue of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data, FedProx is used to constrain local training, enhancing model robustness and global convergence. Experimental results show that FPTuning-LLM effectively improves prediction accuracy while ensuring data privacy by leveraging private data from multiple parties.},

abstract = {Technological intervention to support care areas that some people may not have access to is of paramount importance to promote sustainable development of good health and wellbeing. This study aims to explore the linguistic similarities and differences between human professionals and Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) conversational agents in therapeutic dialogues. Initially, the MISTRAL-7B Large Language Model (LLM) is instructed to generate responses to patient queries to form a synthetic equivalent to a publicly available psychology dataset. A large set of linguistic features (e.g., text metrics, lexical diversity and richness, readability scores, sentiment, emotions, and named entities) is extracted and studied from both the expert and synthetically-generated text. The results suggest a significantly richer vocabulary in humans than the LLM approach. Similarly, the use of sentiment was significantly different between the two, suggesting a difference in the supportive or objective language used and that synthetic linguistic expressions of emotion may differ from those expressed by an intelligent being. However, no statistical significance was observed between human professionals and AI in the use of function words, pronouns and several named entities; possibly reflecting an increased proficiency of LLMs in modelling some language patterns, even in a specialised context (i.e., therapy). However, current findings do not support the similarity in sentimental nuance and emotional expression, which limits the effectiveness of contemporary LLMs as standalone agents. Further development is needed towards clinically validated algorithms.},

Among AML algorithms, transaction-graph-based algorithms achieve satisfactory performance by leveraging graph learning methods. However, existing algorithms focus on extracting features from nodes in transaction graphs and overlook a special node type—nodes that served as money mules. Money mules are key links in the money laundering chain, which transfer illicit money for criminals. In this work, we combine graph learning methods with money mules detection to empower AML. Specifically, we propose a novel framework, named MuleTrace, that utilizes money mules as leads to detect money laundering chains in an unsupervised manner. Numerical experiments on real-world money laundering datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the MuleTrace.},

Existing research has shown that the third type of agency cost has a certain impact on corporate innovation. This article, based on agency theory and organizational ambidexterity theory, utilizes panel data from 2802 Chinese listed companies from 2014 to 2023. It categorizes corporate innovation into exploratory innovation and exploitative innovation, investigating the impact of the third type of agency cost on these two types of innovation and the moderating effect of absorptive capacity. The results indicate that the third type of agency cost is significantly positively correlated with exploratory innovation and significantly negatively correlated with exploitative innovation. Absorptive capacity enhances the relationship between the third type of agency cost and the ambidextrous innovation of enterprises. The study provides theoretical support for enterprises to determine a reasonable innovation strategy by adjusting the third type of agency cost in conjunction with their own capabilities.},

abstract = {The way colleges and unis manage their policy documents has always had problems with stuff being all over the place and it being hard to find what you're looking for. This analysis puts forward a method for creating a knowledge graph for university policy documents using natural language processing, as well as a technical framework for identifying policy entities and extracting relationships between them. It also develops a system for combining knowledge and making inferences, and achieves organised representation and smart use of policy documents. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in enhancing policy retrieval accuracy, facilitating policy consistency testing and optimising policy interpretation, thereby providing a technical foundation for the modernisation of university policy governance. This method can also be applied to other types of policy documents in knowledge management.},
